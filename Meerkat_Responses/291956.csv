","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a history of lung adenocarcinoma status post lobectomy. She presents with complaints of dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF). 

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient was found to have oxygen saturation of 75% on room air and was placed on a non-rebreather mask, resulting in an increase in her oxygen saturation to 100%. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). 

The patient appears anxious and states that she feels like she is dying. She complains of pain and has been taking Vicodin for vertebral compression fractures. She was given 1 IV morphine. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 92 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 152/39 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on high flow nasal cannula. 

The patient has a history of allergies to codeine phosphate/apap/caffeine/butalbital (oral), insomnia. She has not received any antibiotics recently. 

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and previous lung adenocarcinoma status post lobectomy. She presents with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF). Upon admission, the patient was placed on non-rebreather and showed improvement in oxygen saturation levels. However, her condition worsened, and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/39-68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow nasal cannula. She has decreased breath sounds at the right base, and a persistent right lower lobe effusion with fluffy opacities on chest X-ray. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with gram-negative rods and multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora on Gram stain.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary issues include dyspnea, ARF, hypernatremia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and pain/anxiety. The differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonia versus improperly treated hospital-acquired pneumonia. Due to leukocytosis and CXR findings, there is concern for aspiration pneumonia or mucus plugging/atelectasis. Further workup includes blood, sputum, and urine"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of lung CA and s/p resection now s/p ABX
   coure of treatment at NWH and in that setting right sided effusion was
   not tapped based on patient request and of concern is significant
   aspiration risk documented. In that setting she went to rehab placement
   and at intake patient with saturations of 70% noted on room air and
   patient returned to acute care facility at [**Hospital1 54**] for management of
   hypoxemia and hypotension.  Of note in the ED saturations had improved
   without intervention in ED and hypotension did show good response to
   initial IVF bolus.  This would argue for a situation of hypovolemia as
   evidenced by any number of measures (increased HCT, increase Na+) and
   persistent pulmonary infection as well.
   Hypoxemia-Likely a combination of pleural effusions and persistent
   pneumonia given findings of bandemia and persistent infiltate
   -Pneumonia-
   -ABX to cover hosptial acquired organisms is
   essential--vanco/Flagyl/Zosyn
   -Will need pulmonary ""toilet"" with cough, chest PT and OOB as possible.
   -OOB to chair as possible
   Pleural Effusion-
   -Is longstanding although there is some concern for infection in the
   setting of persistent bandemia
   -Would favor tap for both symptoms management and diagnostic yield if
   patient is in agreement and able to comply with procedure.  There are
   mulitple areas of collapse suggested on the left which may be a primary
   contributor as well.
   Pulmonary Infiltrate-
   -Patient with consolidation on left side as well based on exam.
   Certainly antibiotics and OOB
Chair
deep cough and chest PT will be
   essential to establish stable oxygenation.
   -Vanco/Zosyn and will modify based on culture results
   Sepsis
   There is a concern for sepsis and she certainly meets critera for
   Sepsis with SIRS and suspected source of infection in her lungs or
   pleural space.  Initial treatment with volume had reasonable response
   initially but with persistent hypoxemia there is a concern for
   evolution of pulmonary edema as well.
   -Volume bolus as needed based on BP which has responded.
   -Abx as above
   -Follow up culture results

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of lung cancer and recent antibiotic treatment. She presented to the ICU with hypoxemia and hypotension. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C, heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 123/61 mmHg, respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. She is on high flow nasal cannula for respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, with increased breath sound volume in the left lower lobe (LLL) distribution. This suggests areas of consolidation and clear dullness at the right base. The patient has a right-sided pleural effusion and patchy opacities in the left lower lobe on chest X-ray. Her peripheral pulses are absent on the right side, while on the left side, they are present but not assessed. 

The patient has fatigue and dysphagia, and is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, band percentage, and C-reactive protein level. Imaging reveals a moderate-sized right-sided effusion and patchy opacities in the left LLL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's condition is complex and multifactorial. The assessment includes hypoxemia, pneumonia, pleural effusion, and sepsis. The plan involves antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired organisms, pulmonary ""toilet"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a history of lung adenocarcinoma status post lobectomy. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient has received two boluses for mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the low range. She has allergies to codeine phosphate/APAP/Caff/Butalb. Her last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She is currently receiving infusions of morphine sulfate and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include changes to her medical and family history, with a review of systems unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet Data:
- Vital signs: Maximum temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), current temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate (HR) of 106 bpm with a range of 92-106 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 115/56 mmHg to 146/67 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute with a range of 21-36 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 92%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Total in 5,780 mL, out 975 mL, IV fluid (IVF) 3,970 mL, urine output 795 mL.
- Fluid balance: Total in 4,805 mL, out 975 mL, net balance -1,020 mL.
- Respiratory support: High flow nebulizer, SpO2 at 92%, arterial blood gas (ABG) results pending.
- Physical examination: General appearance, lungs, cardiovascular system (CV), abdomen (Abd), extremities (Ext).
- Labs/Radiology: Complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), glucose, electrolytes, etc. Imaging studies include chest X-ray (CXR) images from [**7-2**] and [**7-1**].
- Microbiology: Sputum gram stain showing gram-negative rods and multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea: Concern for aspiration pneumonia (PN) versus improperly treated hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Patient also has component of mucus plugging and atelectasis. Given recent unremarkable adenosine MIBI at NWH, further cardiac workup will be deferred. Follow-up blood, sputum culture (cx), and urine culture (cx) pending. Continue vancomycin/Zosyn, need antibiotic approval; await [**Last Name (un)**] for possible double antibiotic coverage for pseudomonas. Discontinue flagyl. Perform pulmonary toilet, nebulizers, and mucolytics. Wean oxygen as tolerated, currently on face mask (FT). May need to go back to nasal cannula (NRB). Repeat CXR in the morning, consider computed tomography (CT) chest if concern for effusion which may be amenable to thoracentesis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and previous lung adenocarcinoma status post lobectomy. She presented with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF). She received two 500mL boluses for low blood pressure and responded well. However, she developed tachycardia in the morning, which was not responsive to fluids.

Subjective:
The patient reported worsening shortness of breath and constant coughing without bringing up phlegm. She had difficulty sleeping and was agitated, leading to the administration of trazodone, which caused a drop in blood pressure.

Objective:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is slightly elevated, blood pressure is low, respiratory rate is increased, and oxygen saturation is at 92%.
- Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base, a rapid heart rate with regular rhythm, and the presence of a systolic murmur.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- Imaging studies show moderate-sized right and small left pleural effusions on the previous day's chest X-ray (CXR). The current CXR reveals denser opacities in the left lung field, suggesting atelectasis or possible pneumonia. There is also an increased prominence of pulmonary vessels, indicating overhydration.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of lung cancer resection who is currently experiencing respiratory distress and tachycardia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, and there is evidence of pulmonary edema contributing to the respiratory distress. The patient's acute renal failure has improved with hydration, and hypertension is being managed with a beta-blocker. The patient also has back pain and a decubitus ulcer, for which pain medication and wound care are being provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia, further deterioration of renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, and potential infections related to the presence of lines or wounds. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to manage these conditions."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of lung cancer and a recent left lower lobe resection. The patient has been experiencing worsening tachycardia and mild hypotension overnight. Despite receiving several normal saline (NS) boluses, there has been no change in her hemodynamics. The patient is not short of breath.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to codeine phosphate/apap/caff/butalbital (oral), insomnia, and a previous antibiotic treatment with metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient is currently on several infusions and medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a current temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/72 mmHg to 83/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, cardiovascular tachycardia, and respiratory tachypnea. The flowsheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and other relevant information.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F MMP including CAD, DM, h/o lung adenocarcinoma s/p lobectomy
   p/w aspiration PNA - CMO
   .
   # Dyspnea
   Given leukocytosis and CXR concern is for aspiration PNA versus
   improperly treated HAP.  Patient also likely has component of mucus
   plugging and atelectasis. Given recent unremarkable adenosine MIBI at
   NWH will defer further cardiac workup.  Resp status slightly worse this
   morning after fluid boluses overnight
   - will give lasix 10 IV now and reassess.
   - f/u blood, sputum cx, urine cx
 will obtain 2nd sputum cx.
   - continue Vanco/Zosyn
 need abx approval; await [**Last Name (un) **] for possible
   double abx for pseudomonas.
   - pulmonary toilet
   - nebulizers and mucolytics
   - wean oxygen as tolerated, on FT currently
 may need to go back to
   NRB
   - repeat CXR in AM, consider CT chest if concern for effusion which may
   be amenable to TC
   - consider thoracentesis if resp status not improving.
   .
   # ARF on CKD
 creatinine down to 1 this am
   .
   # Hypernatremia
  resolving, may improve further with lasix
   # HTN --
   -          She takes Propranolol 20 mg PO QID, Valsartan 80 mg PO daily
   and Verapamil 180 mg SR daily as outpatient
   -          Consider adding back propranolol today.
   # tachycardia
 not responsive to IVF.  Most likely secondary to resp
   distress this morning
   -          will give lasix to improve resp status
   -          may add propranolol today for better rate control.
   # DM
   - sliding scale insulin and readdress insulin needs
   # Pain/ anxiety -  Now that patient can take pills try Tylenol first.
   - patient on low dose vicodin as outpatient for compression fxs.
   # Skin
 sacral decubitus
 routine wound care.  continue to monitor.
   # Code- confirmed DNR/DNI with her son [**Name (NI) 297**] [**Name (NI) 3743**], cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3744**]
   # PPX- sq heparin, pneumoboots
   # FEN- bedside s/s study done.  Patient okay to have thickened diet and
   crushed pills.
