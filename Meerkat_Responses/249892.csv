   Assessment and Plan
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.
   .
   FEN: NPO

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, pneumo boots when heparin drip
   discontinued
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted with a STEMI, who underwent a catheterization procedure that resulted in an acute occlusion of the OM due to an embolus. The patient has been unstable and required intubation and IABP placement. The patient's current medications include integrillin, heparin, dopamine, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and carafate. 

The patient's physical examination reveals warm skin, normal neurologic assessment, and heart sounds difficult to auscultate due to the IABP. The chest x-ray shows the IABP in the proximal position near the great vessels, and the PA catheter in good position.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated WBC count, Hct, and creatinine levels, as well as elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T), liver enzymes (ALT, AST), and lactic acid. The patient's electrolytes show low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing integrillin for 18 hours post-cath, continuing heparin while on IABP, increasing atorvastatin to 80 mg in the setting of ACS, attempting to wean dopamine, attempting to wean IABP today, reaching goal PA diastolic pressure of 25 via volume, then attempting to wean to 1:2, obtaining SvO2, PaO2, and Hb, and calculating cardiac index; if data shows stability, will continue 1:4, 1:8 as able.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Heart failure due to the patient's history of ACS and subsequent interventions.
2. Infection due to the presence of an endotracheal tube and IABP.
3. Renal failure due to pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy, ATN, or IABP renal artery obstruction.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of UGIB and continued use of anticoagulation.
5. Hypotension due to the patient's current medications and ongoing management.
6. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged intubation.
7. Arrhythmias, particularly complete heart block given the patient's history of A Fib and RBBB.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac function, renal function, and coagulation status. Regular reassessment of the patient's condition and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hematemesis (upper gastrointestinal bleed), cardiogenic shock, and acute myocardial infarction. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 92/35 mmHg to 154/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.6°C.

The patient has been started on multiple invasive procedures including arterial line, IABP line, sheath, invasive ventilation, and PA catheter. The patient also underwent an endoscopy.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of glucose, white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, troponin-T, lactate, and lactic acid. Other lab values are within normal range or show mild abnormalities.

The patient's respiratory support consists of being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 308, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 19 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals the absence of peripheral vascular pulses assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB): The patient has a history of hematemesis, indicating a potential complication related to the gastrointestinal tract. This could lead to ongoing bleeding, hypotension, and shock.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated cardiac biomarkers suggest cardiogenic shock, which is a serious complication following a myocardial infarction. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.

3. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): The patient's symptoms, elevated cardiac biomarkers, and ECG changes indicate an AMI. This condition can further complicate the patient's clinical status and increase the risk of adverse outcomes.

4. Infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay, invasive procedures, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential renal impairment. This could be due to hypotension, use of nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis.

6. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and the use of an endotracheal tube increase the risk of ventilator-associated events"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been admitted with several medical interventions and conditions. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are documented, including the start of arterial and IABP lines, sheath insertion, invasive ventilation, and PA catheter placement. The patient also underwent an endoscopy due to hematemesis, which revealed possible lower esophageal tears. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to Vioxx, Bactrim, codeine, aspirin, and ranitidine. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for sedation assessment. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 79 bpm with a range of 67-94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60/13 mmHg to 154/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute with a range of 13-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) at 35/15 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) at 5.5 L/min and 3 L/min/m2 respectively, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) at 64%, and other pertinent data related to fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values. 

Physical examination findings include warm skin, normal neurologic assessment, and various abnormalities in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. 

Laboratory values indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, lactate, and lactic acid levels, along with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). 

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this information include but are not limited to:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, indicating potential hypotension.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation may drop below normal levels during ventilator weaning.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Elevated creatinine levels suggest possible renal impairment.
4. Infection: The elevated WBC count and abnormal liver function tests may indicate an ongoing infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Cardiac dysfunction: Abnormalities in the cardiovascular system, such as murmur and difficult auscultation of heart sounds, suggest possible cardiac dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip

   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic renal failure, who presented with symptoms of an acute anterior myocardial infarction (heart attack). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and thrombectomy of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion with successful restoration of blood flow. However, the patient developed acute occlusion of the obtuse marginal (OM) artery due to an embolus, which was treated with thrombectomy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The patient remained unstable and required intubation and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for hemodynamic support.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including acute respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilation, acute renal failure, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with evidence of a possible lower esophageal tear. The patient is currently on multiple medications including integrilin, heparin, dopamine, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and carafate. The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, requiring adjustments in medication dosages and fluid management.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: Continue integrilin and heparin therapy. The patient will be started on atorvastatin 80 mg in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Dopamine will be continued for goal mean arterial"

","The patient is a 64-year-old overweight/obese male with a chief complaint of a cardiac arrest. The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) at 10:47 AM on 9/2, which showed signs of shock, other. The patient was tanked up with fluids to increase preload prior to weaning intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient's platelet count is dropping rapidly, and there are abnormally high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The patient also has high levels of troponin-T and C-reactive protein (CRP). These findings suggest the possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), myocardial infarction, and sepsis.

The patient experienced a rapid then slow atrial fibrillation (a-fib) with no pulse, leading to a code being called and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) initiated. The patient regained pulse, but the rhythm strip was unclear whether it was ventricular tachycardia (VT) or a-fib with aberrancy. No shock was given. The family was informed of the situation and agreed not to escalate care, as the patient had previously discussed his wishes with them.

Midnight labs showed a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 28% to 22%, so the patient was given 1 unit of blood. The patient received 3 liters of intravenous fluids overnight after the code. Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could indicate a bacterial infection.

The patient's allergies include wheezing to Vioxx (rofecoxib), Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), unknown reactions to codeine, aspirin, and ranitidine. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin at 10:00 AM on 9/2 and cefepime at 12:27 PM on 9/2.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam (versed) at 2 mg/hour, fentanyl (concentrate) at 50 mcg/hour, heparin sodium at 400 units/hour, and dopamine at 12.5 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include dextrose 50% at 02:16 AM on 9/3, pantoprazole (Protonix) at 05:26 AM on 9/3, and carafate (sucralfate) at 05:26 AM on 9/3.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.7 F), heart rate of 102 bpm with irregular rhythm, blood pressure of 104/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per"

   Assessment and Plan
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, presenting with a STEMI. The patient underwent successful thrombectomy of the proximal LAD occlusion but developed acute occlusion of the OM due to an embolus, treated with thrombectomy and PTCA. The patient was unstable during the procedure and subsequently intubated and placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). 

The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple complications including cardiac arrest, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient has a history of asthma, diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal failure, gout, and GERD. 

Current medications include dopamine for hemodynamic support, heparin for anticoagulation, ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin, and pantoprazole. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated troponin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile. 

The patient's plan includes weaning off the IABP, attempting to wear off heparin, and transitioning to outpatient medications including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and statins. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recent myocardial infarction. There is a potential for further cardiac events such as recurrent ischemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.
   .
   FEN: NPO

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, pneumo boots when heparin drip
   discontinued
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace

","The patient's progress note indicates several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest on 09/02/2130 at 07:32 PM, which required resuscitation efforts.

2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's platelet count is dropping rapidly, and there are high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). These findings suggest a possible development of DIC.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, indicating respiratory failure.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and recent creatinine levels show worsening kidney function. Possible etiologies include pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. Renal dose medications should be adjusted, and careful volume management is necessary.

5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypocalcemia (Ca++: 7.6 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia (PO4: 5.0 mg/dL).

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - will attempt to wean IABP: will discuss with family prior to pulling
   pump, as it could precipitation bradycardia, vagal reflex, bleeding,
   etc.
   - will continue dopamine, titrate to MAP in 60s.   IVF as needed.  Per
   discussion with family, will not add another pressor if needed for BP
   support
   - will transfuse PRBCs as needed
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now, plan to pull lines when
   patient more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and Plts, replete as needed
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes and hypertension who presented with a STEMI. She underwent catheterization and thrombectomy of the proximal LAD and OM arteries, but developed acute occlusion of the OM due to an embolus. The patient was intubated and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed. She has had multiple complications including cardiogenic shock, sepsis, acute renal failure, and a lower gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's current condition is unstable, and she is receiving supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation of STEMI and subsequent development of cardiogenic shock indicate a compromised cardiac function. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to maintain adequate blood flow and organ perfusion.

2. Sepsis: The positive blood culture indicating gram-positive cocci in clusters suggests a bacterial infection. The combination of sepsis and hemodynamic instability may necessitate broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of chronic renal failure suggest a decline in kidney function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and fluid balance is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Lower gastrointestinal bleed: The endoscopy findings of a friable esophagus with blood clot at the gastroesophageal junction indicate active bleeding. Ongoing assessment and management are essential to control the"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - will attempt to wean IABP: will discuss with family prior to pulling
   pump, as it could precipitation bradycardia, vagal reflex, bleeding,
   etc.
   - will continue dopamine, titrate to MAP in 60s.   IVF as needed.  Per
   discussion with family, will not add another pressor if needed for BP
   support
   - will transfuse PRBCs as needed
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now, plan to pull lines when
   patient more stable

   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present

   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and Plts, replete as needed
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab, currently intubated on
   pressors being weaned off a balloon pump, also with coag positive staph
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - Call family as patient not improving, discuss poor prognosis as
   patient not improving.  Discuss withdrawal of care.
   - Will pull IABP, as patient not improving on balloon pump and
   platelets low, possibly [**1-9**] balloon pump, also with possible
   bacteremia.  Will not escalate care after pulling IABP.
   - Will titrate down dopamine.
   - Will not further transfuse PRBCs
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - Will continue to monitor Hct and Plts
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.
   .
   FEN: NPO
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, pneumo boots when heparin drip
   discontinued
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace
   .
   CODE: DNR - confirmed with [**Last Name (un) **].  [**Name (NI) 440**] discussed with family
   escalation of care, but will not withdraw any care at present.  Not

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with diabetes and hypertension who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was brought to the catheterization lab. The patient is currently intubated on pressors and being weaned off a balloon pump, with coag-positive Staph bacteremia.

The patient's current medical conditions include shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease with occlusions in the left anterior descending artery and obtuse marginal branch, acute kidney injury, upper gastrointestinal bleed, asthma, gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The patient has a poor prognosis and is not improving. The healthcare team has decided to withdraw care and focus on comfort measures only. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and they will not escalate care after pulling the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Complete heart block: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at high risk to develop complete heart block due to left anterior fascicular block and right bundle branch block seen on the electrocardiogram (ECG).

2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed, as evidenced by the findings of a friable esophagus with blood clot at the gastroesophageal junction on endoscopy.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - will attempt to wean IABP: will discuss with family prior to pulling
   pump, as it could precipitation bradycardia, vagal reflex, bleeding,
   etc.
   - will continue dopamine, titrate to MAP in 60s.   IVF as needed.  Per
   discussion with family, will not add another pressor if needed for BP
   support
   - will transfuse PRBCs as needed
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now, plan to pull lines when
   patient more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and Plts, replete as needed
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was brought to the catheterization laboratory for immediate intervention. The patient experienced shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology, leading to the placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and intubation. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) with a left anterior fascicular block and right bundle branch block, which puts her at high risk for developing complete heart block. Additionally, the patient has a blood culture positive for bacteria and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's coagulation profile indicates low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with declining platelets. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with mixed cardiogenic and septic shock, which required aggressive management including the placement of an IABP and intubation. Continuous monitoring and optimization of hemodynamics are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Complete Heart Block: Due to the patient's history of AF and the presence of left anterior fascicular block and right bundle branch block, there is a high risk of developing complete heart block. Continuous monitoring of heart rhythm and consideration for pacing may be necessary to maintain adequate cardiac output.
3. Infection: The patient has a blood culture positive for bacteria, indicating a potential bloodstream infection. Continued administration of broad"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes. Greater than 50% time
   counseling / coordinating care.
   Additional comments:
   Due to overwhelming nature of patient's illness and near-impossibility
   of chance of reasonable recovery, along with her stated wishes
   (confirmed by family) to not have extreme end of life measures, we will
   withdraw the current intensive level of care and make the patient
   comfortable. Family meeting (including Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3342**] and Nurse [**Last Name (Titles) 9070**])
   during which family agreed with this plan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is STEMI, and they have a history of UGI bleed, cardiac arrest during this hospitalization, and septic physiology. The patient is currently on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and has a recent thrombectomy of the proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual stenosis, as well as acute occlusion of OM treated with thrombectomy and PTCA.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/43 mmHg to 70/25 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support.

The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, irregular heart rhythm, no murmurs, 2+ radial pulses, CTA bilaterally anteriorly, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurologically, the patient opens their eyes to voice but cannot follow commands.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 8.5 to 12.3 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 22.4% and 27.4%, platelet count between 66 and 48 K/uL, creatinine levels of 2.4 and 2.8 mg/dL, blood glucose levels of 138 and 156 mg/dL, and various other lab abnormalities.

The patient has several medical complications including shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology, atrial fibrillation, risk for complete heart block, coagulopathy with declining platelets, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient also has a history of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, gout, GERD, and upper gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's assessment and plan include weaning off the IABP, titrating down dopamine, not further transfusing packed red blood cells, continuing antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime, and monitoring for potential complications such as complete heart block and UGI bleed recurrence.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and the medical team is working to manage multiple complex medical complications while considering the patient's wishes to avoid extreme end-of-life measures."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent emergency cardiac catheterization, during which she experienced an acute occlusion of the left circumflex artery due to an embolus. The occlusion was treated with thrombectomy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), but the patient remained unstable and required intubation and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). She also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiac arrest during this hospitalization. Currently, she is on mechanical ventilation with assisted spontaneous breathing, and her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 107/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a left anterior fascicular block and right bundle branch block on ECG, which puts her at high risk for developing complete heart block. The patient's coagulation profile shows low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with declining platelet counts, but they are currently stable in the high 40s. She has positive blood cultures for coagulasive-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, for which she is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 2.8 mg/d"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab, currently intubated on
   pressors being weaned off a balloon pump, also with coag positive staph
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - Call family as patient not improving, discuss poor prognosis as
   patient not improving.  Discuss withdrawal of care.
   - Will pull IABP, as patient not improving on balloon pump and
   platelets low, possibly [**1-9**] balloon pump, also with possible
   bacteremia.  Will not escalate care after pulling IABP.
   - Will titrate down dopamine.
   - Will not further transfuse PRBCs
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - Will continue to monitor Hct and Plts
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, pneumo boots when heparin drip
   discontinued
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). She presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent an emergent cardiac catheterization, where she had a thrombectomy of proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion with 20% residual stenosis. However, she developed acute occlusion of the obtuse marginal branch (OM) due to an embolus, which was treated with thrombectomy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using a 2.5x12mm balloon. The patient was unstable during the procedure and subsequently intubated and placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient's current condition includes septic physiology, atrial fibrillation (AF), and a history of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding. Her vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
- Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 76-110 bpm
- Blood pressure: 107/43 mmHg with a range of 70-119/25-85 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 7 breaths per minute (inspiration)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube with ventil"
