   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   -broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn
   -f/u CXR from admission
   -f/u sputum GS and culture, UA, UCx, BCx
   -dopamine was switched to neo given ectopy.
   -f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. Cardiac
   -hold diuresis
   -would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   -IJ central line placed, consider CVP measurement
   -consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.
   -monitor on tele
   -would benefit from cardioversion which was planned for today but will
   hold off until medically stable
   -hold rate control given sepsis
   -hold anticoagulation as subratherapeutic INR.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   -trend CEZ
   -cont asa, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as elytes are
   within normal limits.
   -correct INR (see below)
   -f/u CT head noncontrast
   -intubated for airway protection
   -monitor elytes
   -treat infection as above
   -hold amytriptiline
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ishcemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and fibrinogen.
   -given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   -give 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   -trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 2.5 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. Also possible is ATN is setting of hypoperfusion with low
   CO. Also has history of elevated PSA so BPH and postobstructive is
   possible but patient has foley in place but it has been intermittantly
   clotted.
   -give 1L fluid
   -would like to give acetylcysteine prior to contrast load but may not
   be time.
   -f/u urine lytes
   -f/u UA and UCX
   -in future consider renal ultrasound
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis.
   -trend LFTS
   -f/u CT abd
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   -hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   -cont RISS
   -follow BS, if continuously elevated can resume lantus and low dose
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.
   -monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   -hold advair while intubated
   -ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   -vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   -cont wound care
   -cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.
   -cont CBI(althought it makes urine output difficult to monitor)
   -consider Urology consult if not improving.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.
   -readdress when more stable
   -hold amytriptilline

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.

   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. Cardiac
   -hold diuresis
   -would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   -CVP looks even, though complicated by poor flow
   -consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes

   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.
   -monitor on tele

   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   -trend CEZ, some contribution of renal faillure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   -cont asa, hold gemfibrozil and BB

   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.

   -Cont. Vanc and Zosyn
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as elytes are
   within normal limits.

   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ishcemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and fibrinogen.
   -given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   -give 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   -trend coags

   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 2.5 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. Also possible is ATN is setting of hypoperfusion with low
   CO. Also has history of elevated PSA so BPH and postobstructive is
   possible but patient has foley in place but it has been intermittantly
   clotted.

   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.

   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 8949**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Unresponsive.
   TEE with left atrial and vent thrombus so not candidate for DCCV.
   Off Amio.
   EEG and MRI for neuro eval.
   Urine output better on Milrinone.  Cr 3.2
   Medical Decision Making
   Will reassess neuro status and discuss plans with family.
   Prognosis very poor.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, diabetes mellitus (DM), recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (Afib), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and flash pulmonary edema. The patient presented with right leg edema and was found non-responsive and hypoxic. He was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) from another hospital. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, left atrial appendage thrombus, severe thoracic aortic atherosclerosis, mesenteric ischemia, hepatic congestion, renal failure, hyperbilirubinemia, and polycythemia. He also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, anxiety, and a Foley catheter in place.

Assessment and plan:
1. The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to leukocytosis, elevated lactate, AMS, and possible sources of infection such as mesenteric ischemia, HAP/aspiration, or pneumonia. The patient is being treated with vancomycin for presumed sepsis.
2. The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and he is now non-responsive. He has had episodes of hypoglyc"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.9
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis, continue milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - pressor dependent (milrinone +/- phenylephrine)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as elytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - give 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.
   - D/C CBI
   - Had good UOP on lasix
   - follow now that he is on milrinone alone
   - follow urine outputs
   - give 1L fluid
   - send urine cx
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis.
   -trend LFTS

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.9
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis, continue milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - pressor dependent (milrinone +/- phenylephrine)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - give 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.
   - D/C CBI
   - Had good UOP on lasix
   - follow now that he is on milrinone alone
   - follow urine outputs
   - give 1L fluid
   - send urine cx
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis.
   - trend LFTS
   - f/u CT abd
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   - follow BS, if continuously elevated can resume lantus and low dose
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.
   - d/ced CBI
   - consider Urology consult if not improving.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, diabetes mellitus (DM), recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (Afib), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He was transferred from Hospital3 with right leg edema and weeping on 09/22. He was then transferred from Hospital1 to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- He is non-responsive and intubated for airway protection.
- He has a heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation (Afib).
- He has severe biventricular systolic dysfunction.
- He has moderate mitral regurgitation.
- He has severe thoracic aortic atherosclerosis.
- He has a left atrial appendage thrombus.
- He has leukocytosis and elevated lactate, which are concerning for sepsis.
- He has a history of mesenteric ischemia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), aspiration, and cholangitis.
- He has AMS (altered mental status) with myoclonic jerks, possibly due to toxic-metabolic causes.
- His INR is supratherapeutic, and he received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
- He has transam"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to right leg edema and weeping. The patient presented with non-responsive and hypoxic status, and was transferred from another hospital. 

The patient's current condition includes severe cardiogenic shock, likely due to end-stage CHF, possible contribution of sepsis, and hypoperfusion. He has an elevated lactate level indicating lactic acidosis, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer, and elevated liver enzymes. His mental status is altered, and he is experiencing myoclonic jerks. He has a history of falls and a normal head CT. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.4°C, heart rate 117 bpm (108-140), blood pressure 101/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 99% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure, elevated lactate levels, and signs of hypoper"

   Large atelectasis in the left lower lobe new from [**9-27**] is
   unchanged from [**9-28**]. Small left pleural effusion is
   stable. Minimal right upper lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis is
   unchanged. Lines and tubes remain in place in standard position. There
   is no evidence of CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 10%, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. He was transferred from another hospital with right leg edema and weeping. The patient presented as non-responsive and hypoxic, leading to his transfer to the critical care unit (CCU). 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), sepsis, cholangitis, cardiogenic shock, and hyperbilirubinemia. His mental status has fluctuated, and he has shown signs of myoclonic jerks, which may be toxic-metabolic in nature. He also has leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 117 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 35, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

   Large atelectasis in the left lower lobe new from [**9-27**] is
   unchanged from [**9-28**]. Small left pleural effusion is
   stable. Minimal right upper lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis is
   unchanged. Lines and tubes remain in place in standard position. There
   is no evidence of CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.  Progressively worsening, Cr
   now > 4.
   - follow urine outputs
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis. CT abd is benign.
   - trend LFTS

   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock

   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recently diagnosed with pneumonia. He was found non-responsive and hypoxic and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) from Hospital1.

The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including sepsis, cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic congestion, hyperbilirubinemia, hypertension, hypoxemia, and anxiety. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), leg edema, and ulcers. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. AG Met acidosis: The patient has had an AG metabolic acidosis since September 25th with elevated lactate levels. Alkalosis was observed due to contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis and respiratory alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated lactate, increased respiratory rate (RR), tachycardia, altered mental status (AMS), and leukocytosis are concerning for sepsis. HAP/aspiration is likely given his recent hospitalizations and AMS. C. difficile is negative, and no diarrhea is present.

2. PUMP: The patient's EF is 10%, thought"

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, diabetes mellitus (DM), recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (Afib), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and flash pulmonary edema. He was transferred from Hospital3 with right leg edema and weeping on 09/22. He presented as transfer from Hospital1 to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with recent deterioration in EF, suspected to be ischemic in nature. He has had episodes of hypoxia, respiratory arrest, and has been on mechanical ventilation since 09/25. He also has a history of falls and hit his head two days prior to transfer, but the head CT was normal at the time.

Assessment and Plan:
1. AG Met acidosis: The patient has had an AG metabolic acidosis since 09/25 with lactate of 8. He was alkalotic 12/21 due to contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis and respiratory alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated lactate, elevated respiratory rate, tachycardia, altered mental status (AMS), and leukocytosis concerning for sepsis.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.  Progressively worsening, Cr
   now > 4.
   - follow urine outputs
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis. CT abd is benign.
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.  CBI was d/ced, currently resolved.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.
   - readdress when more stable
   - hold amytriptilline

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent hospitalizations. The patient was transferred from Hospital3 with right leg edema and weeping on 9/22. He presented as transfer from Hospital1 to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.

The patient has multiple medical complications including:
1. AG Met acidosis: The patient had an AG metabolic acidosis since 9/25 with elevated lactate levels. He was alkalotic previously due to overdiuresis and respiratory alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated lactate, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis are concerning for sepsis. Likely healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS. Cdiff negative x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
2. PUMP: The patient has a low EF of 10% on echo on 9/23, thought to be ischemic in nature. There was recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%), which may be due to new-onset AFib preventing extra cardiac output from atrial kick. He was treated with"
