   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders & alcoholism who presents
   as OSH transfer with acute encephalopathy, jaundice,
   hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding and hypotensive shock requiring
   pressors.
   .
   *
   #GI Bleeding: Likely upper source given coffee ground emesis and known
   prior esophageal varices on EGD in past. LFTs indicate ETOH cirrhosis
   given AST>ALT and given social history this is likely worsened acute on
   chronic cirrhosis. EGD urgently done and patient was found to have
   oozing upper varices x4, the worse was stage III. She has bandeing x 4
   esophageal varices.
   .
   -active T&S
   -q6 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 30 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis); holding steroids given possible sepsis
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: She is status post 3-4L NS IVFs and is currently on
   2 pressors. CVPs in the 14-15 range now. CXR with no signs of fluid
   overload. Etiologies include hypovolemia in setting of dehydration and
   GI losses and FeNa indicated pre-renal status as well. Also need to
   consider septic physiology as she had leukocytosis to 19 at OSH and had
   E.Coli in urine cultures with positive UA.
   .
   - place A-line for close hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue on Levaquin IV , hold off on Flagyl for now and will
   consider expansion to double cover GNRs if spikes fevers
   -f/up urine cultures / blood cultures
   -follow Cv02 saturations; if elevated favors sepsis etiology
   -follow CVP goal >10
   -trend lactates q6-8 hours
   -a.m TTE to assess for any vegetations ( for EF and CMY check as well
   )
   - paracentesis for SBP
   - continue on current pressors with Levophed and Vasopressin
   - wean Vasopressin as tolerates
   - CXR to establish any pulmonary sources for infection & for fluid
   status
   .
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output.
   -additional IVFs
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   -check sediment, urine lytes
   -check UA for ketones
   -f/up urine lytes  & recalculate FeNa
   #Hyponatremia / Hypokalemia: Given eating disorders and albumin at 1.9
   to 2.3 at OSH she likely has malnutrition at baseline. Low sodium
   likely in setting of hypovolemia as well. ARF is also present and may
   be contribnuting to electrolyte shifts.
   - will replete K to >4 to avoid arrhythmias / place on scales
   - will trend Na, continue gentle IVFs
   .
   #Anemia: Hct low in setting of acute GI bleeding and probably has low
   iron, B12 levels in setting of eating disorders. Also may have marrow
   suppression of blood levels secondary to ETOH.
   - trend HCTs q6 hours for now
   - active T&S
   - transfuse to 30 Hct , 1 unit now
   - f/up iron studies, folate, B12
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - will give 1 Unit of platelets (esp given A-line)
   - desmopressin
   - trend coags, platelet levels
   .
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient was very confused at OSH per reports.
   Avoiding versed sedation and giving propofol and fentanyl now. Will
   wean sedation as much as possible.
   -got NAC loading dose 150mg/kg, will continue additional NAC and follow
   LFTs
   .
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   .
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable
   #Leukocytosis: Could be urinary source given her hazy urine with
   positive nitrites and leuks at OSH which are consistent for UTI. Also
   need to consider SBP in setting of her ascites and liver failure.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - send off urine cultures/ repeat UA
   - do diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - f/up OSH R&S data from urine culture

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders and alcoholism who presented to the ICU with acute encephalopathy, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding, and hypotensive shock. She required pressors for hemodynamic support. The patient has ongoing renal failure, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, and thrombocytopenia. She also has anemia and malnutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient likely has upper GI bleeding given the coffee ground emesis and known esophageal varices. There is a risk of rebleeding and further complications such as aspiration or sepsis.
2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is still hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation and pressor support. There is a concern for ongoing hypovolemia, possible septic physiology, and the need for close monitoring of hemodynamic status.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Close monitoring of ABG and electrolytes is necessary. Treatment may include IV bicarbonate if pH falls.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration and hypovolemia. There may also be an element of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of urine output, electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders & alcoholism who presents
   as OSH transfer with acute encephalopathy, jaundice,
   hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding and hypotensive shock requiring
   pressors consistent with fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   #GI Bleeding: Likely upper source given coffee ground emesis and known
   prior esophageal varices on EGD in past. LFTs indicate ETOH cirrhosis
   given AST>ALT and given social history this is likely worsened acute on
   chronic cirrhosis. EGD urgently done and patient was found to have
   oozing upper varices x4, the worse was stage III. She has bandeing x 4
   esophageal varices.
   -active T&S
   -q6 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 30 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis); holding steroids for alcoholic hepatitis given possible
   sepsis
   -lactulose
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: She is status post 3-4L NS IVFs and has been weaned
   off 2 pressors. CVPs in the 14-15 range now. CXR with no signs of fluid
   overload. Etiologies include hypovolemia in setting of dehydration and
   GI losses and FeNa indicated pre-renal status as well. Also need to
   consider septic physiology as she had leukocytosis to 19 at OSH and had
   E.Coli in urine cultures with positive UA.   A-line placed for
   monitoring
   - switch from Levaquin IV (day#2 today) to cipro , hold off on Flagyl
   for now and will consider expansion to double cover GNRs if spikes
   fevers
   -f/up urine cultures / blood cultures
   -follow Cv02 saturations; if elevated favors sepsis etiology
   -follow CVP goal >10
   -trend lactates q6-8 hours
   -a.m TTE to assess for any vegetations ( for EF and CMY check as well
   )
   - paracentesis for SBP
   - CXR to establish any pulmonary sources for infection & for fluid
   status
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now to help with blowing off CO2
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient was very confused at OSH per reports.
   Avoiding versed sedation and giving propofol and fentanyl now. Off
   sedation, still lethargic. No evidence of head bleed. Responds to pain
   stimuli only. Worry about cerebral edema.
   -got NAC loading dose 150mg/kg, will continue additional NAC and follow
   LFTs
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. If does not respond to
   fluids, would have to consider hepatorenal syndrome
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 1^st
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   -check sediment, urine lytes
   -check UA for ketones
   -f/up urine lytes  & recalculate FeNa
   #Hyponatremia / Hypokalemia: Given eating disorders and albumin at 1.9
   to 2.3 at OSH she likely has malnutrition at baseline. Low sodium
   likely in setting of hypovolemia as well. ARF is also present and may
   be contribnuting to electrolyte shifts.
   - will replete K to >4 to avoid arrhythmias / place on scales
   - will trend Na, continue gentle IVFs
   .
   #Anemia: Hct low in setting of acute GI bleeding and probably has low
   iron, B12 levels in setting of eating disorders. Also may have marrow
   suppression of blood levels secondary to ETOH.
   - trend HCTs q6 hours for now
   - active T&S
   - transfuse to 26 Hct , 1 unit now
   - f/up iron studies, folate, B12
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - desmopressin
   - trend coags, platelet levels
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   .
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable
   #Leukocytosis: Could be urinary source given her hazy urine with
   positive nitrites and leuks at OSH which are consistent for UTI. Also
   need to consider SBP in setting of her ascites and liver failure.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - send off urine cultures/ repeat UA
   - do diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - f/up OSH R&S data from urine culture

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders and alcoholism. She was transferred to the ICU with acute encephalopathy, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding, and hypotensive shock. The patient has been diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure, likely secondary to alcohol use, possible tylenol overdose, infection, or hypotension. She also has evidence of pre-renal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis. The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to the elevated lactate and acute renal failure. She has an anion gap of 18-20 range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream that the liver is unable to filter out.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible acute kidney injury, which can be caused by hypovolemia, pre-renal azotemia, or intrinsic renal damage.
3. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, positive urine culture for E. coli, and hazy urine with positive nitrites and leukocytes suggest a possible urinary tract infection. Additionally, the presence of ascites and liver failure raises concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
4. GI bleeding: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders & alcoholism who presents
   as OSH transfer with acute encephalopathy, jaundice,
   hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding and hypotensive shock requiring
   pressors.
   .
   *
   #GI Bleeding: Likely upper source given coffee ground emesis and known
   prior esophageal varices on EGD in past. LFTs indicate ETOH cirrhosis
   given AST>ALT and given social history this is likely worsened acute on
   chronic cirrhosis. EGD urgently done and patient was found to have
   oozing upper varices x4, the worse was stage III. She has bandeing x 4
   esophageal varices.
   .
   -active T&S
   -q6 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 30 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis); holding steroids given possible sepsis
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: She is status post 3-4L NS IVFs and is currently on
   2 pressors. CVPs in the 14-15 range now. CXR with no signs of fluid
   overload. Etiologies include hypovolemia in setting of dehydration and
   GI losses and FeNa indicated pre-renal status as well. Also need to
   consider septic physiology as she had leukocytosis to 19 at OSH and had
   E.Coli in urine cultures with positive UA.
   .
   - place A-line for close hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue on Levaquin IV , hold off on Flagyl for now and will
   consider expansion to double cover GNRs if spikes fevers
   -f/up urine cultures / blood cultures
   -follow Cv02 saturations; if elevated favors sepsis etiology
   -follow CVP goal >10
   -trend lactates q6-8 hours
   -a.m TTE to assess for any vegetations ( for EF and CMY check as well
   )
   - paracentesis for SBP
   - continue on current pressors with Levophed and Vasopressin
   - wean Vasopressin as tolerates
   - CXR to establish any pulmonary sources for infection & for fluid
   status
   .
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output.
   -additional IVFs
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   -check sediment, urine lytes
   -check UA for ketones
   -f/up urine lytes  & recalculate FeNa
   #Hyponatremia / Hypokalemia: Given eating disorders and albumin at 1.9
   to 2.3 at OSH she likely has malnutrition at baseline. Low sodium
   likely in setting of hypovolemia as well. ARF is also present and may
   be contribnuting to electrolyte shifts.
   - will replete K to >4 to avoid arrhythmias / place on scales
   - will trend Na, continue gentle IVFs
   .
   #Anemia: Hct low in setting of acute GI bleeding and probably has low
   iron, B12 levels in setting of eating disorders. Also may have marrow
   suppression of blood levels secondary to ETOH.
   - trend HCTs q6 hours for now
   - active T&S
   - transfuse to 30 Hct , 1 unit now
   - f/up iron studies, folate, B12
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - will give 1 Unit of platelets (esp given A-line)
   - desmopressin
   - trend coags, platelet levels
   .
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient was very confused at OSH per reports.
   Avoiding versed sedation and giving propofol and fentanyl now. Will
   wean sedation as much as possible.
   -got NAC loading dose 150mg/kg, will continue additional NAC and follow
   LFTs
   .
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   .
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable
   #Leukocytosis: Could be urinary source given her hazy urine with
   positive nitrites and leuks at OSH which are consistent for UTI. Also
   need to consider SBP in setting of her ascites and liver failure.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - send off urine cultures/ repeat UA
   - do diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - f/up OSH R&S data from urine culture

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders and alcoholism. She was admitted to the ICU for acute encephalopathy, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding, and hypotensive shock requiring pressors. The patient has been on vasopressin and is now only on vasopressin after being weaned off levophed. Her creatinine level is at 4, indicating renal failure. The anion gap is still not closing, and bicarbonate levels are falling. The patient has been diagnosed with oozing esophageal varices, which were banded, as well as gastric varices. Her hemoglobin level is low but stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleeding: The patient has upper GI bleeding, likely from esophageal varices. She has banding of the esophageal varices, but there is a risk of rebleeding or further complications.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and shock, possibly due to hypovolemia from dehydration and GI losses, pre-renal azotemia, or septic physiology. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and fluid balance is crucial.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to elevated lactate and acute renal failure. The anion gap is elevated, indicating an underlying cause such as lactic acidosis or keto"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders & alcoholism who presents
   as OSH transfer with acute encephalopathy, jaundice,
   hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding and hypotensive shock requiring
   pressors consistent with fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   #GI Bleeding: Likely upper source given coffee ground emesis and known
   prior esophageal varices on EGD in past. LFTs indicate ETOH cirrhosis
   given AST>ALT and given social history this is likely worsened acute on
   chronic cirrhosis. EGD urgently done and patient was found to have
   oozing upper varices x4, the worse was stage III. She has bandeing x 4
   esophageal varices.
   -active T&S
   -q6 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 30 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis); holding steroids for alcoholic hepatitis given possible
   sepsis
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: She is status post 3-4L NS IVFs and has been weaned
   off 2 pressors. CVPs in the 14-15 range now. CXR with no signs of fluid
   overload. Etiologies include hypovolemia in setting of dehydration and
   GI losses and FeNa indicated pre-renal status as well. Also need to
   consider septic physiology as she had leukocytosis to 19 at OSH and had
   E.Coli in urine cultures with positive UA.   A-line placed for
   monitoring
   - switch from Levaquin IV (day#2 today) to cipro , hold off on Flagyl
   for now and will consider expansion to double cover GNRs if spikes
   fevers
   -f/up urine cultures / blood cultures
   -follow Cv02 saturations; if elevated favors sepsis etiology
   -follow CVP goal >10
   -trend lactates q6-8 hours
   -a.m TTE to assess for any vegetations ( for EF and CMY check as well
   )
   - paracentesis for SBP
   - CXR to establish any pulmonary sources for infection & for fluid
   status
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now to help with blowing off CO2
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient was very confused at OSH per reports.
   Avoiding versed sedation and giving propofol and fentanyl now. Off
   sedation, still lethargic. No evidence of head bleed. Responds to pain
   stimuli only. Worry about cerebral edema.
   -got NAC loading dose 150mg/kg, will continue additional NAC and follow
   LFTs
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. If does not respond to
   fluids, would have to consider hepatorenal syndrome
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 1^st
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   -check sediment, urine lytes
   -check UA for ketones
   -f/up urine lytes  & recalculate FeNa
   #Hyponatremia / Hypokalemia: Given eating disorders and albumin at 1.9
   to 2.3 at OSH she likely has malnutrition at baseline. Low sodium
   likely in setting of hypovolemia as well. ARF is also present and may
   be contribnuting to electrolyte shifts.
   - will replete K to >4 to avoid arrhythmias / place on scales
   - will trend Na, continue gentle IVFs
   .
   #Anemia: Hct low in setting of acute GI bleeding and probably has low
   iron, B12 levels in setting of eating disorders. Also may have marrow
   suppression of blood levels secondary to ETOH.
   - trend HCTs q6 hours for now
   - active T&S
   - transfuse to 26 Hct , 1 unit now
   - f/up iron studies, folate, B12
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - desmopressin
   - trend coags, platelet levels
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   .
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable
   #Leukocytosis: Could be urinary source given her hazy urine with
   positive nitrites and leuks at OSH which are consistent for UTI. Also
   need to consider SBP in setting of her ascites and liver failure.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - send off urine cultures/ repeat UA
   - do diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - f/up OSH R&S data from urine culture

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders and alcoholism. She presents with acute encephalopathy, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding, and hypotensive shock requiring pressors. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has signs of hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. The patient also has a history of anorexia/bulimia and is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient shows signs of confusion and lethargy, which can be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring neurologic status and following lactate levels are important for managing this condition.
2. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, and hyperbilirubinemia indicate liver failure. Continued treatment for liver failure is necessary, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration and further hepatitis studies.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a high anion gap and compensated respiratory alkalosis. Close monitoring of ABG, electrolytes, and lactate levels is required. If pH falls, IV bicarbonate may be given to correct metabolic acidosis.
4. Acute renal failure"

   45 yo F history of ETOH cirrhosis, anorexia, agoraphobia presents with
   fulminant liver failure, likely [**1-5**] etoh abuse but ruling out
   infection, tylenol overdose (likely chronic abuse) vs other toxic
   ingestion including ethanol/methanol, infectious sources; complicated
   by encephaolopathy, GIB and respiratrory failure
   1. gastrointestingal bleed:  now s/p endoscopy with banding of varices,
   currently no active s/sx of bleed
    - cont [**Hospital1 **] PPI, octreotide
    - will transfuse for s/sx bleed or hct < 26
    - q 6 hour hct checks
    - FFP to maintain INR < 1.5 if bleeding
   2. Liver failure: etoh +/- tylenol +/- infection, will also r/u
   autoimmune, infectious sources, hemochromatois
     - cont NAC for possible tylenol overuse
    - tox screen
    - f/u culture data although given overall rapid improvement in
   hemodynamics, infection seems less likely etiology and will start
   ciprofloxacin for possible UTI
    - f/u autoimmune studies
    - f/u HBV, HCV serologies
   - will start methylprednisonefor etoh hepatis.
   3.   Hypotension: dehydration, low intravascular oncotic pressure, less
   likely sepsis/infection given rapid improvement
     - off pressors, may be related to dehydration
    - CVP > 8
    - trending lactate,
   4. Metabolic acidosis: renal and liver failure with pH > 7.25
    - renal servuce following
    - check serum osms for osm gap to r/o ethanol
   5. ARF: ikely pre-renal but may also be hepatorenal
    - following serum and urine electrolytes
    - renal service following
    - will give fluid challenge and albumin and assess creatinine response
   to assess for HRS
    - spin urine
   6. thrombocytopenia: t/f to maintain platelets > 30
   7. mental status: she has no focal neurologic deficits but given her
   degree of encephalopathy is at increased risk for cerebral edema
    - q 2hr neuro checks
   8. Respiratory failure: intubated for mental status changes, remains
   intubated to allow her to maintain normal pH
    - will continue vent support for now, will try swithc to PSV

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, anorexia, and agoraphobia. She presents with fulminant liver failure, likely due to chronic ETOH abuse, but ruling out infection, Tylenol overdose, or other toxic ingestions. She also has encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an endoscopy with banding of esophageal varices and is currently not showing active signs of bleeding. She is being treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and octreotide for GIB, and will receive blood transfusions if there are signs of bleeding or if her hematocrit (hct) drops below 26. Her hct will be checked every 6 hours. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be given to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR) below 1.5 if there is bleeding.

The patient's liver failure is due to ETOH abuse, possibly in combination with Tylenol overdose or infection. Further investigations will be done to rule out autoimmune causes, infectious sources, and other etiologies. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) will be continued for possible Tylenol overuse, and a toxic screen will be performed. Cultures will be followed up, and serologies for autoimmune diseases, hepatitis B and C, will be obtained. Methylpred"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F history of ETOH cirrhosis, anorexia, agoraphobia presents with
   fulminant liver failure, likely [**1-5**] etoh abuse but ruling out
   infection, tylenol overdose (likely chronic abuse) vs other toxic
   ingestion including ethanol/methanol, infectious sources; complicated
   by encephaolopathy, GIB and respiratrory failure
   1. gastrointestingal bleed:  now s/p endoscopy with banding of varices,
   currently no active s/sx of bleed
    - cont [**Hospital1 **] PPI, octreotide
    - will transfuse for s/sx bleed or hct < 26
    - q 6 hour hct checks
    - FFP to maintain INR < 1.5 if bleeding
   2. Liver failure: etoh +/- tylenol +/- infection, will also r/u
   autoimmune, infectious sources, hemochromatois
     - cont NAC for possible tylenol overuse
    - tox screen
    - f/u culture data although given overall rapid improvement in
   hemodynamics, infection seems less likely etiology and will start
   ciprofloxacin for possible UTI
    - f/u autoimmune studies
    - f/u HBV, HCV serologies
   - will start methylprednisonefor etoh hepatis.
   3.   Hypotension: dehydration, low intravascular oncotic pressure, less
   likely sepsis/infection given rapid improvement
     - off pressors, may be related to dehydration
    - CVP > 8
    - trending lactate,
   4. Metabolic acidosis: renal and liver failure with pH > 7.25
    - renal servuce following;  IVF with NaHCO3
    - check serum osms for osm gap to r/o ethanol
   5. ARF: ikely pre-renal but may also be hepatorenal
    - following serum and urine electrolytes
    - renal service following
    - will give fluid challenge and albumin and assess creatinine response
   to assess for HRS
    - spin urine
   6. thrombocytopenia: t/f to maintain platelets > 30
   7. mental status: she has no focal neurologic deficits but given her
   degree of encephalopathy is at increased risk for cerebral edema
    - q 2hr neuro checks
   8. Respiratory failure: intubated for mental status changes, remains
   intubated to allow her to maintain normal pH
    - will continue vent support for now, will try switch to PSV
    9. ETOH: thiamine, folate, mvi

   Total time spent: 90 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. She presented with altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was admitted to the ICU and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding of esophageal varices. The patient's condition has improved, but she remains critically ill with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient had a GIB, which was managed with endoscopic banding of esophageal varices. She will continue on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and octreotide therapy. Blood transfusion will be given if there are signs of bleeding or if hemoglobin concentration (Hct) falls below 26.
2. Liver failure: The patient has evidence of fulminant liver failure, likely due to alcohol abuse, possible tylenol overdose, or infection. Further evaluation is needed to rule out autoimmune causes, hemochromatosis, and other infectious sources. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) will be continued for possible tylenol overuse, and a toxicology screen will be performed. cultures and gram stain from paracentesis will be followed up.
3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which may be due to dehydration or low intravascular oncotic pressure. Pressors have been weaned off, and CVP should be maintained above 8.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to renal and liver failure. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) will be given intravenously to correct the pH.
5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient may have pre-renal or hepatorenal ARF. Serum and urine electrolytes will be followed, and a fluid challenge with albumin will be given to assess for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, and platelet transfusion will be given to maintain platelets above 30.
7. Mental status: The patient's mental status is altered due to encephalopathy. Neurologic checks will be done every 2 hours, and she will be monitored for signs of cerebral edema.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated to maintain normal pH and will continue ventilatory support. A trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) will be attempted.
9. Ethanol abuse: The patient will receive thiamine, folate, and multivitamin supplementation to address potential deficiencies related to chronic alcohol abuse.

Overall, the patient requires critical care management for her multiple medical complications."

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. She has undergone endoscopy with banding of esophageal varices, but continuous monitoring is required to detect any signs of re-bleeding.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised due to alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to mental status changes. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an ongoing metabolic acidosis, likely due to liver"

   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension. Patient also with discriminant function>32, on
   steroids for alcoholic hepatitis
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   - continue steroids (d#2
 IV solumedrol)
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis)
   -place dophoff in IR
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient on some propofol, getting Q1hr neuro
   checks. In last 2 hours, having more posturing on left this AM
   concerning for cerebral edema since last CT head last night
 none on
   prelim review of CT.
   - f/u final CT head read
   - dophoff placement for lactulose/rifax
   - continue NAC
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #GI Bleeding: s/p banding of esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or
   melena overnight. Received one pRBC overnight for decreasing Hct
   -active T&S
   -q8 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 25 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
 ends this afternoon
   - continue protonix
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:
   BP now improved, off pressors. Suspected hypovolemia, possible
   urosepsis. Para negative for SBP.
   - Continue cipro d3 for now pending sensitivities
   - F/u OSH micro
   - Continue to trend lactates
   - F/u micro and CIS
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now help compensate for metabolic acidosis
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. Has shown response to
   albumin
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 2^nd
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and shock. She is currently off pressors and intubated for airway protection with encephalopathy. The patient has been treated with solumedrol steroids for alcoholic hepatitis and given albumin challenge for renal failure. She is also on octreotide and propofol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fulminant liver failure: The patient's known ETOH cirrhosis may have led to this condition, possibly due to increased alcohol consumption, Tylenol use/overdose, infection, or hypotension. She has a discriminant function >32 and is on steroids for alcoholic hepatitis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is showing more posturing on the left, which could be concerning for cerebral edema since the last CT head last night, which was preliminary reviewed as normal. She is on propofol and getting Q1hr neuro checks.
3. GI bleeding: The patient underwent banding of esophageal varices and received one unit of packed red blood cells overnight for decreasing hematocrit. She is being monitored for any signs of hematemesis or melena.
4. Hypotension/shock: The patient's blood pressure has improved and she is off pressors. She is suspected to have hypovolem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has a history of gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 110/48 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 86-87%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4433 mL and output of 809 mL, resulting in a balance of 3624 mL. The patient has received multiple infusions, including octreotide and propofol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum cultures is necessary to detect any signs of infection.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders & alcoholism who presents
   as OSH transfer with acute encephalopathy, jaundice,
   hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding and hypotensive shock requiring
   pressors consistent with fulminant hepatic failure.
   .
   #GI Bleeding: Likely upper source given coffee ground emesis and known
   prior esophageal varices on EGD in past. LFTs indicate ETOH cirrhosis
   given AST>ALT and given social history this is likely worsened acute on
   chronic cirrhosis. EGD urgently done and patient was found to have
   oozing upper varices x4, the worse was stage III. She has bandeing x 4
   esophageal varices.
   -active T&S
   -q6 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 30 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis); holding steroids for alcoholic hepatitis given possible
   sepsis
   -lactulose
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: She is status post 3-4L NS IVFs and has been weaned
   off 2 pressors. CVPs in the 14-15 range now. CXR with no signs of fluid
   overload. Etiologies include hypovolemia in setting of dehydration and
   GI losses and FeNa indicated pre-renal status as well. Also need to
   consider septic physiology as she had leukocytosis to 19 at OSH and had
   E.Coli in urine cultures with positive UA.   A-line placed for
   monitoring
   - switch from Levaquin IV (day#2 today) to cipro , hold off on Flagyl
   for now and will consider expansion to double cover GNRs if spikes
   fevers
   -f/up urine cultures / blood cultures
   -follow Cv02 saturations; if elevated favors sepsis etiology
   -follow CVP goal >10
   -trend lactates q6-8 hours
   -a.m TTE to assess for any vegetations ( for EF and CMY check as well
   )
   - paracentesis for SBP
   - CXR to establish any pulmonary sources for infection & for fluid
   status
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now to help with blowing off CO2
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient was very confused at OSH per reports.
   Avoiding versed sedation and giving propofol and fentanyl now. Off
   sedation, still lethargic. No evidence of head bleed. Responds to pain
   stimuli only. Worry about cerebral edema.
   -got NAC loading dose 150mg/kg, will continue additional NAC and follow
   LFTs
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. If does not respond to
   fluids, would have to consider hepatorenal syndrome
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 1^st
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   -check sediment, urine lytes
   -check UA for ketones
   -f/up urine lytes  & recalculate FeNa
   #Hyponatremia / Hypokalemia: Given eating disorders and albumin at 1.9
   to 2.3 at OSH she likely has malnutrition at baseline. Low sodium
   likely in setting of hypovolemia as well. ARF is also present and may
   be contribnuting to electrolyte shifts.
   - will replete K to >4 to avoid arrhythmias / place on scales
   - will trend Na, continue gentle IVFs
   .
   #Anemia: Hct low in setting of acute GI bleeding and probably has low
   iron, B12 levels in setting of eating disorders. Also may have marrow
   suppression of blood levels secondary to ETOH.
   - trend HCTs q6 hours for now
   - active T&S
   - transfuse to 26 Hct , 1 unit now
   - f/up iron studies, folate, B12
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - desmopressin
   - trend coags, platelet levels
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   .
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable
   #Leukocytosis: Could be urinary source given her hazy urine with
   positive nitrites and leuks at OSH which are consistent for UTI. Also
   need to consider SBP in setting of her ascites and liver failure.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - send off urine cultures/ repeat UA
   - do diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - f/up OSH R&S data from urine culture

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders and alcoholism. She was admitted to the ICU with acute encephalopathy, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, GI bleeding, and hypotensive shock. The patient has been diagnosed with fulminant liver failure, possibly caused by increased alcohol consumption, tylenol use/overdose, infection, or hypotension. Other medical complications include mechanical ventilation, hepatic encephalopathy, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fulminant liver failure: The patient's known ETOH cirrhosis and possible precipitating factors such as increased alcohol drinking, tylenol use/overdose, infection, or hypotension may lead to worsening liver function and complications.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and lethargy could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and urine output indicate pre-renal dehydration effects and hypovolemia, potentially leading to acute renal failure. Additionally, hepatorenal syndrome should be considered.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock now off
   pressors.
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension. Patient also with discriminant function>32, on
   steroids for alcoholic hepatitis
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   - continue steroids (d#2
 IV solumedrol)
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis); holding steroids for alcoholic hepatitis given possible
   sepsis
   -lactulose
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient on some propofol, getting Q1hr neuro
   checks. In last 2 hours, having more posturing on left this AM
   concerning for cerebral edema since last CT head last night
   - repeat head CT this AM
   - continue NAC
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #GI Bleeding: s/p banding of esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or
   melena overnight. Received one pRBC overnight for decreasing Hct
   -active T&S
   -q6 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 25 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: She is status post 3-4L NS IVFs and has been weaned
   off 2 pressors. CVPs in the 14-15 range now. CXR with no signs of fluid
   overload. Etiologies include hypovolemia in setting of dehydration and
   GI losses and FeNa indicated pre-renal status as well. Also need to
   consider septic physiology as she had leukocytosis to 19 at OSH and had
   E.Coli in urine cultures with positive UA.   A-line placed for
   monitoring
   - switch from Levaquin IV (day#2 today) to cipro , hold off on Flagyl
   for now and will consider expansion to double cover GNRs if spikes
   fevers
   -f/up urine cultures / blood cultures
   -follow Cv02 saturations; if elevated favors sepsis etiology
   -follow CVP goal >10
   -trend lactates q6-8 hours
   -a.m TTE to assess for any vegetations ( for EF and CMY check as well
   )
   - paracentesis for SBP
   - CXR to establish any pulmonary sources for infection & for fluid
   status
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now to help with blowing off CO2
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. If does not respond to
   fluids, would have to consider hepatorenal syndrome
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 1^st
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   -check sediment, urine lytes
   -check UA for ketones
   -f/up urine lytes  & recalculate FeNa
   #Hyponatremia / Hypokalemia: Given eating disorders and albumin at 1.9
   to 2.3 at OSH she likely has malnutrition at baseline. Low sodium
   likely in setting of hypovolemia as well. ARF is also present and may
   be contribnuting to electrolyte shifts.
   - will replete K to >4 to avoid arrhythmias / place on scales
   - will trend Na, continue gentle IVFs
   .
   #Anemia: Hct low in setting of acute GI bleeding and probably has low
   iron, B12 levels in setting of eating disorders. Also may have marrow
   suppression of blood levels secondary to ETOH.
   - trend HCTs q6 hours for now
   - active T&S
   - transfuse to 26 Hct , 1 unit now
   - f/up iron studies, folate, B12
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - desmopressin
   - trend coags, platelet levels
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   .
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable
   #Leukocytosis: Could be urinary source given her hazy urine with
   positive nitrites and leuks at OSH which are consistent for UTI. Also
   need to consider SBP in setting of her ascites and liver failure.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - send off urine cultures/ repeat UA
   - do diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - f/up OSH R&S data from urine culture

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, alcoholic hepatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and shock. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to metabolic acidosis and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been diagnosed with fulminant liver failure, possibly secondary to increased alcohol consumption, tylenol use/overdose, infection, or hypotension. She also has esophageal varices that have been banded. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, likely due to dehydration, GI losses, and pre-renal status as well as septic physiology indicated by leukocytosis and positive urine cultures for E. coli. Other complications include metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of anorexia/bulimia. The patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple organ dysfunction syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock now off
   pressors.
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension. Patient also with discriminant function>32, on
   steroids for alcoholic hepatitis
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   - continue steroids (d#2
 IV solumedrol)
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis); holding steroids for alcoholic hepatitis given possible
   sepsis
   -lactulose
   #GI Bleeding: s/p banding of esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or
   melena overnight. Received one pRBC overnight for decreasing Hct
   -active T&S
   -q6 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 25 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: She is status post 3-4L NS IVFs and has been weaned
   off 2 pressors. CVPs in the 14-15 range now. CXR with no signs of fluid
   overload. Etiologies include hypovolemia in setting of dehydration and
   GI losses and FeNa indicated pre-renal status as well. Also need to
   consider septic physiology as she had leukocytosis to 19 at OSH and had
   E.Coli in urine cultures with positive UA.   A-line placed for
   monitoring
   - switch from Levaquin IV (day#2 today) to cipro , hold off on Flagyl
   for now and will consider expansion to double cover GNRs if spikes
   fevers
   -f/up urine cultures / blood cultures
   -follow Cv02 saturations; if elevated favors sepsis etiology
   -follow CVP goal >10
   -trend lactates q6-8 hours
   -a.m TTE to assess for any vegetations ( for EF and CMY check as well
   )
   - paracentesis for SBP
   - CXR to establish any pulmonary sources for infection & for fluid
   status
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now to help with blowing off CO2
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient was very confused at OSH per reports.
   Avoiding versed sedation and giving propofol and fentanyl now. Off
   sedation, still lethargic. No evidence of head bleed. Responds to pain
   stimuli only. Worry about cerebral edema.
   -got NAC loading dose 150mg/kg, will continue additional NAC and follow
   LFTs
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. If does not respond to
   fluids, would have to consider hepatorenal syndrome
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 1^st
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   -check sediment, urine lytes
   -check UA for ketones
   -f/up urine lytes  & recalculate FeNa
   #Hyponatremia / Hypokalemia: Given eating disorders and albumin at 1.9
   to 2.3 at OSH she likely has malnutrition at baseline. Low sodium
   likely in setting of hypovolemia as well. ARF is also present and may
   be contribnuting to electrolyte shifts.
   - will replete K to >4 to avoid arrhythmias / place on scales
   - will trend Na, continue gentle IVFs
   .
   #Anemia: Hct low in setting of acute GI bleeding and probably has low
   iron, B12 levels in setting of eating disorders. Also may have marrow
   suppression of blood levels secondary to ETOH.
   - trend HCTs q6 hours for now
   - active T&S
   - transfuse to 26 Hct , 1 unit now
   - f/up iron studies, folate, B12
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - desmopressin
   - trend coags, platelet levels
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   .
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable
   #Leukocytosis: Could be urinary source given her hazy urine with
   positive nitrites and leuks at OSH which are consistent for UTI. Also
   need to consider SBP in setting of her ascites and liver failure.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - send off urine cultures/ repeat UA
   - do diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - f/up OSH R&S data from urine culture

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock. She was admitted with confusion, hypotension, and encephalopathy. The patient underwent banding of esophageal varices, received 3 amps of bicarb in fluid overnight, and had a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) without vegetations, ventricular or wall motion abnormalities.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 110/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral icterus, pupils 3->2 bilaterally, mild bibasilar crackles, regular heart sounds, soft abdomen with slightly hypoactive bowel sounds, splenomegaly, and warm extremities with 2+ pedal pulses.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 59, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 45/69), hypoalbuminemia (Albumin: 3.2 g/dL), elevated total bilir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, anorexia, and altered mental status. She was transferred from another hospital with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding of grade III esophageal varices. The patient has developed several complications, including fulminant liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension/shock, and metabolic acidosis. She also has acute renal failure and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fulminant liver failure: The patient's liver failure may progress further, leading to hepatic coma or multiorgan failure.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, resulting in deep coma or other neurological complications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current bleeding, leading to hypovolemic shock.
4. Hypotension/shock: The patient's blood pressure may continue to be unstable, causing inadequate perfusion to vital organs.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance may deteriorate, leading to severe acidosis and its associated complications.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function may worsen, resulting in oliguria or anuria, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
7. Infections: Due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock now off
   pressors.
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension. Patient also with discriminant function>32, on
   steroids for alcoholic hepatitis
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   - continue steroids (d#2
 IV solumedrol)
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis)
   -place dophoff in IR
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient on some propofol, getting Q1hr neuro
   checks. In last 2 hours, having more posturing on left this AM
   concerning for cerebral edema since last CT head last night
 none on
   prelim review of CT.
   - f/u final CT head read
   - dophoff placement for lactulose/rifax
   - continue NAC
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #GI Bleeding: s/p banding of esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or
   melena overnight. Received one pRBC overnight for decreasing Hct
   -active T&S
   -q8 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 25 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
 ends this afternoon
   - continue protonix
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:
   BP now improved, off pressors. Suspected hypovolemia, possible
   urosepsis. Para negative for SBP.
   - Continue cipro d3 for now pending sensitivities
   - F/u OSH micro
   - Continue to trend lactates
   - F/u micro and CIS
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now help compensate for metabolic acidosis
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. Has shown response to
   albumin
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 2^nd
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, alcohol cirrhosis, who presented with fulminant alcoholic liver failure, upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and continues to be intubated for airway protection. The patient is currently off pressors and has improved blood pressure. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, GI bleeding, hypotension/shock, mechanical ventilation, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and a history of anorexia/bulimia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is showing signs of increased posturing on the left side, which could be a concerning sign for cerebral edema. Close monitoring of neuro checks and pupil checks is necessary.

2. GI bleeding: The patient underwent banding of esophageal varices and received one packed red blood cell (pRBC) overnight due to decreasing hematocrit (Hct). Active tracking of trends in Hct and ongoing treatment with octreotide are required.

3. Hypotension/shock: The patient's blood pressure has improved and she is off pressors. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hypotension, possible urosepsis, and negative para for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Continued monitoring of lactates and follow-up with OSH micro and CIS are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock
   .
   # Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Patient also with discriminant function>32 but given GI bleeding
   (likely from esophageal varices noted on EGD), steroids being held now.
   Total bilirubin continues to be elevated near 31 and INR still elevated
   at 2.   MELD is 40 today.
   - continue pentoxyphylline, off steroids.
   - liver recs appreciated
   - dophoff  for tubefeeds
   - continue lactulose / rifax
   - continue Cipro d3, plan 5d course
   - trending LFTs, INR & Hcts q8hrs
   - she is s/p NAC loading for question of Tylenol ingestion
   - f/up additional hepatitis studies, ceruloplasmin,  as well as SMA &
   IGG for full hepatitis workup
   #Hepatic encephalopathy:
   Now on lactulose and rifaximin, appears more awake. No evidence of
   cerebral edema on CT hed.
   - f/u final CT head read
   - consider MRI once stabilized
   -  Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks off sedation
   - if clonic motions or posturing continues consider EEG
   #GI Bleeding: s/p banding of esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or
   melena overnight.  Blood pressures remained stable off of pressors.
   -keep active T&S
   - q8 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 25 Hct
   - s/p 3 days of octreotide drip which ended [**3-18**]
   - continue protonix IV BID
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:
   BP now improved, off pressors. Suspected hypovolemia, possible
   urosepsis. Para negative for SBP.
   - complete 5d course of cipro as above
   - F/u OSH micro data for recent UTI , CIS
   - Continue to trend lactates
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH for airway protection
   with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary process. Still
   needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis and also in
   context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now on A/C to help compensate for metabolic
   acidosis
   - extubated when more awake and reliably following commands
   .
   #Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely related to renal failure and elevated
   lactate.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -renal recs appreciated
   .
   #ARF: Improved with IVF arguing for prerenal component. Likely volume
   deplete [**1-5**] GIB and poor PO. Cr trending down, adequate urine output.
   - continue to trend urine output, Cr
   - check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - SW consult once more stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, alcoholic cirrhosis, and recent hospitalization for fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure, and shock. She has been intubated for airway protection due to encephalopathy. Her condition includes alcoholic hepatitis with a discriminant function >32, hepatic encephalopathy, GIB that required banding of esophageal varices, hypotension/shock with possible urosepsis, mechanical ventilation for metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), thrombocytopenia, and a history of anorexia/bulimia. The patient's current treatment plan includes pentoxyphylline, lactulose, rifaximin, Cipro D3, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs), INR, and hemoglobin concentration (Hct) every 8 hours. The patient is also on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient may experience recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy due to her underlying liver disease and high MELD score.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock now off
   pressors.
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension. Patient also with discriminant function>32, on
   steroids for alcoholic hepatitis
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   - continue steroids (d#2
 IV solumedrol)
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis)
   -place dophoff in IR
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient on some propofol, getting Q1hr neuro
   checks. In last 2 hours, having more posturing on left this AM
   concerning for cerebral edema since last CT head last night
 none on
   prelim review of CT.
   - f/u final CT head read
   - dophoff placement for lactulose/rifax
   - continue NAC
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #GI Bleeding: s/p banding of esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or
   melena overnight. Received one pRBC overnight for decreasing Hct
   -active T&S
   -q8 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 25 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
 ends this afternoon
   - continue protonix
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:
   BP now improved, off pressors. Suspected hypovolemia, possible
   urosepsis. Para negative for SBP.
   - Continue cipro d3 for now pending sensitivities
   - F/u OSH micro
   - Continue to trend lactates
   - F/u micro and CIS
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now help compensate for metabolic acidosis

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis, who has presented with fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and shock. The patient is currently off pressors, intubated for airway protection due to hepatic encephalopathy, and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is showing signs of cerebral edema as indicated by posturing on the left side. Continuous neuro checks with pupil checks should be performed. A final CT head read is required to assess any changes.

2. GI bleeding: The patient underwent banding of esophageal varices. Active T&S should continue, and the HCT should be trended. The patient should be transfused to maintain a Hct > 25. Octreotide drip should continue until the afternoon, and protonix should be continued.

3. Hypotension/shock: The patient's BP has improved and is off pressors. Possible causes include hypovolemia and urosepsis. Ciprofloxacin should be continued pending sensitivities, and lactates should be trended. Micro and CIS should be followed up.

4. Mechanical ventilation: The patient needs to be kept intubated for help with metabolic acidosis and encephalopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock now off
   pressors.
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension. Patient also with discriminant function>32, on
   steroids for alcoholic hepatitis
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   - continue steroids (d#2
 IV solumedrol)
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis)
   -place dophoff in IR
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient on some propofol, getting Q1hr neuro
   checks. In last 2 hours, having more posturing on left this AM
   concerning for cerebral edema since last CT head last night
 none on
   prelim review of CT.
   - f/u final CT head read
   - dophoff placement for lactulose/rifax
   - continue NAC
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #GI Bleeding: s/p banding of esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or
   melena overnight. Received one pRBC overnight for decreasing Hct
   -active T&S
   -q8 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 25 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
 ends this afternoon
   - continue protonix
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:
   BP now improved, off pressors. Suspected hypovolemia, possible
   urosepsis. Para negative for SBP.
   - Continue cipro d3 for now pending sensitivities
   - F/u OSH micro
   - Continue to trend lactates
   - F/u micro and CIS
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now help compensate for metabolic acidosis
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. Has shown response to
   albumin
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 2^nd
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, alcohol cirrhosis, and previous admissions for gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and shock. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, GI bleeding, hypotension/shock, mechanical ventilation, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fulminant liver failure: The patient has known alcohol cirrhosis and possible precipitants such as increased alcohol drinking, Tylenol use/overdose, infection, or hypotension. She has a discriminant function >32 and is on steroids for alcoholic hepatitis. Close monitoring of liver function tests and consideration for additional studies are recommended.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is on propofol and receiving Q1hr neuro checks. There is a concern for cerebral edema, as evidenced by more posturing on the left side. A final CT head should be reviewed, and dophoff placement for lactulose/rifaximin should be considered. Continued N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration and Q2hr neuro checks with pupil checks are also advised.

3. GI bleeding: The patient underwent banding of esophageal varices. No hematemesis or melena was observed overnight, but she received one packed red blood cell ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. He has a history of gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 74 to 96 bpm, blood pressure between 123/55 and 127/65 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16 and 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function test results. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has an arterial line and PICC line in place. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer protection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status and will remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Regular assessment of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary to monitor for this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophyl"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock now off
   pressors.
   .
   # Fulminant liver failure: Known ETOH cirrhosis. Possible ppt with
   increased ETOH drinking vs tylenol use/overdose vs
   infection/hypotension. Patient also with discriminant function>32, on
   steroids for alcoholic hepatitis
   -f/up additional Liver recs, appreciate input
   - continue steroids (d#2
 IV solumedrol)
   -continue NAC in case of tylenol
   -f/up additional hepatitis studies, hemachromatosis, ceruloplasmin,  as
   well as SMA & IGG for full hepatitis workup
   -once stable can give Pentoxifylline PO (decreases inflammation in
   cirrhosis)
   -place dophoff in IR
   #Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient on some propofol, getting Q1hr neuro
   checks. In last 2 hours, having more posturing on left this AM
   concerning for cerebral edema since last CT head last night
 none on
   prelim review of CT.
   - f/u final CT head read
   - dophoff placement for lactulose/rifax
   - continue NAC
   - Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks
   - Continue treatment for liver failure
   #GI Bleeding: s/p banding of esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or
   melena overnight. Received one pRBC overnight for decreasing Hct
   -active T&S
   -q8 hr HCTs, transfuse to > 25 Hct
   -continue octreotide drip
 ends this afternoon
   - continue protonix
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:
   BP now improved, off pressors. Suspected hypovolemia, possible
   urosepsis. Para negative for SBP.
   - Continue cipro d3 for now pending sensitivities
   - F/u OSH micro
   - Continue to trend lactates
   - F/u micro and CIS
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Was intubated at OSH supposedly for airway
   protection with encephalopathy. No evidence of intrinsic pulmonary
   process. Still needs to be intubated for help with metabolic acidosis
   and also in context of encephalopathy
   - keep intubated for now help compensate for metabolic acidosis
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Likely from elevated lactate and acute renal
   failure given Cr 4.4 now. She is compensating with a respiratory
   alkalosis now and pH in 7.33-7.36 range now. Anion Gap 18-20 range.
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -will give IV Bicarbonate if pH falling and AG fails to close
   -renal consult, f/up recs-> aware of patient & will staff in morning
   .
   #ARF: Likely secondary to pre-renal dehydration effects and
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 8**] have element of ATN as well. Not obstructive as no
   signs of hydronephrosis and has urine output. Has shown response to
   albumin
   -albumin challenge and fluids and follow Cr (50 gm x 2 doses)
 2^nd
   dose today
   -monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - repeat EKG
   - SW consult once more stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, alcoholic cirrhosis, and fulminant hepatic failure. She presented with upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding, esophageal and gastric varices, and continues to be intubated for airway protection. The patient also has acute renal failure, shock, hepatic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, and potential complications such as cerebral edema, metabolic acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient shows signs of increased posturing on the left side, which may indicate cerebral edema. It is important to monitor neurologic status and consider further imaging studies like a CT scan to assess for any changes.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap and a pH in the range of 7.33-7.36, indicating metabolic acidosis. Close monitoring of ABG results, electrolytes, and lactate levels is necessary. If the pH falls, IV bicarbonate administration may be required.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 4.0, indicating acute renal failure. This could be secondary to pre-renal dehydration, hypovolemia, or hepatorenal syndrome. Fluid resuscitation, albumin challenge, and careful monitoring of urine output are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, alcoholic cirrhosis, and multiple medical complications including fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure, and shock. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to encephalopathy and active upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been treated with various interventions including banding of esophageal varices, administration of lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, pentoxifylline, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation profile remain abnormal, and she is also experiencing thrombocytopenia and metabolic acidosis. Renal function is improving, but the patient remains dependent on dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is at risk for further episodes of hepatic encephalopathy due to ongoing liver dysfunction and elevated ammonia levels.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding from esophageal varices or other sources, which may require additional interventions such as endoscopic therapy or surgery.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: Despite some improvement in renal function, the patient still requires ongoing renal support, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol cirrhosis presenting with fulminant alcoholic liver failure, upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices, acute renal failure, and shock. She is currently intubated for airway protection and mechanical ventilation due to encephalopathy and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels and prolonged INR indicate ongoing liver dysfunction, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition causes altered mental status and may require treatment with lactulose and rifaximin.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has experienced significant upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from esophageal varices. Banding of the varices has been performed, and she is currently stable. However, close monitoring for signs of recurrent bleeding is necessary.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest acute renal failure, possibly secondary to hypovolemia and pre-renal azotemia. Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid balance are crucial for renal recovery.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is likely due to chronic liver disease and may indicate additional marrow suppression from alcohol use. Close monitoring of platelet levels and transfusion as needed is important to prevent bleeding complications.

5. Metabolic acidosis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis, anorexia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was transferred from OSH with altered mental status and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has several medical conditions and potential complications:

1. Fulminant liver failure: The patient likely has fulminant liver failure due to etoh. A head CT was performed and showed no evidence of edema. She is not a candidate for liver transplantation.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a gradual decrease in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) in the setting of recent GI bleeding. She should be closely monitored for any signs of further bleeding. The plan includes transfusing 1 unit of blood if Hct falls below 25, completing an octreotide drip, continuing intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and administering ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.

3. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's hepatic encephalopathy has shown some improvement. She should continue taking lactulose and rifaximin. Monitoring for signs of etoh withdrawal and treating accordingly is recommended.

4. Renal failure: The patient appears to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN)-related renal failure. Creatinine levels are decreasing, but urine output is not increasing. It is important"

- The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis.
- She was transferred from another hospital with altered mental status and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
- She underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding of grade III esophageal varices.
- The patient is now experiencing multiple medical complications, including fulminant liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, and respiratory failure.
- She is intubated for airway protection and tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 109/49 mmHg and heart rate of 88 bpm.
- She has a distended abdomen, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.
- Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal coagulation profile.
- She has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 45 K/uL.
- She is receiving various medications, including lactulose, rifaximin, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.
- The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management of her multiple organ dysfunctions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatomegaly. She was admitted to the ICU with acute decompensation of her liver disease, including hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and ascites. She also presented with an episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and a positive urine culture for pan-sensitive E. coli.

The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate between 85-109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/56 to 133/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her cardiac rhythm has been in sinus rhythm. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 60.6 kg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,179 mL (549 mL PO, 1,026 mL TF, 1,532 mL IVF) and an output of 2,370 mL (1,180 mL urine, 800 mL NG, 600 mL stool). The overall fluid balance is positive at 809 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Her set tidal volume (Vt) is 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 26 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%. She has a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 34 and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.39, PaCO2 19 mmHg, HCO3- 118 mEq/L, and base excess -10 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals jaundice, dry skin, scleral icterus, mild bibasilar crackles in the lungs, regular heart sounds with no murmurs, soft abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds and splenomegaly, and warm extremities without edema. Neurological examination shows rigid upper extremities and asterixis.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 43 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), hypokalemia with potassium levels of 3.6 mEq/L, hypernatremia with sodium levels of 146 mEq/L, hyponatremia with chloride levels of 25.8 %, hyperglycemia with glucose levels up to 181 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine at 4.1 mg/dL.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, alcoholic cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure, and shock. She has been admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to encephalopathy. The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient meets the criteria for steroid treatment, but due to ongoing GI bleeding, steroids are being held. She is being managed with pentoxifylline and lactulose.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is showing improvement with lactulose and rifaximin. Neurological checks are being done every 2 hours.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient underwent banding of esophageal varices. No further bleeding has been observed, and her blood pressure remains stable.
4. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's blood pressure has improved, and she is off pressors. Possible causes include hypovolemia and urosepsis.
5. Mechanical ventilation: The patient remains intubated for airway protection and assistance with metabolic acidosis.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidosis is likely related to renal failure and elevated lactate. AG trend, electrolytes, Cr, and ABG compensation are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and shock. She is currently in the ICU and has been intubated for airway protection due to encephalopathy. She has several medical complications including alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, GI bleeding, leukocytosis, hypotension/shock, mechanical ventilation, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and a history of anorexia/bulimia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient has an elevated total bilirubin level and an INR of 2.0, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. This condition may progress and lead to further hepatic failure.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is on lactulose and rifaximin for this condition, but there is a risk of recurrence if the liver function does not improve.
3. GI bleeding: Although the patient has been stabilized with banding of esophageal varices, there is a possibility of rebleeding. Close monitoring and ongoing treatment are necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection. This could potentially worsen if not appropriately managed.
5. Hypotension/shock: The patient's blood pressure remains unstable, which can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and shock. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hepatic encephalopathy. She has been treated for various complications including alcoholic hepatitis, GI bleeding, leukocytosis, hypotension/shock, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition has been improving with appropriate interventions, but she still faces multiple medical challenges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient may continue to experience altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction due to severe liver dysfunction.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a risk of recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices or other sources, which could lead to hypotension and shock.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to worsening fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment, there is a risk of secondary infections such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if she experiences any invasive procedures or trauma.
6. Malnutrition: Prolonged enteral nutrition may be necessary to provide adequate calories and nutrients due to her history of eating disorders and chronic liver disease.
7. Pulmonary complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure, and shock. She is currently in the ICU and has been intubated due to airway protection with encephalopathy. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis and is being treated with pentoxifylline. The patient also has mechanical ventilation, hepatic encephalopathy, and GI bleeding. She has leukocytosis and hypotension, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and a history of anorexia/bulimia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has been experiencing encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure. She is currently being treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had an urgent EGD and was found to have esophageal varices. These varices were banded to prevent further bleeding.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can be a result of the liver failure and dehydration. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which may be due to chronic liver disease or additional marrow suppression from alcohol use. Platelet"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F etoh cirrhosis, anorexia, transferred from osh with altered
   mental status and upper GIB, now s/p EGD with banding of grade III
   esophageal varices
    1.) Fulminant liver failure: likely [**1-5**] etoh.  Head CT prelim neg for
   edema.  Not transplant candidate.
   - liver service assistance much appreciated
   - Now on trental for alcoholic hepatitis
   - Continue rifaximin, decrease lactulose for copious stool
   - f/u hepatitis studies, trend LFTs
    2.) GIB:  HCT stable over last 24 hours
   - t/f Hct > 25, s/sx bleed
   - completed octreotide drip [**3-18**]
   - cont iv ppi
   -Cipro for SBP prophylaxis
    3.)  AMS:  Hepatic encephalopathy much improved today
   -Lactulose, rifaximin as above.
   -Currently off sedation.  Will monitor for signs of etoh w/d and treat
   accordlingly.
    4.)  Renal Failure:  Initial ARF seems most c/w ATN.  Creatinine then
   rose yesterday and u/o decreased-->fluid responsive.  Likely now a
   little prerenal due to diarrhea from lactulose.
   -Target positive fluid balance today and monitor u/o.
    5.)  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for airway protection.
   Tolerating SBT thus far, reasonable cough.  Is likely OK to extubate
   despite secretions given her cough.
   -Will extubate today.
   6.) Leukocytosis: In the context of dark sputum, some concern for early
   VAP.  CXR not convincing.  Low grade temp yesterday was in the context
   of warming blanket.
      -Resent sputum sample
      -Empiric renally dosed Vanco, cefep until cultures return.
    7). Access: Has PICC
    8.)  Thrombocytopenia:  Will monitor for active bleeding closely and
   transfuse, use DDAVP as needed.

   Total time spent: 32 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis, anorexia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was transferred from OSH with altered mental status and upper GIB, and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding of grade III esophageal varices.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fulminant liver failure: likely due to etoh. Head CT preliminary negative for edema. Not a transplant candidate.
- Continue trental for alcoholic hepatitis
- Follow up hepatitis studies, trend liver function tests (LFTs)

2. GIB: HCT stable over the last 24 hours
- Transfer Hct > 25, s/sx bleed
- Completed octreotide drip on [**3-18**]
- Continue intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
- Cipro for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis

3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): Hepatic encephalopathy much improved today
- Lactulose and rifaximin as above
- Currently off sedation. Will monitor for signs of etoh withdrawal and treat accordingly

4. Renal Failure: Initial acute renal failure seems most consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine then rose yesterday and urine output decreased --> fluid responsive. Likely now a little pre-renal due to diarrhea from lactul"

   Tolerating SBT thus far, reasonable cough.  Is likely OK to extubate
   despite secretions given her cough.
   -Will extubate today.
   6.) Leukocytosis: In the context of dark sputum, some concern for early
   VAP.  CXR not convincing.  Low grade temp yesterday was in the context
   of warming blanket.
      -Resent sputum sample
      -Empiric renally dosed Vanco, cefep until cultures return.
    7). Access: Has PICC
    8.)  Thrombocytopenia:  Will monitor for active bleeding closely and
   transfuse, use DDAVP as needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis, anorexia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was transferred from OSH with altered mental status and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding of grade III esophageal varices.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Fulminant liver failure: likely due to etoh. A head CT preliminary examination was negative for edema, and the patient is not considered a transplant candidate. She is currently being treated with trental for alcoholic hepatitis, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are being monitored.

2. GIB: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has been stable over the last 24 hours. She has been transfused with blood products to maintain a HCT greater than 25 and prevent symptoms of bleeding. An octreotide drip has been completed, and she is receiving intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Ciprofloxacin is being administered for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.

3. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's hepatic encephalopathy has improved significantly. She is currently off sedation and will continue to be monitored for signs of etoh withdrawal and treated accordingly.

4. Renal failure: The patient initially experienced acute renal failure, which is"

   Assessment and Plan:
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock found to
   have alcoholic hepatitis.
   .
   # Alcoholic hepatitis :  Despite her recent discriminant function>32,
   opted not to treat with any steroids given her marked GI bleeding (
   esophageal varices oozing & banded after EGD on [**3-16**]).  Total bilirubin
   continues to be elevated but has now dipped from 30 to 28 range today.
   INR still elevated at 2. 1 today. All recent  hepatitis studies,
   ceruloplasmin, SMA & IGG all negative for any alternative hepatitis
   causes and social history of recent heavy ETOH use most consistent with
   alcoholic hepatitis.
   - start nadolol today with hold parameters
   - continue pentoxyphylline, holding off on steroids for now
   -  f/up liver recs
   - continue lactulose / rifaxamin
   - continue last day of Cipro ( day 5 of  5 )
   - trending Hcts  [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue MVI, thiamine, daily folate
   - SW consult when more stable
   #Hepatic encephalopathy:  Now on lactulose and rifaximin, appears more
   awake after extubation. No evidence of cerebral edema on recent CT
   head. No additional questionable clonic motions or posturing overnight.
   -  consider MRI once stabilized given note of right orbital nonspecific
   finding on CT
   -  [**Hospital1 **]  neuro checks at this point
   - continue lactulose
   #GI Bleeding:  She had urgent EGD on arrival and is now s/p banding of
   esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or melena overnight.  Blood
   pressures still continue to remain stable off of pressors.
   - keep active T&S
   - can switch to [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks now , transfuse to > 25 Hct
   - s/p 3 days of octreotide drip which ended [**3-18**]
   - continue protonix IV BID
   #Leukocytosis:  Still no fever spikes despite WBC climb up to 20 range
   today. No evidence of active respiratory infection.  CXR with opacity
   on right. Otherwise, as above, her workup was negative for SBP.  Should
   have adequate coverage for her UTI as OSH micro data showed
   pan-sensitive E.Coli. Sputum cx mixed bacteria.
   - discontinue vanc/cefepime today
   - follow for fevers / WBC trend
   - continue Cipro
   - repeat blood cultures if spikes
   - consider repeat sputum cultures
   .. .
   #Metabolic Acidosis:  Continues to improve. Likely related to renal
   failure and elevated lactate. Anion Gap coming down to 15-range now (
   from 20s) .
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -renal recs appreciated
   .
   #ARF: Improved with IVF arguing for prerenal component. Likely volume
   deplete [**1-5**] GIB and poor PO. She is now having  adequate urine output
   and her  Cr down to 2.4 today with some additional IVFs over past day.
   Watch closely as can have post ATN diuresis
   - renal following, no indication for HD as Cr decreasing
   - continue to trend urine output, Cr
   - watch I/Os,  goal to run even today
   - check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/up renal recs
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 10 unless any active bleeding, transfuse plts as
   needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - SW consult once more stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock. She was admitted with AMS, alcoholic hepatitis, and GIB. 

The patient has made improvements in her mental status, respiratory support, and nutritional intake. She was extubated successfully and is maintaining on RA. She has sputum production with possible infiltrate on CXR, so she was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime empirically. Sputum cultures have been sent off for testing. 

The patient received a LR bolus to maintain fluid balance and then advanced to regular diet last night. Her allergies include the last dose of antibiotics, Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 129/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's physical examination shows improvement in alertness and interaction. She is less jaundiced and has dry skin without petechiae or telangiectasias. Scleral icterus is present, and there is no active bleeding from the nose/mouth. 

Her abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds and hepat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), alcoholic hepatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Since admission, she has been extubated and maintained on room air. Her mental status has improved, and she is now producing sputum, which may indicate an infiltrate on chest X-ray. She has been started on empirical antibiotics, and sputum cultures are pending. The patient received a liter of normal saline bolus to maintain fluid balance and has advanced to a regular diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of sputum production and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests a risk of pneumonia. The patient is already on empirical antibiotics, which is appropriate.
2. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status has improved, there is still a possibility of delirium due to her underlying condition and ICU stay. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's initial presentation included gastrointestinal bleeding, and although it seems to have stabilized, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding. Monitoring vital signs and maintaining appropriate coagulation profile is important.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for signs of hepatic dysfunction and managing"

   Assessment and Plan:
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock found to
   have alcoholic hepatitis.
   .
   # Alcoholic hepatitis  :
   Patient has discriminant function>32 but given GI bleeding ( esophageal
   varices oozing & banded on  EGD), steroids being held now. Total
   bilirubin continues to be elevated near 30 and INR still elevated at 2.
   0 today.
   .
   - continue pentoxyphylline, holding off on steroids for now
   -  f/up liver recs
   - continue dophoff tubefeeds
   - continue lactulose / rifaxamin
   - continue Cipro day 4 of  5 day course
   - trending Hcts  [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue MVI, thiamine, daily folate
   - f/up additional hepatitis studies, ceruloplasmin,  as well as SMA &
   IGG for full hepatitis workup
   - SW consult when more stable
   #Hepatic encephalopathy:  Now on lactulose and rifaximin, appears more
   awake. No evidence of cerebral edema on CT head.
   - consider MRI once stabilized given note of right orbital nonspecific
   finding on CT
   -  Q2hr neuro checks with Q2 pupil checks off sedation
   - if clonic motions or posturing occurs will consider EEG
   #GI Bleeding:  She had urgent EGD on arrival and is now s/p banding of
   esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or melena overnight.  Blood
   pressures still continue to remain stable off of pressors.
   -keep active T&S
   - can switch to [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks now , transfuse to > 25 Hct
   - s/p 3 days of octreotide drip which ended [**3-18**]
   - continue protonix IV BID
   #Leukocytosis:  Still no fever spikes despite WBC climb to 16 today.
   She has also had stable BPs off of pressors. Discolored sputum noted
   and more secretions overnight concerning for pulmonary source/HAP.  CXR
   with possible increased opacity on right. Otherwise, as above, her
   workup was negative for SBP.  Should have adequate coverage for her UTI
   as OSH micro data showed pan-sensitive E.Coli. Sputum cx mixed
   bacteria.
   - start vanc/cefepime for empiric HAP coverage
   - follow fever count
   -continue Cipro
   - repeat blood cultures if spikes
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:
   BP now improved, off pressors. Suspected hypovolemia, possible
   urosepsis. Para negative for SBP. OSH urine cultures grew
   - complete 5d course of cipro as above
   - F/u OSH micro data for recent UTI , CIS
   - Continue to trend lactates
   . .
   #Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely related to renal failure and elevated
   lactate. Anion Gap coming down to 15-16 range now ( from 20s) .
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -renal recs appreciated
   .
   #ARF: Improved with IVF arguing for prerenal component. Likely volume
   deplete [**1-5**] GIB and poor PO. Cr trending down, adequate urine output.
   - continue to trend urine output, Cr
   - check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/up renal recs & results of latest sediment / urine eos / urine
   lytes
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - SW consult once more stable

The patient, a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, alcoholic cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure, and shock, has been admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with acute mental status changes (AMS), alcoholic hepatitis, and GIB. The patient was extubated successfully and maintained on regular air. The patient's mental status improved, and she showed signs of interaction. The patient had sputum production with possible infiltrate on chest X-ray, so she was started on empirical antibiotics (vanc/cefepime). The patient received a liter of normal saline bolus to maintain fluid balance and started taking more oral intake, advancing to a regular diet. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/58 mmHg to 141/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's neurological examination shows no active bleeding from the nose/mouth, regular heart rhythm, and normal extremity movements. The patient's laboratory results show elevated total bilirubin, INR, white blood cell count, and lactate levels, but other parameters are within normal limits. The patient has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, GI bleeding, leukocytosis, hypotension/shock, metabolic acid"

   Assessment and Plan:
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock found to
   have alcoholic hepatitis.
   .
   # Alcoholic hepatitis :  Despite her recent discriminant function>32,
   opted not to treat with any steroids given her marked GI bleeding (
   esophageal varices oozing & banded after EGD on [**3-16**]).  Total bilirubin
   continues to be elevated but has now dipped from 30 to 28 range today.
   INR still elevated at 2. 1 today. All recent  hepatitis studies,
   ceruloplasmin, SMA & IGG all negative for any alternative hepatitis
   causes and social history of recent heavy ETOH use most consistent with
   alcoholic hepatitis.
   .
   - continue pentoxyphylline, holding off on steroids for now
   -  f/up liver recs
   - continue lactulose / rifaxamin
   - continue last day of Cipro ( day 5 of  5 )
   - trending Hcts  [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue MVI, thiamine, daily folate
   - SW consult when more stable
   #Hepatic encephalopathy:  Now on lactulose and rifaximin, appears more
   awake after extubation. No evidence of cerebral edema on recent CT
   head. No additional questionable clonic motions or posturing overnight.
   -  consider MRI once stabilized given note of right orbital nonspecific
   finding on CT
   -  [**Hospital1 **]  neuro checks at this point
   - continue lactulose
   #GI Bleeding:  She had urgent EGD on arrival and is now s/p banding of
   esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or melena overnight.  Blood
   pressures still continue to remain stable off of pressors.
   - keep active T&S
   - can switch to [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks now , transfuse to > 25 Hct
   - s/p 3 days of octreotide drip which ended [**3-18**]
   - continue protonix IV BID
   #Leukocytosis:  Still no fever spikes despite WBC climb up to 20 range
   today. She has also had stable BPs off of pressors. Discolored sputum
   noted and more secretions concerning for pulmonary source/HAP.  CXR
   with opacity on right. Otherwise, as above, her workup was negative for
   SBP.  Should have adequate coverage for her UTI as OSH micro data
   showed pan-sensitive E.Coli. Sputum cx mixed bacteria.
   .
   - f/up CXR today for interval changes
   - continue on  vanc/cefepime for empiric HAP coverage ( day 2 of 10)
   - follow for fevers / WBC trend
   - continue Cipro
   - repeat blood cultures if spikes
   - consider repeat sputum cultures
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: BP now improved, off of all pressors. Suspected
   hypovolemia with recent poor PO intake and GIB on admission. Also
   concern initially for possible urosepsis although sepsis seems less
   likely a component. Para negative for SBP. OSH urine cultures grew
   - gentle IVFs as needed
   - complete 5d course of cipro as above / today is last day
   - CIS
   - Continue to trend lactates
   . .
   #Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely related to renal failure and elevated
   lactate. Anion Gap coming down to 15-16 range now ( from 20s) .
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -renal recs appreciated
   .
   #ARF: Improved with IVF arguing for prerenal component. Likely volume
   deplete [**1-5**] GIB and poor PO. Cr trending down, adequate urine output.
   - continue to trend urine output, Cr
   - check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/up renal recs & results of latest sediment / urine eos / urine
   lytes
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 30, transfuse plts as needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - SW consult once more stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted with acute mental status changes (AMS), alcoholic hepatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient was extubated and is now maintaining on room air. There is improvement in her mental status. The patient has sputum production and a possible infiltrate on chest X-ray, for which she has been started on empirical antibiotics. She received a liter of normal saline bolus to maintain fluid balance and has been advanced to a regular diet. The patient has allergies to antibiotics and is on various medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 129/58 mmHg to 141/67 mmHg. She is oxygenating well at 100% saturation. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvements. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and other abnormalities consistent with alcoholic hepatitis and acute renal failure. The patient is being treated for hepatic encephalopathy, GI bleeding, leukocytosis, hypotension, shock, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and a history of anorexia/bulimia. She is on multiple medications and has ongoing monitoring and follow-up plans."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted with altered mental status (AMS), alcoholic hepatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has shown improvement in her mental status and is now extubated and maintaining spontaneous respirations. The patient has sputum production with a possible infiltrate on chest X-ray, for which she has been started on empirical antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefepime). She received a liter of normal saline bolus to maintain fluid balance and has advanced to a regular diet.

Medical Complications:
1. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient has a history of heavy alcohol use and presents with signs of alcoholic hepatitis, including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient experienced GI bleeding, likely due to esophageal varices, which were subsequently banded. She is currently stable without active bleeding.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient had hepatic encephalopathy, which is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypovolemia and sepsis. Her creatinine levels have improved with fluid resuscitation.

   Assessment and Plan:
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock found to
   have alcoholic hepatitis.
   .
   # Alcoholic hepatitis :  Despite her recent discriminant function>32,
   opted not to treat with any steroids given her marked GI bleeding (
   esophageal varices oozing & banded after EGD on [**3-16**]).  Total bilirubin
   continues to be elevated but has now dipped from 30 to 28 range today.
   INR still elevated at 2. 1 today. All recent  hepatitis studies,
   ceruloplasmin, SMA & IGG all negative for any alternative hepatitis
   causes and social history of recent heavy ETOH use most consistent with
   alcoholic hepatitis.
   - start nadolol today with hold parameters
   - continue pentoxyphylline, holding off on steroids for now
   -  f/up liver recs
   - continue lactulose / rifaxamin
   - continue last day of Cipro ( day 5 of  5 )
   - trending Hcts  [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue MVI, thiamine, daily folate
   - SW consult when more stable
   #Hepatic encephalopathy:  Now on lactulose and rifaximin, appears more
   awake after extubation. No evidence of cerebral edema on recent CT
   head. No additional questionable clonic motions or posturing overnight.
   -  consider MRI once stabilized given note of right orbital nonspecific
   finding on CT
   -  [**Hospital1 **]  neuro checks at this point
   - continue lactulose
   #GI Bleeding:  She had urgent EGD on arrival and is now s/p banding of
   esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or melena overnight.  Blood
   pressures still continue to remain stable off of pressors.
   - keep active T&S
   - can switch to [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks now , transfuse to > 25 Hct
   - s/p 3 days of octreotide drip which ended [**3-18**]
   - continue protonix IV BID
   #Leukocytosis:  Still no fever spikes despite WBC climb up to 20 range
   today. No evidence of active respiratory infection.  CXR with opacity
   on right. Otherwise, as above, her workup was negative for SBP.  Should
   have adequate coverage for her UTI as OSH micro data showed
   pan-sensitive E.Coli. Sputum cx mixed bacteria.
   - discontinue vanc/cefepime today
   - follow for fevers / WBC trend
   - continue Cipro
   - repeat blood cultures if spikes
   - consider repeat sputum cultures
   .. .
   #Metabolic Acidosis:  Continues to improve. Likely related to renal
   failure and elevated lactate. Anion Gap coming down to 15-range now (
   from 20s) .
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -renal recs appreciated
   .
   #ARF: Improved with IVF arguing for prerenal component. Likely volume
   deplete [**1-5**] GIB and poor PO. She is now having  adequate urine output
   and her  Cr down to 2.4 today with some additional IVFs over past day.
   Watch closely as can have post ATN diuresis
   - renal following, no indication for HD as Cr decreasing
   - continue to trend urine output, Cr
   - watch I/Os,  goal to run even today
   - check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/up renal recs
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 10 unless any active bleeding, transfuse plts as
   needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - SW consult once more stable

   Disposition:  ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure, and shock. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis and is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient's recent discriminant function value was greater than 32, so steroids were not administered. Her total bilirubin levels are still elevated but have decreased from 30 to 28 range today. The patient is on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, nadolol for portal hypertension, pentoxyphylline for liver health, and continuing with last day of Cipro. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, and ARF. She is being closely monitored for various conditions and complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is on lactulose and rifaximin, which are appropriate treatments for hepatic encephalopathy. It is important to continue monitoring her mental status and neurologic checks.
2. GI bleeding: Although the patient has been stabilized with banding of esophageal varices, there is still a risk of re-bleeding. Active T&S and HCT checks should be continued.
3. Leukocytosis: Although the patient's WBC count is elevated, there is no fever or evidence of active infection."

   Assessment and Plan:
   45 yo female with history of eating disorders, ETOH cirrhosis here with
   fulminant hepatic failure, GIB, acute renal failure, and shock found to
   have alcoholic hepatitis.
   .
   # Alcoholic hepatitis :  Despite her recent discriminant function>32,
   opted not to treat with any steroids given her marked GI bleeding (
   esophageal varices oozing & banded after EGD on [**3-16**]).  Total bilirubin
   continues to be elevated but has now dipped from 30 to 28 range today.
   INR still elevated at 2. 1 today. All recent  hepatitis studies,
   ceruloplasmin, SMA & IGG all negative for any alternative hepatitis
   causes and social history of recent heavy ETOH use most consistent with
   alcoholic hepatitis.
   - start nadolol today with hold parameters
   - continue pentoxyphylline, holding off on steroids for now
   -  f/up liver recs
   - continue lactulose / rifaxamin
   - continue last day of Cipro ( day 5 of  5 )
   - trending Hcts  [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue MVI, thiamine, daily folate
   - SW consult when more stable
   #Hepatic encephalopathy:  Now on lactulose and rifaximin, appears more
   awake after extubation. No evidence of cerebral edema on recent CT
   head. No additional questionable clonic motions or posturing overnight.
   -  consider MRI once stabilized given note of right orbital nonspecific
   finding on CT
   -  [**Hospital1 **]  neuro checks at this point
   - continue lactulose
   #GI Bleeding:  She had urgent EGD on arrival and is now s/p banding of
   esophageal varices. No hemetemesis or melena overnight.  Blood
   pressures still continue to remain stable off of pressors.
   - keep active T&S
   - can switch to [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks now , transfuse to > 25 Hct
   - s/p 3 days of octreotide drip which ended [**3-18**]
   - continue protonix IV BID
   #Leukocytosis:  Still no fever spikes despite WBC climb up to 20 range
   today. No evidence of active respiratory infection.  CXR with opacity
   on right. Otherwise, as above, her workup was negative for SBP.  Should
   have adequate coverage for her UTI as OSH micro data showed
   pan-sensitive E.Coli. Sputum cx mixed bacteria.
   - discontinue vanc/cefepime today
   - follow for fevers / WBC trend
   - continue Cipro
   - repeat blood cultures if spikes
   - consider repeat sputum cultures
   .. .
   #Metabolic Acidosis:  Continues to improve. Likely related to renal
   failure and elevated lactate. Anion Gap coming down to 15-range now (
   from 20s) .
   -follow AG trend, electrolytes, Cr and ABG compensation
   -renal recs appreciated
   .
   #ARF: Improved with IVF arguing for prerenal component. Likely volume
   deplete [**1-5**] GIB and poor PO. She is now having  adequate urine output
   and her  Cr down to 2.4 today with some additional IVFs over past day.
   Watch closely as can have post ATN diuresis
   - renal following, no indication for HD as Cr decreasing
   - continue to trend urine output, Cr
   - watch I/Os,  goal to run even today
   - check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/up renal recs
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely secondary to chronic liver diasease and
   may be element of additional marrow suppression ETOH use.
   - keep platelets above 10 unless any active bleeding, transfuse plts as
   needed
   - follow cbc daily
   ..
   #History of anorexia/bulimia: Confirmed with sister and father. Unclear
   if patient is actively abusing laxatives.
   - monitor electrolytes as above
   - SW consult once more stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, alcoholic hepatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been improving steadily since extubation, with a stable mental status and no longer intubated. The patient's sputum production suggests a possible infiltrate on chest X-ray, so she was started on antibiotics empirically. She received a liter of lactated Ringer's bolus to maintain positive fluid balance and advanced to a regular diet last night.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient shows signs of improvement with the use of lactulose and rifaximin. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary due to the presence of right orbital findings on CT.
2. GI bleeding: The patient underwent an urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and is now stable after banding of esophageal varices. Continuous monitoring for any signs of rebleeding is essential.
3. Leukocytosis: Despite the elevated white blood cell count, there are no fever spikes or evidence of active respiratory infection. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of infection, and sputum cultures may be repeated.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's condition is improving, likely related to renal failure and elevated lactate levels. Close follow-up of anion gap, electrolytes, creatinine, and ABG compensation is necessary.
5. Acute renal failure (ARF):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female who was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), alcoholic hepatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was extubated and is now maintaining on room air. Her mental status has improved, and she is more alert and interactive. She is producing sputum, which may indicate an infiltrate on the chest X-ray, so she has been started on empiric antibiotics. The patient received a liter of normal saline bolus to maintain a positive fluid balance and has advanced to a regular diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of sputum production and an infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. The patient has already been started on empiric antibiotics, which is appropriate for treating pneumonia.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient was initially admitted with GIB, there is no mention of ongoing bleeding in the progress note. However, it is important to monitor for any signs of recurrent bleeding.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This can cause altered mental status, so it should be considered as a potential cause of her initial AMS.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis has been ordered, but it is still important to monitor for symptoms such as swelling"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with fulminant liver failure. The patient is currently extubated and showing gradual improvement in mental status. There has been an increase in sputum production, and the patient is on antibiotics for possible infection. The patient tolerated advancing to a regular diet. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 104/61 to 134/65 mmHg, heart rate between 78-92 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema and decreased muscle tone. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and increased brown sputum production, indicating a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and considering further diagnostic tests such as sputum or blood cultures may be necessary.
2. Liver Failure: The patient has a history of ETOH cirrhosis and is experiencing fulminant liver failure. Close monitoring of liver function tests and management of complications such as encephalopathy will be required.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection and has been"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ETOH cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with fulminant liver failure. The patient's condition is complicated by potential infection versus increased alcohol consumption. 

The patient's recent events include being extubated without complications, gradual improvement in mental status, increased sputum production, increased white blood cell count, and tolerance of advancing diet to a regular diet. 

The patient has allergies to ciprofloxacin and is currently receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and pantoprazole. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), blood pressure ranging from 104/61 mmHg to 134/65 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,579 mL and output of 3,205 mL over 24 hours. 

Physical examination findings include thinness, confusion, scleral icterus, poor dentition, clear breath sounds, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, muscle wasting, cool skin, and decreased tone. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, sodium of 123 mg/dL, potassium of 2.0 mg/dL, chloride of 60 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 27.4%, magnesium of 3.3 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 116 mEq/L, creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, glucose of 123 mg/dL, and albumin of 3.2 g/dL. 

Based on the assessment and plan, the patient has ETOH cirrhosis with gradual improvement in bilirubin/MELD score but persistent encephalopathy. The plan includes continuing penitentilyline, lactulose for encephalopathy, social work assistance, neurologic checks, and starting nadolol due to history of gastrointestinal bleeding and changing proton pump inhibitor to oral. 

The patient also has leukocytosis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. The respiratory failure is improving with tolerance of room air. Renal failure is improving with hydration and will require nephrology input. 

The patient is tolerating a regular diet and ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, arterial and PICC lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ dysfunctions."
