","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. He was admitted to the ICU and started on amiodarone for arrhythmias. The patient has no known drug allergies. He received a total of 61 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with 500 mL of urine output. His vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/52-136/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm remains in sinus rhythm. The physical examination was not fully assessed due to limitations. There are no significant changes in the patient's medical or family history. Review of systems is unchanged from admission. The patient continues to receive prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Arrhythmias: The patient was started on amiodarone for arrhythmias, indicating a pre-existing condition. Continuous monitoring of the heart rhythm is necessary to detect any potential arrhythmias.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a total of 61 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, which may indicate a fluid imbalance."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 2633**] is a 76 year old man with history of hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia and CAD, s/p DES to LAD, presenting with worsening
   dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema and atrial bigeminy with
   NSVT.
   .
   # Dizziness / NSVT : Given findings of bradycardia and NSVT, most
   likely cause of symptoms is hypoperfusion. Although [**Location (un) 250**]
   documentation reports bradycardia however, it is noted that there is a
   discrepance  between pulse and electrocardiographically recorded rate;
   this is likely secondary to bigeminy which prevents differentiation of
   the two closely spaced beats and dose not represent true bradycardia.
   <br>
   Regarding VT/NSVT, given history of three vessel disease, it is likely
   that this represents new ischemic event, likely silent and subacute
   leading to left ventricular scar given right bundle morphology of VT.
   <br>
   Differential for new VT includes scar mediated as above, as well as
   ischemic, electrolyte disorders and medication side effects. Admission
   labs however seems to point away from active ischemia and electrolyte
   disorders as etiology.
   -- Rule out for MI with serial enzmes
   -- ECHO Tuesday
   -- Continue Amiodarone, finish IV load overnight
   -- Obtain TFT's, LFT's.
   -- Continue aspirin
   -- Continue beta blocker given concern for ischemia, although at
   reduced dose given amiodarone load.
   -- Anticipate cardiac catheterization monday.
   -- Diuresis
   .
   # RIGHT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FAILURE: Physical exam suggestive of right
   sided volume overload without significant pulmonary edema, although
   hilar lymphadenopathy suggests some chronic congestion. Possible
   unifying diagnosis to consider is recent ischemic event leading to
   symptomatic systolic heart failure as well as scar formation.
   -- ECHO as above
   -- IV Lasix, start with 10mg IV given pt is lasix naive
   -- Rule out MI as above
   -- Goal 1L negative overnight
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Unclear what patien't baseline is currently,
   although [**Location (un) 250**] labs with creatinine of 1.6 in [**2131**].
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   -- Monitor closely
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold amlodipine at this time, would favor using ACEI
   given concern for both excessive nodal agents and new systolic heart
   failure.
   .
   # GOUT: Not active at this time.
   .
   # ALCOHOL USE: Although low concern for abuse, given age withdrawal at
   low doses is possible.
   -- Monitor closely
   -- Although would consider benzos if patient is agitated, would avoid
   them for now given concern for delirium.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD), who has undergone a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (DES) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, and atrial bigeminy with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 70 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 130/70 mmHg to 148/70 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The patient is receiving amiodarone infusion and heparin sodium prophylaxis.

Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD) to the mandible, irregular heart rhythm with an S2 heart sound, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's breath sounds are clear and symmetric, with no signs of respiratory distress. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 12.0 g/dL, glucose level of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 2633**] is a 76 year old man with history of hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia and CAD, s/p DES to LAD, presenting with worsening
   dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema and atrial bigeminy with
   NSVT.
   .
   # Dizziness / NSVT : Given findings of bradycardia and NSVT, most
   likely cause of symptoms is hypoperfusion. Although [**Location (un) 250**]
   documentation reports bradycardia however, it is noted that there is a
   discrepance  between pulse and electrocardiographically recorded rate;
   this is likely secondary to bigeminy which prevents differentiation of
   the two closely spaced beats and dose not represent true bradycardia.
   <br>
   Regarding VT/NSVT, given history of three vessel disease, it is likely
   that this represents new ischemic event, likely silent and subacute
   leading to left ventricular scar given right bundle morphology of VT.
   <br>
   Differential for new VT includes scar mediated as above, as well as
   ischemic, electrolyte disorders and medication side effects. Admission
   labs however seems to point away from active ischemia and electrolyte
   disorders as etiology.
   -- Rule out for MI with serial enzmes
   -- ECHO Tuesday
   -- Continue Amiodarone, finish IV load overnight
   -- Obtain TFT's, LFT's.
   -- Continue aspirin
   -- Continue beta blocker given concern for ischemia, although at
   reduced dose given amiodarone load.
   -- Anticipate cardiac catheterization monday.
   -- Diuresis
   .
   # RIGHT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FAILURE: Physical exam suggestive of right
   sided volume overload without significant pulmonary edema, although
   hilar lymphadenopathy suggests some chronic congestion. Possible
   unifying diagnosis to consider is recent ischemic event leading to
   symptomatic systolic heart failure as well as scar formation.
   -- ECHO as above
   -- IV Lasix, start with 10mg IV given pt is lasix naive
   -- Rule out MI as above
   -- Goal 1L negative overnight
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Unclear what patien't baseline is currently,
   although [**Location (un) 250**] labs with creatinine of 1.6 in [**2131**].
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   -- Monitor closely
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold amlodipine at this time, would favor using ACEI
   given concern for both excessive nodal agents and new systolic heart
   failure.
   .
   # GOUT: Not active at this time.
   .
   # ALCOHOL USE: Although low concern for abuse, given age withdrawal at
   low doses is possible.
   -- Monitor closely
   -- Although would consider benzos if patient is agitated, would avoid
   them for now given concern for delirium.
   .

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 51 bpm (with a range of 51-83 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 127/47 mmHg to 166/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (with a range of 16-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL, platelet count of 134 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.02 ng/mL, blood glucose level of 96 mg/dL, and sodium level of 139 mEq/L.
