   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presents to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive vs. cardiogenic shock.
   .
   CORONARIES: Pt with known CAD, initial enzymes at OSH negative, though
   now rising with CK 1872
 7559, in setting of a single 150J shock at
   OSH and no clear ischemic EKG changes.  Pt also with new globally
   reduced EF on bedside echo at OSH and here which may be secondary to
   concurrent acidosis/extreme critical illness.  Most likely not ACS.
   - Can d/c heparin drip as ACS appears unlikely (low MB index, troponin
   rise not unexpected in setting of sepsis)
   - start SC heparin
   - Continue Aspirin daily
   - Continue statin
   - start BB once more hemodynamically stable
   - Trend cardiac enzymes to peak CK
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG in AM
   - Consider cardiac cath once more clinically stable for further
   evaluation
   .
   PUMP: Pt with history of diastolic CHF, now with reduced EF on bedside
   TTE as above, mixed picture ACS/sepsis and metabolic acidosis given
   lactate of 7.0 at OSH and rising cardiac enzymes. MAPs in mid 50's on
   arrival, but patient started on low dose levophed overnight for low
   blood pressures and nadir of 74/38 after initation of fentanyl/versed
   for sedation.  CVP on arrival 12.  Central venous O2 sat 87 on
   admission now 99.  Globally reduced EF [**1-20**] acidosis vs. acute aschemia
   (w/ rising troponins).
   - Formal TTE in AM
   - Responded well to fluid bolus, maintain CVP ~15.
   - Hold on further diuresis with Lasix for now given borderline blood
   pressures and CVP of 12 with low urine output on admission; unclear if
   patient responded to IV Lasix dose given at OSH
   - Hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was found to be
   tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT with aberrancy
   based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and loaded with
   amiodarone upon transfer.
   - d/c amiodarone drip
   - beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates.
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: CXR showing diffuse fluffly pulmonary infiltrates
   concerning for ARDS. Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal
   volume strategy and PEEP to support increased lung resistance.  Doing
   well with wean.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - If oxygenation continues to improve with FiO2< 60%, wean down PEEP
   .
   ID: Possible sepsis given leukocytosis, with suspected urinary source,
   though pulmonary source could also be present given increased RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Urine legionella negative.
   - Fontinue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for
   double gram negative coverage.  Recent hospital and rehab stay makes
   hospital acquired organisms possible.
   - Abdominal ultrasound in AM to evaluate for abscess or other potential
   intraabdominal source of infection
   - F/U blood and urine cultures
   - f/u OSH cultures.
   .
   ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Pt with baseline cr of 1.7, 2.0 at OSH
   earlier today, now 2.5 and oliguric, likely related to pre-renal
   hypoperfusion in setting of severe systemic illness and reduced EF.
   UOP improved somewhat after small IVF bolus increasing to > 20 cc/hr
   overnight
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - Follow UOP and consider additional small volume IVF bolus
   - Image kidneys with abdominal ultrasound as above
   - f/u Urine lytes
   .
   DIABETES MELLITUS: Pt with significantly elevated blood sugars at OSH
   and on admission.  Patient with history of type II DM and at risk for
   hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia, though currently blood glucoses
   not ranging above 600.
   - f/u serum ketones
   - IV insulin drip following [**Last Name (un) 72**] protocol to keep serum glucose <150
   - monitor blood glucose q1 hour
   .
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt with large gap metabolic acidosis, initial
   lactate at OSH 7, on arrival here improved to 3.2.  Given elevated
   blood sugars, may also be in DKA, though patient with history of type
   II DM, and DKA less likely.   Serum ketones pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp
   sodium bicarb at OSH.  Gap closed this morning, appears to have largely
   resolved.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation and will slowly decrease
   hyperventilation for respiratory compensation.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   .
   FEN: Hyponatremia: falsely low given elevated blood glucose on arrival
   with improvement after correction of hyperglycemia.  NPO for now.
   - F/u nutrition recs for TF
   .

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. She presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and was found to be in respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also had a likely supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy, new reduced ejection fraction, leukocytosis, and bilateral air space opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and being managed for sepsis, acute kidney injury, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, transaminitis, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of bed and implementing appropriate oral hygiene.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Due to prolonged immobilization, there is an increased risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures like low molecular weight heparin should be initiated.
3. Nosocomial infection: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and invasive lines, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections, particularly central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI)."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presents to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive vs. cardiogenic shock.
   .
   CORONARIES: Pt with known CAD, initial enzymes at OSH negative, though
   now rising with CK 1872
 7559, in setting of a single 150J shock at
   OSH and no clear ischemic EKG changes.  Pt also with new globally
   reduced EF on bedside echo at OSH and here which may be secondary to
   concurrent acidosis/extreme critical illness.  Most likely not ACS.
   - Can d/c heparin drip as ACS appears unlikely (low MB index, troponin
   rise not unexpected in setting of sepsis)
   - start SC heparin
   - Continue Aspirin daily
   - Continue statin
   - start BB once more hemodynamically stable
   - Trend cardiac enzymes to peak CK
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG in AM
   - Consider cardiac cath once more clinically stable for further
   evaluation
   .
   PUMP: Pt with history of diastolic CHF, now with reduced EF on bedside
   TTE as above, mixed picture ACS/sepsis and metabolic acidosis given
   lactate of 7.0 at OSH and rising cardiac enzymes. MAPs in mid 50's on
   arrival, but patient started on low dose levophed overnight for low
   blood pressures and nadir of 74/38 after initation of fentanyl/versed
   for sedation.  CVP on arrival 12.  Central venous O2 sat 87 on
   admission now 99.  Globally reduced EF [**1-20**] acidosis vs. acute aschemia
   (w/ rising troponins).
   - Formal TTE in AM
   - Responded well to fluid bolus, maintain CVP ~15.
   - Hold on further diuresis with Lasix for now given borderline blood
   pressures and CVP of 12 with low urine output on admission; unclear if
   patient responded to IV Lasix dose given at OSH
   - Hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was found to be
   tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT with aberrancy
   based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and loaded with
   amiodarone upon transfer.
   - d/c amiodarone drip
   - beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates.
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: CXR showing diffuse fluffly pulmonary infiltrates
   concerning for ARDS. Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal
   volume strategy and PEEP to support increased lung resistance.  Doing
   well with wean.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - If oxygenation continues to improve with FiO2< 60%, wean down PEEP
   .
   ID: Possible sepsis given leukocytosis, with suspected urinary source,
   though pulmonary source could also be present given increased RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Urine legionella negative.
   - Fontinue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for
   double gram negative coverage.  Recent hospital and rehab stay makes
   hospital acquired organisms possible.
   - Abdominal ultrasound in AM to evaluate for abscess or other potential
   intraabdominal source of infection
   - F/U blood and urine cultures
   - f/u OSH cultures.
   .
   ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Pt with baseline cr of 1.7, 2.0 at OSH
   earlier today, now 2.5 and oliguric, likely related to pre-renal
   hypoperfusion in setting of severe systemic illness and reduced EF.
   UOP improved somewhat after small IVF bolus increasing to > 20 cc/hr
   overnight
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - Follow UOP and consider additional small volume IVF bolus
   - Image kidneys with abdominal ultrasound as above
   - f/u Urine lytes
   .
   DIABETES MELLITUS: Pt with significantly elevated blood sugars at OSH
   and on admission.  Patient with history of type II DM and at risk for
   hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia, though currently blood glucoses
   not ranging above 600.
   - f/u serum ketones
   - IV insulin drip following [**Last Name (un) 72**] protocol to keep serum glucose <150
   - monitor blood glucose q1 hour
   .
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt with large gap metabolic acidosis, initial
   lactate at OSH 7, on arrival here improved to 3.2.  Given elevated
   blood sugars, may also be in DKA, though patient with history of type
   II DM, and DKA less likely.   Serum ketones pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp
   sodium bicarb at OSH.  Gap closed this morning, appears to have largely
   resolved.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation and will slowly decrease
   hyperventilation for respiratory compensation.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   .
   FEN: Hyponatremia: falsely low given elevated blood glucose on arrival
   with improvement after correction of hyperglycemia.  NPO for now.
   - F/u nutrition recs for TF

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM, and dyslipidemia. She presented to OSH ED complaining of SOB and arrived in extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT with aberrancy based on 12-lead EKG. She was shocked once at OSH and loaded with amiodarone upon transfer.

Her current condition includes:
- Coronaries: Known CAD, initial enzymes negative, though now rising with CK 1872, in setting of a single 150J shock at OSH and no clear ischemic EKG changes.
- Pump: History of diastolic CHF, now with reduced EF on bedside TTE as above, mixed picture ACS/sepsis and metabolic acidosis given lactate of 7.0 at OSH and rising cardiac enzymes.
- Rhythm: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT with aberrancy based on 12-lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and loaded with amiodarone upon transfer.
- Respiratory failure: CXR showing diffuse fluffly pulmonary infiltrates concerning for ARDS. Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presented to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive shock.
   .
   # Repiratory failure: CXR initially concerning for ARDS, though no
   clear etiology.  CXR this morning without clear infiltrate.  Per son,
   patient is ""prone"" to pneumonia, so this is most likely source of
   possible septic/distributive shock. Also, with significant leukocytosis
   which may be from infection vs stress reaction. Requiring PEEPs >10 to
   maintain oxygenation, but has been able to wean significantly since
   admission.  Patient was alert and awake on transfer to MICU, denies
   fever prior to admission, though son states she was ""cold"" on the days
   leading up to admission. Urine legionella negative.
   - Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume strategy
   and PEEP to support increased lung resistance.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - Continue to wean ventilation, will consider decreased PEEP now that
   FiO2 is at 40% and oxygenating well
   - Continue to treat for HCAP w/ zosyn, vanc, cipro as had been in house
   in [**Month (only) 8**] and rehab facility up until 3 weeks ago
   - Daily CXR
   - Trend WBC
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up cultures from OSH ([**Last Name (un) 2491**])
 Need to call their lab today.
   - Consider CT torso if no improvement to assess for
   intraabdominal/thoracic source of infection
   # Coronary artery disease: Has history of CAD w/ DES to LAD, now with
   significant troponin leak in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock
   at OSH.  Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS and
   patient has completed 24H of heparin gtt. MBI not significantly
   elevated.  Likely myocardial stunning/ischemia in the setting of
   sepsis, critical illness and profound acidemia (lactate 7.0 at OSH).
   No clear new ischemic ECG changes.
   - Continue to trend CE until downtrending
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - BB when HD stable
   - Cards consult prn
   # Global LV systolic HF: Patient now w/ globally reduced EF on TTE with
   elevated CE as above.  Has history of dCHF.  Has been weaned off of
   levophed while in the CCU and has not required fluids to maintain CVP.
   BPs now stable.  Likely [**1-20**] acidemia/critical illness as above. ScVO2
   in CCU was 99 on evening of admission up from 87.
   - Repeat TTE once patient stabilized and is improved from current
   illness to access for any residual deficit
   - Hold antihypertensives for now, restart prn
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was
   found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT
   with aberrancy based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and
   loaded with amiodarone upon transfer, since dc'd.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates; if no blood
   pressure room, consider restarting amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline creatinine of around 1.4,
   now up to 2.7.  Patient had been oliguric, but now improved.  Likely in
   the setting of hypoperfusion given globally reduced EF and critical
   illness.
   - Continue to follow urine output, goal >20 cc/hr
   - Urine lytes/eos
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - IVF prn to maintain UOP
   - Consider renal ultrasound if no improvement in creatinine in the
   morning
   .
   # DM type 2:  BS significantly elevated at OSH and in CCU.  Has been on
   insulin gtt since admission with blood sugars were trending up and
   insulin gtt restarted.  Initially, was concern for HHS given gap
   acidosis and elevated FS, though no glucosuria.
   - Will transition to home insulin regimen if possible overnight; per
   patient, she takes 35/40 NPH and humalog SS.
   .
   # AG acidosis: GAP now resolved.  Initial lactate at OSH was 7, now
   wnl.  Concern for HHS, though no glucosuria or other metabolic
   derangements.  Serum B hydroxybuterate pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp sodium
   bicarb at OSH.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   - Continue to follow chem panel, gap/bicarb.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   - Follow up final read of abd ultrasound done in CCU
   .
   # Leg pain: Patient had recent illness with negative work up. Per her
   son, has had significant pain not improved post rehab.  This had been a
   major concern of hers for the few days prior to this admission.  L knee
   was tapped during prior admission, consistent with arthritis.
   - Continue fentanyl while intubated for pain control
   - Consider repeat plain films
   - Will likely require additional PT, pain control once sedation
   wean/extubated
   .
   # FEN: Will initiate TF once available, nutrition recommendations
   appreciated. IVF boluses as needed as above.  Replete lytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and was found to have significant leukocytosis, four quadrant air space opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension, which is concerning for distributive shock. She also has a history of acute coronary syndrome, but this is likely due to myocardial stunning/ischemia in the setting of sepsis, critical illness, and profound acidemia. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, but she remains in the intensive care unit for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She initially had signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but her recent chest X-rays have shown no clear infiltrate. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and weaning off the ventilator may be necessary. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and daily chest X-rays will be needed to assess her progress.

2. Sepsis: The patient's presentation and laboratory results indicate a possible septic state, characterized by leukocytosis, relative hypotension, and increased lactate levels. She has been empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and cultures have been obtained to guide further"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presented to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive shock.
   .
   # Repiratory failure: Likely secondary to CHF.  CXR initially
   concerning for ARDS, though no clear etiology.  CXR this morning
   without clear infiltrate.  Per son, patient is ""prone"" to pneumonia, so
   this is most likely source of possible septic/distributive shock. Also,
   with significant leukocytosis which may be from infection vs stress
   reaction. Requiring PEEPs >10 to maintain oxygenation, but has been
   able to wean significantly since admission.  Patient was alert and
   awake on transfer to MICU, denies fever prior to admission, though son
   states she was ""cold"" on the days leading up to admission. Urine
   legionella negative.
   - Switch to pressure support and continue to wean down sedation.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - Continue to treat for HCAP w/ zosyn, vanc, cipro as had been in house
   in [**Month (only) 8**] and rehab facility up until 3 weeks ago
   - Daily CXR
   - Trend WBC
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up cultures from OSH ([**Last Name (un) 2491**])
 Need to call their lab today.
   - Consider CT torso if no improvement to assess for
   intraabdominal/thoracic source of infection
   # Coronary artery disease: Has history of CAD w/ DES to LAD, now with
   significant troponin leak in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock
   at OSH.  Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS and
   patient has completed 24H of heparin gtt. MBI not significantly
   elevated.  Likely myocardial stunning/ischemia in the setting of
   sepsis, critical illness and profound acidemia (lactate 7.0 at OSH).
   No clear new ischemic ECG changes.
   - Continue to trend CE until downtrending
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - BB when HD stable.  Start at metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and titrate as BP/HR
   tolerates.
   - Cards consult prn
   # Global LV systolic HF: Patient now w/ globally reduced EF on TTE with
   elevated CE as above.  Has history of dCHF.  Has been weaned off of
   levophed while in the CCU and has not required fluids to maintain CVP.
   BPs now stable.  Likely [**1-20**] acidemia/critical illness as above. ScVO2
   in CCU was 99 on evening of admission up from 87.
   - Repeat TTE once patient stabilized and is improved from current
   illness to access for any residual deficit
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was
   found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT
   with aberrancy based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and
   loaded with amiodarone upon transfer, since dc'd.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates; if no blood
   pressure room, consider restarting amiodarone
   - suctioning has also been helpful in breaking pt
s SVT
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline creatinine of around 1.4,
   now up to 2.7.  Patient had been oliguric, but now improved.  Likely in
   the setting of hypoperfusion given globally reduced EF and critical
   illness.
   - Continue to follow urine output, goal >20 cc/hr
   - Urine lytes/eos
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - IVF prn to maintain UOP
   - Consider renal ultrasound if no improvement in creatinine in the
   morning
   .
   # DM type 2:  BS significantly elevated at OSH and in CCU.  Has been on
   insulin gtt since admission with blood sugars were trending up and
   insulin gtt restarted.  Initially, was concern for HHS given gap
   acidosis and elevated FS, though no glucosuria.
   - now that pt is on tube feedings, attempt to wean down heparin gtt and
   then restart pt on her home insulin regimen
   .
   # AG acidosis: GAP now resolved.  Initial lactate at OSH was 7, now
   wnl.  Concern for HHS, though no glucosuria or other metabolic
   derangements.  Serum B hydroxybuterate pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp sodium
   bicarb at OSH.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   - Continue to follow chem panel, gap/bicarb.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   - Follow up final read of abd ultrasound done in CCU
   .
   # Leg pain: Patient had recent illness with negative work up. Per her
   son, has had significant pain not improved post rehab.  This had been a
   major concern of hers for the few days prior to this admission.  L knee
   was tapped during prior admission, consistent with arthritis.
   - Continue fentanyl while intubated for pain control
   - Consider repeat plain films
   - Will likely require additional PT, pain control once sedation
   wean/extubated
   .
   # FEN: Will initiate TF once available, nutrition recommendations
   appreciated. IVF boluses as needed as above.  Replete lytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She had a likely supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy, new reduced ejection fraction, leukocytosis, four quadrant air space opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock. She has been weaned off vasopressor support and has shown improvement in oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, which could be secondary to congestive heart failure. The chest X-ray initially showed findings concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but subsequent X-rays did not reveal any clear infiltrates. The patient has been weaned off respiratory support, but close monitoring and daily chest X-rays are recommended. Pressure support ventilation and continued sedation weaning are planned.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) with a combination of antibiotics. She has leukocytosis, which could be due to infection or stress reaction. Daily chest X-rays, sputum culture, and follow-up blood and urine cultures are needed. If there is no improvement, a CT torso may be considered to assess for intraabdom"

   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation,
   tachycardic with likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF,
   leukocytosis, four quadrant air space opacities on CXR, and relative
   hypotension concerning for distributive shock.
   # Repiratory failure: Likely secondary to CHF.  Also, with significant
   leukocytosis which may be from infection vs stress reaction.

   pressure support
   # Urosepsis
 was able to obtain cultures form OSH, which showed only
   e.coli/klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin
   - will continue patient on ciprofloxacin
   - follow up blood and urine cultures from this hospitalization
 prelim
   sputum gram stain showed no organism and one urine culture had no
   growth
   # Coronary artery disease
 pt has a history of CAD and presented
   elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH.
   MBI was no significant
y elevated.  Per cardiology, this is most likely
   not consistent w/ ACS.  Likely myocardial stunning/ischemia in the
   setting of sepsis, critical illness and profound acidemia (lactate 7.0
   was at OSH).  No clear new ischemic ECG changes.
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - Pt was restarted on her beta blocker yesterday
 currently on toprol
   25 mg TID.
   - Cards consult prn
   # Global LV systolic HF: Patient now w/ globally reduced EF on TTE with
   elevated CE as above.  Has history of dCHF.  Has been weaned off of
   levophed while in the CCU and has not required fluids to maintain CVP.
   BPs now stable.  Likely [**1-20**] acidemia/critical illness as above. ScVO2
   in CCU was 99 on evening of admission up from 87.
   - Repeat TTE once patient stabilized and is improved from current
   illness to access for any residual deficit
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was
   found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT
   with aberrancy based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and
   loaded with amiodarone upon transfer, since dc'd.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates; if no blood
   pressure room, consider restarting amiodarone
   - suctioning has also been helpful in breaking pt
s SVT
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline creatinine of around 1.4,
   now up to 2.7.  Patient had been oliguric, but now improved.  Likely in
   the setting of hypoperfusion given globally reduced EF and critical
   illness.
   - Continue to follow urine output, goal >20 cc/hr
   - Urine lytes/eos
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - IVF prn to maintain UOP
   - Consider renal ultrasound if no improvement in creatinine in the
   morning
   .
   # DM type 2:  BS significantly elevated at OSH and in CCU.  Has been on
   insulin gtt since admission with blood sugars were trending up and
   insulin gtt restarted.  Initially, was concern for HHS given gap
   acidosis and elevated FS, though no glucosuria.
   - now that pt is on tube feedings, attempt to wean down heparin gtt and
   then restart pt on her home insulin regimen
   .
   # AG acidosis: GAP now resolved.  Initial lactate at OSH was 7, now
   wnl.  Concern for HHS, though no glucosuria or other metabolic
   derangements.  Serum B hydroxybuterate pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp sodium
   bicarb at OSH.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   - Continue to follow chem panel, gap/bicarb.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   - Follow up final read of abd ultrasound done in CCU
   .
   # Leg pain: Patient had recent illness with negative work up. Per her
   son, has had significant pain not improved post rehab.  This had been a
   major concern of hers for the few days prior to this admission.  L knee
   was tapped during prior admission, consistent with arthritis.
   - Continue fentanyl while intubated for pain control
   - Consider repeat plain films
   - Will likely require additional PT, pain control once sedation
   wean/extubated
   .
   # FEN: Will initiate TF once available, nutrition recommendations
   appreciated. IVF boluses as needed as above.  Replete lytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardia with likely supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy, new reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, four quadrant air space opacities on chest X-ray (CXR), and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to CHF. Also, with significant leukocytosis which may be from infection vs stress reaction.
2. Urosepsis: The patient has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis, with e.coli and klebsiella in the urine culture. These organisms are sensitive to ciprofloxacin, so it will continue to be used.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and presented with elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH. However, no significant ECG changes were observed, and the cardiologist believes it is unlikely consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is more likely myocardial stunning/ischemia in the setting of sepsis, critical illness, and profound acidemia."

","Based on the provided information, the patient has a complex medical history with multiple ongoing medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is on contact precautions due to a positive MRSA screen. There is also an ongoing infection in the urine with e.coli and klebsiella, both susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment is crucial.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is necessary to ensure adequate gas exchange.

3. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of unstable angina and coronary ischemia. Continuous monitoring of cardiac status and prompt intervention if there are any signs of worsening chest pain or cardiac dysfunction.

4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored and insulin therapy adjusted accordingly to maintain glycemic control.

5. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL, indicating possible acute renal failure. Regular monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including fluid balance and medication adjustments, is essential.

6. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, indicating anemia. Blood transfusion may be necessary to address the low hemoglobin"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation,
   tachycardic with likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF,
   leukocytosis, four quadrant air space opacities on CXR, and relative
   hypotension concerning for distributive shock.
   # Repiratory failure: Likely secondary to CHF.  Also, with significant
   leukocytosis which may be from infection vs stress reaction.
   - Will f/u today
s CXR and continue daily CXR
s to watch for any
   possible lung infections as the cause of the patient
s respiratory
   distress and elevated WBC
   - Trend WBC
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Resume attempts to wean ventilator today by switching patient to
   pressure support
   # Urosepsis
 was able to obtain cultures form OSH, which showed only
   e.coli/klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin
   - will continue patient on ciprofloxacin
   - follow up blood and urine cultures from this hospitalization
 prelim
   sputum gram stain showed no organism and one urine culture had no
   growth
   # Coronary artery disease
 pt has a history of CAD and presented
   elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH.
   MBI was no significant
y elevated.  Per cardiology, this is most likely
   not consistent w/ ACS.  Likely myocardial stunning/ischemia in the
   setting of sepsis, critical illness and profound acidemia (lactate 7.0
   was at OSH).  No clear new ischemic ECG changes.
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - Pt was restarted on her beta blocker yesterday.  Currently on
   metoprolol 25 mg TID.  Will continue to monitor BP and HR.
   - Cards consult prn
   # Global LV systolic HF: Patient now w/ globally reduced EF on TTE with
   elevated CE as above.  Has history of dCHF.  Has been weaned off of
   levophed while in the CCU and has not required fluids to maintain CVP.
   BPs now stable.  Likely [**1-20**] acidemia/critical illness as above. ScVO2
   in CCU was 99 on evening of admission up from 87.
   - Repeat TTE once patient stabilized and is improved from current
   illness to access for any residual deficit
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was
   found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT
   with aberrancy based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and
   loaded with amiodarone upon transfer, since dc'd.
   - improved
 pt had no further issues with SVT overnight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - pt
s beta blocker has been restarted
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline creatinine of around 1.4,
   now at 2.5.  Patient had been oliguric, but now improved.  Likely in
   the setting of hypoperfusion given globally reduced EF and critical
   illness.
   - pt had a urine output of 1.3 L yesterday
   - continue to monitor urinue output, BUN, and creatinine
   .
   # DM type 2:  BS significantly elevated at OSH and in CCU.  Has been on
   insulin gtt since admission with blood sugars were trending up and
   insulin gtt restarted.  Initially, was concern for HHS given gap
   acidosis and elevated FS, though no glucosuria.
   - insulin drip was stopped yesterday morning and pt was put on sliding
   scale insulin
   - blood sugars have been well-controlled with sliding scale insulin
   - will continue to monitor BS
   .
   # AG acidosis: GAP now resolved.  Initial lactate at OSH was 7, now
   wnl.  Concern for HHS, though no glucosuria or other metabolic
   derangements.  Serum B hydroxybuterate pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp sodium
   bicarb at OSH.
   - continue to follow electrolytes daily
   .
   # Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - AST and ALT peaked and are trending down; ALP elevated today, so will
   keep an eye on it
   - coag
s are now WNL
   - continue to monitor AST, ALT, and coags
   - abdominal u/s
 trace fluid in the RUQ, otherwise unremarkable
   .
   # Leg pain: Patient had recent illness with negative work up. Per her
   son, has had significant pain not improved post rehab.  This had been a
   major concern of hers for the few days prior to this admission.  L knee
   was tapped during prior admission, consistent with arthritis.
   - obtain repeat films of the L knee and refer for PT once extubated out
   of the ICU
   .
   # FEN: Starting TF
s today.  Will replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardia with likely supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy, new reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, four quadrant air space opacities on chest X-ray (CXR), and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock. The patient's arterial line stopped, sputum culture was obtained, and an unplanned line/catheter removal was initiated by the patient. The patient is now on pressure support (PS) and awake, doing well, trying to talk to her son. She was restarted on beta-blockers and insulin sliding scale. MRSA screen was positive, so she is on contact precautions. Culture results from outside hospital showed only e.coli and klebsiella in the urine, both susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The patient is being continued on ciprofloxacin, and follow-up blood and urine cultures have been sent. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR set at 18, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, PIP of 28 cmH2O, Plateau of 25 cmH2O, Compliance of 38.5 cmH2O/mL, SpO2 of 98%, ABG of 7.37/41/103/24/-1, Ve of 8.6 L/min, PaO2/FiO2 of 172. The patient's physical examination findings include peripheral vascular issues, skin not assessed, neurologic responses not assessed, and labs/radiology showing various abnormalities. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure likely secondary to CHF, urosepsis, coronary artery disease, global LV systolic HF, SVT with aberrancy, acute on chronic renal failure, DM type 2, AG acidosis, transaminitis, leg pain, and femoral neck fractures. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and elevation of head of bed for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Repiratory failure: Likely secondary to CHF.  CXR initially
   concerning for ARDS, though no clear etiology.  CXR this morning
   without clear infiltrate.  Per son, patient is ""prone"" to pneumonia, so
   this is most likely source of possible septic/distributive shock. Also,
   with significant leukocytosis which may be from infection vs stress
   reaction. Requiring PEEPs >10 to maintain oxygenation, but has been
   able to wean significantly since admission.  Patient was alert and
   awake on transfer to MICU, denies fever prior to admission, though son
   states she was ""cold"" on the days leading up to admission. Urine
   legionella negative.
   - Switch to pressure support and continue to wean down sedation.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - Continue to treat for HCAP w/ zosyn, vanc, cipro as had been in house
   in [**Month (only) 8**] and rehab facility up until 3 weeks ago
   - Daily CXR
   - Trend WBC
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up cultures from OSH ([**Last Name (un) 2491**])
 Need to call their lab today.
   - Consider CT torso if no improvement to assess for
   intraabdominal/thoracic source of infection
   # Urosepsis
   # Coronary artery disease: Has history of CAD w/ DES to LAD, now with
   significant troponin leak in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock
   at OSH.  Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS and
   patient has completed 24H of heparin gtt. MBI not significantly
   elevated.  Likely myocardial stunning/ischemia in the setting of
   sepsis, critical illness and profound acidemia (lactate 7.0 at OSH).
   No clear new ischemic ECG changes.
   - Continue to trend CE until downtrending
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - BB when HD stable.  Start at metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and titrate as BP/HR
   tolerates.
   - Cards consult prn
   # Global LV systolic HF: Patient now w/ globally reduced EF on TTE with
   elevated CE as above.  Has history of dCHF.  Has been weaned off of
   levophed while in the CCU and has not required fluids to maintain CVP.
   BPs now stable.  Likely [**1-20**] acidemia/critical illness as above. ScVO2
   in CCU was 99 on evening of admission up from 87.
   - Repeat TTE once patient stabilized and is improved from current
   illness to access for any residual deficit
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was
   found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT
   with aberrancy based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and
   loaded with amiodarone upon transfer, since dc'd.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates; if no blood
   pressure room, consider restarting amiodarone
   - suctioning has also been helpful in breaking pt
s SVT
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline creatinine of around 1.4,
   now up to 2.7.  Patient had been oliguric, but now improved.  Likely in
   the setting of hypoperfusion given globally reduced EF and critical
   illness.
   - Continue to follow urine output, goal >20 cc/hr
   - Urine lytes/eos
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - IVF prn to maintain UOP
   - Consider renal ultrasound if no improvement in creatinine in the
   morning
   .
   # DM type 2:  BS significantly elevated at OSH and in CCU.  Has been on
   insulin gtt since admission with blood sugars were trending up and
   insulin gtt restarted.  Initially, was concern for HHS given gap
   acidosis and elevated FS, though no glucosuria.
   - now that pt is on tube feedings, attempt to wean down heparin gtt and
   then restart pt on her home insulin regimen
   .
   # AG acidosis: GAP now resolved.  Initial lactate at OSH was 7, now
   wnl.  Concern for HHS, though no glucosuria or other metabolic
   derangements.  Serum B hydroxybuterate pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp sodium
   bicarb at OSH.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   - Continue to follow chem panel, gap/bicarb.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   - Follow up final read of abd ultrasound done in CCU
   .
   # Leg pain: Patient had recent illness with negative work up. Per her
   son, has had significant pain not improved post rehab.  This had been a
   major concern of hers for the few days prior to this admission.  L knee
   was tapped during prior admission, consistent with arthritis.
   - Continue fentanyl while intubated for pain control
   - Consider repeat plain films
   - Will likely require additional PT, pain control once sedation
   wean/extubated
   .
   # FEN: Will initiate TF once available, nutrition recommendations
   appreciated. IVF boluses as needed as above.  Replete lytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes type 2, chronic heart failure, and recent illness with leg pain. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF), and sepsis. The patient's current condition is stable, but she continues to require mechanical ventilation with pressure support and has been weaned off levophed. She is also on a sedation regimen of fentanyl and midazolam.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to CHF. She initially had concerns for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but subsequent chest X-rays did not show clear infiltrates. The patient requires PEEP >10 to maintain oxygenation and has been able to wean significantly since admission.
2. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. Daily chest X-rays, trending white blood cell count, and follow-up blood and urine cultures are planned.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a stent in the left anterior descending artery. She presented with significant troponin leak in the setting of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy and shock"

   - Resume attempts to wean ventilator today by switching patient to
   pressure support
   -Patient needs to get a current ABG
   # Urosepsis
 was able to obtain cultures form OSH, which showed only
   e.coli/klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin
   - will continue patient on ciprofloxacin
   - follow up blood and urine cultures from this hospitalization
 prelim
   sputum gram stain showed no organism and one urine culture had no
   growth
   # Coronary artery disease
 pt has a history of CAD and presented
   elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH.
   Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS.
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - Pt was restarted on her beta blocker yesterday.  Currently on
   metoprolol 25 mg TID.  Will continue to monitor BP and HR.
   - Make sure cards is following patient
   -Patient should be getting daily EKG
   # LV systolic HF-
   - Echo showed a decreased EF on the patient.
   - Consider repeat echo once patient is stable to evaluate for residual
   effects
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy
   - patient is currently in sinus rhythm
   - SVT improved
 pt had no further issues with SVT overnight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - pt
s beta blocker has been restarted

   # Acute on chronic renal failure -
   - Baseline creatinine of around 1.4, now at 2.5
   - This renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion/hypotension and
   critical illness
   - pt had a urine output of 1.3 L yesterday
   - continue to monitor urinue output, BUN, and creatinine
   .
   # DM type 2 -
   - insulin drip was stopped yesterday morning and pt was put on sliding
   scale insulin
   - blood sugars have been well-controlled with sliding scale insulin
   - will continue to monitor BS

   # AG acidosis -
   - AG is not within normal limits
   - continue to follow electrolytes daily

   - continue to monitor AST, ALT, and coags
   - abdominal u/s
 trace fluid in the RUQ, otherwise unremarkable
   .
   # Leg pain
   - pt had been complaining of L knee prior to this admission
 result of
   arthrocentesis were consistent with arthritis
   - obtain repeat films of the L knee and refer for PT once extubated out

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardia with likely supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy, new reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, air space opacities on chest X-ray (CXR), and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to CHF. However, she also has leukocytosis that could be due to infection or stress reaction. Trend WBC and restart her on full antibiotic regimen that was discontinued yesterday (vanc, zosyn, and cipro).
2. Urosepsis: The patient had cultures from OSH showing only E. coli and klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Will continue patient on ciprofloxacin and follow up blood and urine cultures from this hospitalization.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and presented with elevated troponin in the setting of SVT with aberrancy and shock at OSH. Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Continue"

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing respiratory distress and has a history of cardiac issues. The patient's arterial line stopped, and there were instances of unplanned line/catheter removal. The patient also has an infection in the urine caused by E. coli and klebsiella, and they have been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, and they have been receiving fluids with a total input of 2,187 mL and output of 1,340 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 172 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 24 mEq/L. 

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.9 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 166 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 2.7 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 2.39. The patient's electrolytes show low sodium (Na+) level of 24 mEq/L, low potassium (K+) level of 3.2 mg/dL, and elevated chloride (Cl-) level of 138 mEq/L. 

The patient's assessment and plan include anemia secondary to blood loss, tachycardia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus (DM) type I, renal failure, and others. The medical team is planning to reposition the patient's endotracheal tube and repeat sputum cultures. They are also considering further interventions for the patient's cardiac condition and monitoring their renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation,
   tachycardic with likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF,
   leukocytosis, air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension
   concerning for distributive shock
   # Repiratory failure -  Pt
s respiratory failure is likely secondary to
   CHF.  However, she does also have a leukocytosis that could be due to
   infection or stress reaction.
   - Continue to trend WBC
 WBC down from 15.9->10.3 today.
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood Cx as urine Cx from admission
   are negative and OSH Cx showed only e.coli/klebsiella both sensitive to
   Cipro.
   - Resume attempts to wean ventilator today by switching patient to
   pressure support
   -Patient needs to get a current ABG
   -Will gently diurese as CHF may represent stumbling block for
   extubation, 40IV lasix and f/u I/O
   # Urosepsis
 was able to obtain cultures form OSH, which showed only
   e.coli/klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin
   - will continue patient on ciprofloxacin
   - Urine cultures from [**Hospital1 5**] [**6-13**] and [**6-14**] both negative
   - Follow up blood and sputum cultures
 prelim sputum gram stain showed
   no organism
   # Coronary artery disease
 pt has a history of CAD and presented
   elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH.
   Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS.
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - Pt was restarted on her beta blocker Monday.  Currently on metoprolol
   25 mg TID.  Will increase to 50mg TID.  Will continue to monitor BP and
   HR.
   - Make sure cards is following patient
   - Patient should be getting daily EKG
   # LV systolic HF-
   - Echo showed a decreased EF on the patient.
   - Consider repeat echo if unable to wean pt from vent
   - Send mixed venous O2 this afternoon.
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy
   - patient is currently in sinus rhythm
   - SVT improved
 pt had no further issues with SVT overnight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - pt
s beta blocker has been restarted
   #A-fib w/ RVR -Unclear time of onset so rather than cardiovert will
   attempt rate control with Diltiazem.  Etiology could be [**1-20**] CHF/atrial
   stretch.
   - Diltiazem gtt started this AM.  Will follow and ensure BP can
   tolerate.
   - Will also anticoagulate (CHADS-2 = 4points) and her low EF places Pt
   at higher risk.  Will start heparin after PICC line placed and IJ d/c
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure -
   - Baseline creatinine of around 1.4, now at 2.2
   - This renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion/hypotension and
   critical illness
   - pt had a urine output of ~2 L yesterday
   - continue to monitor urinue output, BUN, and creatinine
   .
   # DM type 2 -
   - insulin drip was stopped yesterday morning and pt was put on sliding
   scale insulin
   - blood sugars have been well-controlled with sliding scale insulin
   - will continue to monitor BS
   .
   # AG acidosis -
   - AG is not within normal limits
   - continue to follow electrolytes daily
   .
   # Transaminitis -
   - likely secondary to hypotension/hypoperfusion and critical illness
   - AST and ALT peaked and are trending down; AP continues to be slightly
   elevated, so will follow
   - coag
s are now WNL
   - continue to monitor AST, ALT, and coags
   - abdominal u/s
 trace fluid in the RUQ, otherwise unremarkable
   .
   # Leg pain
   - pt had been complaining of L knee prior to this admission
 result of
   arthrocentesis were consistent with arthritis
   - obtain repeat films of the L knee and refer for PT once extubated out
   of the ICU
   .
   # FEN: Starting TF
s today.  Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   [**Name (NI) 156**] status: Full code
   Disposition: MICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidemia. The patient presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardia with likely supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), leukocytosis, and air space opacities on chest X-ray. These findings are concerning for distributive shock and possible urosepsis.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to CHF, but there is also a possibility of infection or stress reaction contributing to the leukocytosis. The air space opacities on the chest X-ray could indicate pneumonia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, specifically ciprofloxacin, based on the sensitivity results from the urine culture obtained at the outside hospital.

The patient has a history of CAD and presented with elevated troponin levels in the setting of SVT with aberrancy and shock at the outside hospital. However, per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has been restarted on her beta blocker and statin medications.

The patient's left ventricular systolic heart failure is indicated by the decreased ejection fraction seen on the echocardiogram"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, and presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardia with likely supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy, reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, airspace opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to CHF. However, she also has leukocytosis that could be due to infection or stress reaction. The patient needs to continue being monitored for any signs of worsening respiratory failure.

2. Urosepsis: The patient has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) as indicated by the presence of E. coli and klebsiella in the urine culture. These bacteria are sensitive to ciprofloxacin, so the patient is being continued on ciprofloxacin. However, it is important to follow up with blood and sputum cultures to rule out any other potential infections.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and presented with elevated troponin in the setting of SVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation,
   tachycardic with likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF,
   leukocytosis, air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension
   concerning for distributive shock
   # Repiratory failure -  Pt
s respiratory failure is likely secondary to
   CHF.  However, she does also have a leukocytosis that could be due to
   infection or stress reaction.
   - Continue to trend WBC
 WBC down from 15.9->10.3 today.
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood Cx as urine Cx from admission
   are negative and OSH Cx showed only e.coli/klebsiella both sensitive to
   Cipro.
   - Resume attempts to wean ventilator today by switching patient to
   pressure support
   -Patient needs to get a current ABG
   # Urosepsis
 was able to obtain cultures form OSH, which showed only
   e.coli/klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin
   - will continue patient on ciprofloxacin
   - Urine cultures from [**Hospital1 5**] [**6-13**] and [**6-14**] both negative
   - Follow up blood and sputum cultures
 prelim sputum gram stain showed
   no organism
   # Coronary artery disease
 pt has a history of CAD and presented
   elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH.
   Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS.
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - Pt was restarted on her beta blocker Monday.  Currently on metoprolol
   25 mg TID.  Will continue to monitor BP and HR.
   - Make sure cards is following patient
   - Patient should be getting daily EKG
   # LV systolic HF-
   - Echo showed a decreased EF on the patient.
   - Consider repeat echo once patient is stable to evaluate for residual
   effects
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy
   - patient is currently in sinus rhythm
   - SVT improved
 pt had no further issues with SVT overnight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - pt
s beta blocker has been restarted
   #A-fib w/ RVR -Unclear time of onset so rather than cardiovert will
   attempt rate control with Diltiazem.  Etiology could be [**1-20**] CHF/atrial
   stretch.
   - Diltiazem gtt started this AM.  Will follow and ensure BP can
   tolerate.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure -
   - Baseline creatinine of around 1.4, now at 2.2
   - This renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion/hypotension and
   critical illness
   - pt had a urine output of ~2 L yesterday
   - continue to monitor urinue output, BUN, and creatinine
   .
   # DM type 2 -
   - insulin drip was stopped yesterday morning and pt was put on sliding
   scale insulin
   - blood sugars have been well-controlled with sliding scale insulin
   - will continue to monitor BS
   .
   # AG acidosis -
   - AG is not within normal limits
   - continue to follow electrolytes daily
   .
   # Transaminitis -
   - likely secondary to hypotension/hypoperfusion and critical illness
   - AST and ALT peaked and are trending down; AP continues to be slightly
   elevated, so will follow
   - coag
s are now WNL
   - continue to monitor AST, ALT, and coags
   - abdominal u/s
 trace fluid in the RUQ, otherwise unremarkable
   .
   # Leg pain
   - pt had been complaining of L knee prior to this admission
 result of
   arthrocentesis were consistent with arthritis
   - obtain repeat films of the L knee and refer for PT once extubated out
   of the ICU
   .
   # FEN: Starting TF
s today.  Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation,
   tachycardic with likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF,
   leukocytosis, air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension
   concerning for distributive shock
   # Repiratory failure -  Pt
s respiratory failure is likely secondary to
   CHF.  However, she does also have a leukocytosis that could be due to
   infection or stress reaction.
   - Trend WBC
 considering the patient
s increased WBC today, we will
   restart her on her full antibiotic regimen that was d/c
ed yesterday
   (vanc, zosyn, and cipro)
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Resume attempts to wean ventilator today by switching patient to
   pressure support
   -Patient needs to get a current ABG
   # Urosepsis
 was able to obtain cultures form OSH, which showed only
   e.coli/klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin
   - will continue patient on ciprofloxacin
   - follow up blood and urine cultures from this hospitalization
 prelim
   sputum gram stain showed no organism and one urine culture had no
   growth
   # Coronary artery disease
 pt has a history of CAD and presented
   elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH.
   Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS.
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - Pt was restarted on her beta blocker yesterday.  Currently on
   metoprolol 25 mg TID.  Will continue to monitor BP and HR.
   - Make sure cards is following patient
   -Patient should be getting daily EKG
   # LV systolic HF-
   - Echo showed a decreased EF on the patient.
   - Consider repeat echo once patient is stable to evaluate for residual
   effects
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy
   - patient is currently in sinus rhythm
   - SVT improved
 pt had no further issues with SVT overnight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - pt
s beta blocker has been restarted
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure -
   - Baseline creatinine of around 1.4, now at 2.5
   - This renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion/hypotension and
   critical illness
   - pt had a urine output of 1.3 L yesterday
   - continue to monitor urinue output, BUN, and creatinine
   .
   # DM type 2 -
   - insulin drip was stopped yesterday morning and pt was put on sliding
   scale insulin
   - blood sugars have been well-controlled with sliding scale insulin
   - will continue to monitor BS
   .
   # AG acidosis -
   - AG is not within normal limits
   - continue to follow electrolytes daily
   .
   # Transaminitis -
   - likely secondary to hypotension/hypoperfusion and critical illness
   - AST and ALT peaked and are trending down; ALP elevated today, so will
   keep an eye on it
   - coag
s are now WNL
   - continue to monitor AST, ALT, and coags
   - abdominal u/s
 trace fluid in the RUQ, otherwise unremarkable
   .
   # Leg pain
   - pt had been complaining of L knee prior to this admission
 result of
   arthrocentesis were consistent with arthritis
   - obtain repeat films of the L knee and refer for PT once extubated out
   of the ICU
   .
   # FEN: Starting TF
s today.  Will replete electrolytes as needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidemia. She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardia with likely supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy, new reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, air space opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to CHF, but she also has leukocytosis that could be due to infection or stress reaction. Trending WBC is recommended considering the patient's increased WBC today, and restarting her on the full antibiotic regimen that was discontinued yesterday (vanc, zosyn, and cipro) is advised. Sputum culture, follow-up blood and urine cultures should be sent, and attempts to wean ventilator today by switching the patient to pressure support are recommended.

Urosepsis is a concern as the patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) with E. coli and Klebsiella in the urine, which were both sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Therefore, continuing the patient on ciprofloxacin and following up with blood and urine cultures from this hospitalization is appropriate.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure and NSTEMI. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially improved with noninvasive ventilation but subsequently decompensated and was reintubated. The possible reasons for this could be evolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary edema, or ischemic damage due to weaning attempts. To address potential secretions and treat any evolving VAP, the patient will be placed back on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and the sputum culture will be resent.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has new biventricular dysfunction, which may be related to ACS. The patient is already on aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy. Cardiac follow-up and repeat echocardiography are recommended if the patient cannot be weaned off the ventilator. The possibility of a more acute issue requiring maximum medical management or catheterization is also considered due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels.

3. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient is stable on beta-blocker therapy.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has stabilized today, and urine output should be closely monitored.

The remaining issues are managed by the housestaff, including ICU care, nutrition"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have a history of respiratory failure, NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction), and diabetes mellitus type 1. The patient's current condition includes acute coronary syndrome, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), renal failure, and anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving various medications, including heparin, metoprolol, diltiazem, fentanyl, and others. The patient's vital signs are within acceptable ranges, with a stable heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, troponin T level, and lactate level, along with normal or near-normal levels of other markers. The patient's recent events include urine culture positive for E. coli and Klebsiella, sputum culture pending, and antibiotic administration.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there is a concern for evolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or pulmonary edema. The decision to reintubate the patient has been made due to secretions and potential edema.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's ACS requires further evaluation and management, including possible cardiac catheterization or maximum medical management."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if not properly managed.

2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and unstable angina. There is a risk of further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

3. Seizure: The patient had a seizure episode, and there is a possibility of recurrent seizures if not appropriately managed.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), and there is a risk of worsening renal function or requiring dialysis.

5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), or urinary tract infection (UTI) due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is at risk of developing DVT and PE due to immobilization and critical illness.

7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially considering the patient's history of ACE inhibitors and use of anticoagulants.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, and air space opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is also hypotensive and has a history of an out-of-hospital event (OSH) involving supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. While her respiratory support is resolving, there is a concern for cardiac stunning in the setting of her OSH event (SVT with aberrancy/NSTEMI), dCHF/volume overload, or SIRS/sepsis. The patient is expected to be extubated today, but close monitoring is required.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has new biventricular dysfunction and is on aspirin (ASA), statin, and beta-blocker therapy. A repeat echocardiogram is planned in the next 24-48 hours to assess cardiac function.
3. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient has been on beta-blocker therapy but is still"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch, 115.5 kg male with a medical history of unknown allergies, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. The patient was admitted with sepsis secondary to pneumonia and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He required mechanical ventilation and was subsequently intubated. The patient also had acute kidney injury and required hemodialysis. He was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and received treatment for unstable angina. The patient's condition improved, but he remained in atrial fibrillation. The patient's blood glucose levels were well-controlled, and he received nutrition through a feeding tube. Prophylactic measures were taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has a history of ARDS. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further lung complications.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and ACS. There is a risk of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or heart failure.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute kidney injury and required hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function or the need for continued renal support.
4. Infectious Complications: The"

   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, presenting with
   respiratory failure requiring intubation, now with tachycardia likely
   afib with rvr, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, air space opacities on
   CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.
   1.       Respiratory Failure: has been on PS 5/5 overnight, on which
   she is oxygenating and ventilating well.  , good oxygenation, wean
   PEEP., try SBT and reassess. Volume up will diurese gently since still
   recovering ARF
   2.       CAD: new bivent dysfunction, ASA statin, bblocker, Cards
   follow up, try diuresis today
 may repeat Echo if she can
t wean from
   vent to assess vent function. Check SCVO2
   3.       SVT: on bblocker  but Afib w rvr this AM, so added on Dilt
   drip. Push bblocker, start anti coag since in and out x 72 hours.

   # Repiratory failure -  Pt
s respiratory failure is likely secondary to
   CHF.  However, she does also have a leukocytosis that could be due to
   infection or stress reaction.
   - Continue to trend WBC
 WBC down from 15.9->10.3 today.
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood Cx as urine Cx from admission
   are negative and OSH Cx showed only e.coli/klebsiella both sensitive to
   Cipro.
   - Resume attempts to wean ventilator today by switching patient to
   pressure support
   -Patient needs to get a current ABG
   -Will gently diurese as CHF may represent stumbling block for
   extubation, 40IV lasix and f/u I/O
   # Urosepsis
 was able to obtain cultures form OSH, which showed only
   e.coli/klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin
   - will continue patient on ciprofloxacin
   - Urine cultures from [**Hospital1 5**] [**6-13**] and [**6-14**] both negative
   - Follow up blood and sputum cultures
 prelim sputum gram stain showed
   no organism
   # Coronary artery disease
 pt has a history of CAD and presented
   elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH.
   Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS.
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - Pt was restarted on her beta blocker Monday.  Currently on metoprolol
   25 mg TID.  Will increase to 50mg TID.  Will continue to monitor BP and
   HR.
   - Make sure cards is following patient
   - Patient should be getting daily EKG
   # LV systolic HF-
   - Echo showed a decreased EF on the patient.
   - Consider repeat echo if unable to wean pt from vent
   - Send mixed venous O2 this afternoon.
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy
   - patient is currently in sinus rhythm
   - SVT improved
 pt had no further issues with SVT overnight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - pt
s beta blocker has been restarted
   #A-fib w/ RVR -Unclear time of onset so rather than cardiovert will
   attempt rate control with Diltiazem.  Etiology could be [**1-20**] CHF/atrial
   stretch.
   - Diltiazem gtt started this AM.  Will follow and ensure BP can
   tolerate.
   - Will also anticoagulate (CHADS-2 = 4points) and her low EF places Pt
   at higher risk.  Will start heparin after PICC line placed and IJ d/c
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure -
   - Baseline creatinine of around 1.4, now at 2.2
   - This renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion/hypotension and
   critical illness
   - pt had a urine output of ~2 L yesterday
   - continue to monitor urinue output, BUN, and creatinine
   .
   # DM type 2 -
   - insulin drip was stopped yesterday morning and pt was put on sliding
   scale insulin
   - blood sugars have been well-controlled with sliding scale insulin
   - will continue to monitor BS
   .
   # AG acidosis -
   - AG is not within normal limits
   - continue to follow electrolytes daily
   .
   # Transaminitis -
   - likely secondary to hypotension/hypoperfusion and critical illness
   - AST and ALT peaked and are trending down; AP continues to be slightly
   elevated, so will follow
   - coag
s are now WNL
   - continue to monitor AST, ALT, and coags

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and urine culture positive for E. coli and Klebsiella. The 24-hour events include a change in ventilator settings, initiation of heparin, loading with amiodarone, adjustment of Zosyn dosage, and conversion to sinus rhythm. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. They presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardia likely due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, new reduced ejection fraction, leukocytosis, and airspace opacities on chest X-ray, which are concerning for distributive shock. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include acute respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, sepsis without organ dysfunction, anemia secondary to blood loss, and acute renal failure. The patient's current plan includes weaning off the ventilator, diuresis for congestive heart failure, treatment for urinary tract infection, management of coronary artery disease, and monitoring for arrhythmias and electrolyte imbalances."

   # Repiratory failure -  Pt
s respiratory failure is likely secondary to
   CHF.  However, she does also have a leukocytosis that could be due to
   infection or stress reaction.
   - Continue to trend WBC
 WBC down from 15.9->10.3 today.
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood Cx as urine Cx from admission
   are negative and OSH Cx showed only e.coli/klebsiella both sensitive to
   Cipro.
   - Resume attempts to wean ventilator today by switching patient to
   pressure support
   -Patient needs to get a current ABG
   -Will gently diurese as CHF may represent stumbling block for
   extubation, 40IV lasix and f/u I/O
   # Urosepsis
 was able to obtain cultures form OSH, which showed only
   e.coli/klebsiella in the urine which were both sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin
   - will continue patient on ciprofloxacin
   - Urine cultures from [**Hospital1 5**] [**6-13**] and [**6-14**] both negative
   - Follow up blood and sputum cultures
 prelim sputum gram stain showed
   no organism
   # Coronary artery disease
 pt has a history of CAD and presented
   elevated troponin in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock at OSH.
   Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS.
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - Pt was restarted on her beta blocker Monday.  Currently on metoprolol
   25 mg TID.  Will increase to 50mg TID.  Will continue to monitor BP and
   HR.
   - Make sure cards is following patient
   - Patient should be getting daily EKG
   # LV systolic HF-
   - Echo showed a decreased EF on the patient.
   - Consider repeat echo if unable to wean pt from vent
   - Send mixed venous O2 this afternoon.
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy
   - patient is currently in sinus rhythm
   - SVT improved
 pt had no further issues with SVT overnight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - pt
s beta blocker has been restarted
   #A-fib w/ RVR -Unclear time of onset so rather than cardiovert will
   attempt rate control with Diltiazem.  Etiology could be [**1-20**] CHF/atrial
   stretch.
   - Diltiazem gtt started this AM.  Will follow and ensure BP can
   tolerate.
   - Will also anticoagulate (CHADS-2 = 4points) and her low EF places Pt
   at higher risk.  Will start heparin after PICC line placed and IJ d/c
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure -
   - Baseline creatinine of around 1.4, now at 2.2
   - This renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion/hypotension and
   critical illness
   - pt had a urine output of ~2 L yesterday
   - continue to monitor urinue output, BUN, and creatinine
   .
   # DM type 2 -
   - insulin drip was stopped yesterday morning and pt was put on sliding
   scale insulin
   - blood sugars have been well-controlled with sliding scale insulin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure, NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and Klebsiella.

The patient's current condition shows that they are intubated but interactive, with a fever of 37.2 degrees Celsius and a heart rate of 116 beats per minute. The blood pressure is within an acceptable range at 140/59 mmHg, and the respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation is 97%, indicating good oxygenation. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

In terms of medical complications, the patient has several:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory difficulties, as indicated by their need for mechanical ventilation and subsequent extubation attempts. The plan is to wean the patient off pressure support and perform spontaneous breathing trials to assess their respiratory function.

2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which may have contributed to the recent NSTEMI. The patient is currently on statin therapy and beta-blockers. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram may be necessary to assess cardiac function.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient initially presented with ARF, but it appears to be resolving. Close monitoring of urine output and renal dosing of medications is advised.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type I, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and respiratory failure. He presented to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and Klebsiella.

The patient's recent 24-hour events include a change in ventilator settings from pressure support mode to assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 543 mL, a reduction in the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 10 cmH2O to 5 cmH2O, and initiation of amiodarone for rhythm control. The patient was previously in sinus rhythm but returned to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response despite suctioning efforts.

The patient has allergies to A.C.E inhibitors, Darvon, Atenolol, and Bactrim. He received multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, and tazobactam (Zosyn) within the last 24 hours. He is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 140/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and congestive heart failure. The patient has multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, anemia secondary to blood loss, tachycardia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute coronary syndrome, respiratory failure, type I diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and unstable angina. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 151/70 to 169/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a central venous pressure of 11 mmHg. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.2 thousand/mm3, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 166 mg/dL, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. 

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate an ongoing respiratory failure. This condition can lead to further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They were admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), anemia secondary to blood loss, tachycardia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), respiratory failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), acute renal failure (ARF), and allergies to certain medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 151/70 to 169/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 115.5 kg, and height is 67 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation is 68%, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1,592 mL, output of 3,170 mL, and a negative balance of -1,578 mL.

The patient is intubated but interactive, with an endotracheal tube in place. They have a systolic murmur and bilateral basal crackles on lung auscultation. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is alert and responsive, shaking their head and squeezing hands to command.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress and congestive heart failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently present. The patient also has anemia secondary to blood loss, tachycardia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute coronary syndrome, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure, and other medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/70 mmHg to 169/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, normal blood glucose levels, and other abnormal lab values.

The patient's treatment plan includes managing atrial fibrillation, resolving acute renal failure, treating unstable angina, weaning from mechanical ventilation, and monitoring for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, infection, and cardiac events related to the acute coronary syndrome.

   Echo ([**6-18**]) -The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-6-13**], left
   ventricular systolic function has improved/now normal. The severity of
   mitral regurgitation is reduced.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, presenting with
   respiratory failure requiring intubation, now with tachycardia likely
   afib with rvr, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, air space opacities on
   CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - pt was extubated yesterday.
   - developed flash pulmonary edema overnight
 started on nitro drip,
   lasix bolus, morphine 2mg; also started on BiPap mask with PS 5 and
   PEEP 5
 tolerating well
   - will attempt to wean pt off of BiPAP mask today; however, her sats
   drop when the mask is taken off
   - pt still with some crackles on exam today; more fluid on CXR compared
   to last night
 will give another 40 mg Lasix IV
   - repeat ABG today
   - consider additional Lasix bolus later today if still clinically
   appears to have pulmonary edema
   # Leukocytosis
   - WBC elevated today
 up to 18.5 (from 12.2).  Stress rxn from events
   of last night vs. infection
   - Blood cultures still pending; other cultures negative
   - Pt afebrile.
   # CAD
 pt had new biventricular dysfunction in echo on [**6-13**]
   - pt is on ASA, statin, and a beta blocker
 will transition back to PO
   beta blocker after patient is able to swallow
   - echo showed improvement compared to previous study: new bivent
   dysfunction, on ASA, statin, bblocker.
   # Episodes of Afib and SVT
   - pt is on a b-blocker (IV currently)
   - began loading patient with amiodarone
 should finish load this
   morning
 will need to address PO amiodarone dose
   - per tele notes, pt has been in SR since 4pm yesterday
   - PTT 77.5
 within goal range
   # ARF on CKD - resolving
   - Cr is at 1.6 (almost at baseline of 1.4)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She presented with tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, reduced ejection fraction, leukocytosis, airspace opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was extubated yesterday but developed flash pulmonary edema overnight. She was started on nitro drip, lasix bolus, morphine, and BiPAP mask with PS 5 and PEEP 5. She tolerates well, but still has some crackles on examination. More fluid is seen on the CXR compared to last night. Another 40 mg Lasix IV will be given now, and the patient will receive lasix boluses q8hrs to try to get fluid off. The goal I/O is negative 1.5L, and a repeat ABG will be done today.

   Echo ([**6-18**]) -The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-6-13**], left
   ventricular systolic function has improved/now normal. The severity of
   mitral regurgitation is reduced.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, presenting with
   respiratory failure requiring intubation, now with tachycardia likely

   lasix bolus, morphine 2mg; also started on BiPap mask with PS 5 and
   PEEP 5
 tolerating well
   - wean pt off of BiPAP mask today
   - pt still with some crackles on exam today; more fluid on CXR compared
   to last night
 will give another 40 mg Lasix IV now and will give
   patient lasix boluses q8hrs to try to get fluid off
   - repeat ABG today
   - currently on nitro drip at 1.5
 will put pt on Isosorbide
   Dinitrate 30 mg PO TID with the plan to wean down her nitro gtt and
   transition her to long-acting nitrates for d/c
   - pt has completed a 7 day course of vanc and zosyn, which would cover
   her for HAP
 will stop these abx today
   # Leukocytosis
   - WBC elevated today
 up to 18.5 (from 12.2).  Stress rxn from events
   of last night vs. infection
   - Blood cultures still pending; other cultures negative
   - Pt afebrile.
   - will continue to monitor WBC
   # CAD
 pt had new biventricular dysfunction in echo on [**6-13**]
   - pt is on ASA, statin, and a beta blocker
   - pt passed swallowing study
 will switch her back to her PO
   metoprolol dose (50 mg TID)
   - echo showed improvement compared to previous study
   - on ASA, statin, bblocker.
   # Episodes of Afib and SVT
   - pt is on a b-blocker
   - began loading patient with amiodarone

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and recent respiratory failure requiring intubation. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for flash pulmonary edema, leukocytosis, air space opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock. The patient has undergone several medical interventions, including extubation, administration of amiodarone, nitroglycerin drip, furosemide (Lasix) bolus, and BiPAP mask with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent respiratory failure requiring intubation and subsequent extubation puts her at risk for recurrent respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status are crucial.

2. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of acute dyspnea, crackles throughout the lungs, and fluid on chest X-ray suggest flash pulmonary edema. It is essential to monitor her fluid balance and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further episodes.

3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an inflammatory response or infection. Monitoring of blood cultures and continued assessment of the patient's leukocyte count is necessary to identify and manage any potential infections.

4. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's history of"

   lasix bolus, morphine 2mg; also started on BiPap mask with PS 5 and
   PEEP 5
 tolerating well
   - will attempt to wean pt off of BiPAP mask today; however, her sats
   drop when the mask is taken off
   - pt still with some crackles on exam today; more fluid on CXR compared
   to last night
 will give another 40 mg Lasix IV
   - repeat ABG today
   - consider additional Lasix bolus later today if still clinically
   appears to have pulmonary edema
   # CAD
 pt had new biventricular dysfunction in echo on [**6-13**]
   - pt is on ASA, statin, and a beta blocker
 will transition back to PO
   beta blocker after patient is able to swallow
   - echo showed improvement compared to previous study: new bivent
   dysfunction, on ASA, statin, bblocker.
   # Episodes of Afib and SVT

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), who presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. She now shows signs of flash pulmonary edema, tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, and air space opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is also hypotensive and concerning for distributive shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was extubated yesterday but developed flash pulmonary edema overnight. She has been started on nitroglycerin drip, Lasix bolus, morphine, and BiPAP mask with PS 5 and PEEP 5. She tolerates BiPAP well but experiences saturation drops when the mask is removed. There are more fluids on the chest X-ray compared to the previous night, indicating persistent pulmonary edema. Another Lasix IV bolus will be given, and a repeat ABG will be performed. Additional Lasix bolus may be considered later if clinically indicated.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has new biventricular dysfunction on the recent echocardiogram. She is currently on aspirin (ASA), statin, and beta-blocker medications. After the patient is able to swallow, she will transition back to oral medications,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of difficulty swallowing after extubation. The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but has been extubated. The patient's Hct dropped, and guaiac negative. The patient experienced desaturation to the low 90's/upper 80's, increased work of breathing, wheezing on exam, and crackles throughout. The patient was given breathing treatments and Lasix, and the wheezing improved. The patient then acutely desaturated to the 80's with acute dyspnea, crackles throughout, and was thought to be in flash pulmonary edema. The patient received 40 Lasix, 2 morphine, put on nitro drip at 0.25, and started on BiPAP PEEP 5. A stat CXR showed more fluid, and an ABG showed a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 29, PaO2 of 69, HCO3- of 24, and BE of 0. The patient's O2 sats improved to the upper 90's, and the patient stated that her breathing is improved.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient experienced acute dyspnea with crackles throughout, suggesting pulmonary edema. Treatment included Lasix, nitro drip, and BiPAP PEEP 5.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient experienced acute desaturation and crackles throughout the lungs, indicating possible flash pulmonary edema. This condition requires immediate attention and management.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus rhythm, but there is a history of AFIB. It is essential to monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm closely for any changes.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped, indicating acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Further investigation into the cause of blood loss is necessary, and appropriate transfusion may be required.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, suggesting tachycardia. Close monitoring of the heart rate and rhythm is essential to identify any arrhythmias or other underlying causes.

5. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical response to treatment.

6. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of ACS, unstable angina, and coronary ischemia. Continuous cardiac monitoring and assessment of chest pain symptoms are necessary.

7. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced respiratory failure, which is not associated with Acute Respir"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is trouble swallowing after extubation. The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but has now been extubated. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped, but the guaiac test was negative, indicating no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient experienced desaturation to the low 90's/upper 80's, with increased work of breathing, despite being on BiPAP. Crackles were heard throughout the examination, and the patient was given Lasix, which improved wheezing. At around 2200 hours, the patient had an acute desaturation to the 80's with acute dyspnea, and crackles were present throughout the lungs. The patient was given 40 Lasix, 2 morphine, put on a nitro drip at 0.25, and started on BiPAP with PEEP 5. A stat chest X-ray showed more fluid, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) indicated a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 29, PaO2 of 69, and HCO3- of 24. After this event, the patient's oxygen saturation improved to the upper 90's, and the patient reported improved breathing.

The patient has multiple allergies, including ACE inhibitors, Darvon (Propoxyphene Hcl), Atenolol, Bactrim (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim), and possibly other unknown medications. The patient has been on several antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 143/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 115.5 kg, and their height is 67 inches. The patient has received fluids totaling 1,521 mL (315 mL in the past 24 hours), with a total output of 3,840 mL (710 mL in the past 24 hours). The patient is on respiratory support with BiPAP, with a tidal volume of 475 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 6 cmH2O.

The patient has a systolic murmur heard loudest at the left upper sternal border (LUSB), along with inspiratory wheezing throughout the examination and crackles at the bilateral lung bases. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with present bowel sounds. There is some pitting"

   Echo ([**6-18**]) -The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-6-13**], left
   ventricular systolic function has improved/now normal. The severity of
   mitral regurgitation is reduced.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, presenting with
   respiratory failure requiring intubation, now with tachycardia likely
   afib with rvr, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, air space opacities on
   CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - pt was extubated yesterday.
   - developed flash pulmonary edema overnight
 started on nitro drip,
   lasix bolus, morphine 2mg; also started on BiPap mask with PS 5 and
   PEEP 5
 tolerating well
   - will attempt to wean pt off of BiPAP mask today; however, her sats
   drop when the mask is taken off
   - pt still with some crackles on exam today; more fluid on CXR compared
   to last night
 will give another 40 mg Lasix IV
   - repeat ABG today
   - consider additional Lasix bolus later today if still clinically
   appears to have pulmonary edema
   # CAD
 pt had new biventricular dysfunction in echo on [**6-13**]
   - pt is on ASA, statin, and a beta blocker
 will transition back to PO

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She presented with tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, airspace opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock. The patient was extubated yesterday but developed flash pulmonary edema overnight. She is currently on nitro drip, lasix bolus, and BiPAP mask with PS 5 and PEEP 5. The patient tolerates BiPAP well but has some crackles on exam today, with more fluid on CXR compared to last night. Another 40 mg Lasix IV will be given, and a repeat ABG will be done today. Additional Lasix bolus will be considered later if clinically appears to have pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requiring intubation suggests a high risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The sudden onset of pulmonary edema overnight indicates a potential for recurrent or worsening fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's known CAD and diastolic CHF, along with the recent development of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), urinary tract infection (UTI), and other comorbidities. He presented with flash pulmonary edema, requiring invasive ventilation, but was able to be extubated yesterday. He is currently back on CPAP due to recurrent pulmonary edema. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), type I, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are unstable with tachycardia and fluctuating blood pressure. Laboratory results indicate anemia and elevated cardiac enzymes. Imaging shows pulmonary edema. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent pulmonary edema and need for CPAP indicate ongoing respiratory distress. There is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes suggest myocardial injury, which could be indicative of ACS. This increases the risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and acute kidney injury may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Sepsis: Although the patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), urinary tract infection (UTI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), diabetes mellitus type I, acute renal failure (ARF), and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure.

The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was extubated yesterday. However, he developed flash pulmonary edema and had to be placed back on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The plan is to continue with diuresis and try to wean off bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and nitroglycerin (Nitro) as much as possible.

For coronary artery disease (CAD), the patient is already on aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and long-acting nitrate. The nitro drip will be weaned as possible.

Regarding supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), amiodarone will be started and switched to oral form. Heparin will be continued, and Coumadin will be started.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) which is resolving. The urine output will be monitored, and medications will be dosed accordingly based on renal function.

The urinary tract infection (UTI) is being treated with antibiotics, and the hospital-acquired pneumonia (H"

   elevated or if clinical deterioration
   - will send stool for c.diff
   # Episodes of Afib
   - pt is on a b-blocker
   - amio loading dose continued
 began PO dosing
   - PTT 72.2
 within goal range; continue heparin gtt until INR in range
   - pt begun on coumadin yesterday
 INR is 1.1 (goal INR is [**1-21**])
 will
   up titrate in the next few days if not in range
   # CAD
 pt had new biventricular dysfunction in echo on [**6-13**]; echo [**6-18**]
   reported as improved
   - pt is on ASA, statin, and a beta blocker
   # ARF on CKD - resolving
   - Cr is at 1.5 (almost at baseline of 1.4)
   - Renally dose meds
   # DM type 2
   - on SSI
   # Transaminitis
 likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   - no acute issues

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), who presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, air space opacities on chest X-ray (CXR), and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

The patient has experienced several medical complications during her stay in the ICU. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure. She was extubated but developed flash pulmonary edema, leading to the need for placement on a home bipap regimen. The medical team will continue to monitor the patient's CXR and follow up on her respiratory status.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, which could be due to a stress reaction from pulmonary edema or an underlying infection. Blood cultures from June 13th were negative, as well as urine and sputum cultures. The medical team will continue to monitor the WBC and fever curve, with plans to reculture if the WBC remains elevated or if there is clinical deterioration. Additionally, a stool culture will be sent for Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation and now has tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction, leukocytosis, and air space opacities on chest X-ray. She also has relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure requiring intubation and flash pulmonary edema. She was placed on BiPAP at home but continues to be monitored for potential complications related to respiratory failure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be due to a stress reaction from pulmonary edema or an ongoing infection. Blood cultures from June 13th were negative, along with urine and sputum cultures.
3. Episodes of Atrial Fibrillation (afib): The patient is on a beta-blocker but continues to experience episodes of afib. Amiodarone loading dose was continued, and the patient began PO dosing. PTT levels are within goal range, and heparin was stopped early this morning.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had new biventricular dysfunction in the echo on June 13th, which improved in the echo on"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, presenting with
   respiratory failure requiring intubation, now with tachycardia likely
   afib with rvr, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, air space opacities on
   CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - pt was extubated yesterday.
   - developed flash pulmonary edema overnight
 started on nitro drip,
   lasix bolus, morphine 2mg; also started on BiPap mask with PS 5 and
   PEEP 5
 tolerating well
   - wean pt off of BiPAP mask today
   - pt still with some crackles on exam today; more fluid on CXR compared
   to last night
 will give another 40 mg Lasix IV now and will give
   patient lasix boluses q8hrs to try to get fluid off
 goal I/O is
   negative 1.5L
   - repeat ABG today
   - currently on nitro drip at 1.5
 will put pt on Isosorbide
   Dinitrate 30 mg PO TID with the plan to wean down her nitro gtt and
   transition her to long-acting nitrates for d/c
   - pt has completed a 7 day course of vanc and zosyn, which would cover
   her for HAP
 will stop these abx today
   # Leukocytosis
   - WBC elevated today
 up to 18.5 (from 12.2).  Stress rxn from events
   of last night vs. infection
   - Blood cultures still pending; other cultures negative
   - Pt afebrile.
   - will continue to monitor WBC
   # CAD
 pt had new biventricular dysfunction in echo on [**6-13**]
   - pt is on ASA, statin, and a beta blocker
   - pt passed swallowing study
 will switch her back to her PO
   metoprolol dose (50 mg TID)
   - echo showed improvement compared to previous study
   - on ASA, statin, bblocker.
   # Episodes of Afib and SVT
   - pt is on a b-blocker
   - began loading patient with amiodarone
 should finish load this
   morning
 will need to address PO amiodarone dose
   - PTT 77.5
 within goal range
   - will begin pt on coumadin (5 mg PO daily)
   # ARF on CKD - resolving
   - Cr is at 1.6 (almost at baseline of 1.4)
   - Renally dose meds
   # DM type 2
   - on SSI
   # Transaminitis
 resolving, likely [**1-20**] hypoperfusion injury
   # Anemia
   - Hct fairly stable at 25.5
   - Will continue to monitor
   # FEN: NPO until swallowing study.  Will replete electrolytes as
   needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and presenting symptoms of respiratory failure requiring intubation. She is currently experiencing tachycardia, likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, and air space opacities on chest X-ray. The patient also has relative hypotension, which is concerning for distributive shock.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed flash pulmonary edema overnight and was started on a nitro drip, Lasix bolus, and morphine. She is tolerating well on the BiPap mask with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O and is scheduled to be weaned off it today. However, she still has some crackles on examination, and more fluid is seen on the chest X-ray compared to last night. Another 40 mg Lasix IV will be given, along with Lasix boluses every 8 hours to try to remove excess fluid. The goal is to have a negative fluid balance of 1.5L. Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis will be done, and the nitro drip will be weaned down while transitioning to long-acting nitrates for discharge.

2. Leukocytosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, anemia due to blood loss, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary edema. The patient's current vital signs show a blood pressure of 162/55 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on CPAP. The patient has been diagnosed with several acute issues, including acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including diuretics, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiac medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome puts him at risk for further cardiac issues, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to worsening oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring advanced respiratory support like mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal complications: Acute renal failure increases the risk of electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates a current or recent infection. There is a risk of developing organ dysfunction or multi-organ failure if the infection spreads.

   afib with rvr, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, air space opacities on
   CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - pt was extubated yesterday.
   - developed flash pulmonary edema overnight
 started on nitro drip,
   lasix bolus, morphine 2mg; also started on BiPap mask with PS 5 and
   PEEP 5
 tolerating well
   - wean pt off of BiPAP mask today
   - pt still with some crackles on exam today; more fluid on CXR compared
   to last night
 will give another 40 mg Lasix IV now and will give
   patient lasix boluses q8hrs to try to get fluid off
 goal I/O is
   negative 1.5L
   - repeat ABG today
   - currently on nitro drip at 1.5
 will put pt on Isosorbide
   Dinitrate 30 mg PO TID with the plan to wean down her nitro gtt and
   transition her to long-acting nitrates for d/c
   - pt has completed a 7 day course of vanc and zosyn, which would cover
   her for HAP
 will stop these abx today
   # Leukocytosis
   - WBC elevated today
 up to 18.5 (from 12.2).  Stress rxn from events
   of last night vs. infection
   - Blood cultures still pending; other cultures negative
   - Pt afebrile.
   - will continue to monitor WBC
   # CAD
 pt had new biventricular dysfunction in echo on [**6-13**]
   - pt is on ASA, statin, and a beta blocker
   - pt passed swallowing study
 will switch her back to her PO
   metoprolol dose (50 mg TID)
   - echo showed improvement compared to previous study
   - on ASA, statin, bblocker.
   # Episodes of Afib and SVT
   - pt is on a b-blocker
   - began loading patient with amiodarone
 should finish load this
   morning
 will need to address PO amiodarone dose
   - PTT 77.5
 within goal range
   - will begin pt on coumadin (5 mg PO daily)
   # ARF on CKD - resolving
   - Cr is at 1.6 (almost at baseline of 1.4)
   - Renally dose meds
   # DM type 2
   - on SSI
   # Transaminitis
 resolving, likely [**1-20**] hypoperfusion injury
   # Anemia
   - Hct fairly stable at 25.5
   - Will continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and other comorbidities. She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation and now shows signs of tachycardia, likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, airspace opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension, suggesting distributive shock.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed flash pulmonary edema overnight, leading to respiratory failure. She was extubated yesterday but re-intubated due to the edema. She is currently on bipap support and receiving lasix boluses to manage fluid accumulation.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has episodes of AFib and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She is on a beta-blocker and being loaded with amiodarone.

3. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has new biventricular dysfunction seen in the echocardiogram on [**6-13**]. She is on aspirin (ASA), statin, and a beta-blocker for CAD management.

4. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient's blood cultures are pending, her elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), who presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. She is now experiencing tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, air space opacities on chest X-ray (CXR), and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation levels. It is important to ensure that the Bipap therapy is effective in providing adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or stress reaction. Monitoring the WBC count and fever curve is crucial to determine if further investigation or treatment for infection is necessary.
3. Episodes of Afib: Despite being on beta-blockers, the patient continues to have episodes of atrial fibrillation. Monitoring the heart rhythm and adjusting the amiodarone dosage may be required to maintain a regular heart rate.
4. CAD: The patient's new biventricular dysfunction suggests worsening cardiac function. Close monitoring of the echocardiogram results and adjustment of medications such as ASA, statin, and beta-blockers may be necessary to manage CAD.
5. ARF on CKD -"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent presentation of respiratory failure requiring intubation. She now presents with tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, and air space opacities on chest X-ray, concerning for distributive shock.

The patient has a history of CAD, diastolic CHF, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). She also has acute kidney injury (ARF) that is resolving, transaminitis, anemia, and is on chronic hemodialysis (FEN).

The patient's current medications include anticoagulants, beta blockers, statins, and antiplatelet agents. She is also receiving diuretics, vasodilators, and antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient previously required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrence, especially considering the presence of leukocytosis and air space opacities on CXR.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has known CAD and diastolic CHF, and recent findings indicate reduced EF and afib with rvr. These"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type I, acute coronary syndrome, renal failure, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, anemia secondary to blood loss, and pulmonary edema. The patient has been receiving various medications, including A.C.E inhibitors, Darvon, atenolol, Bactrim, heparin sodium, furosemide, and others. The patient was placed on non-invasive ventilation but it was discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory symptoms and fluid balance data suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation is necessary to assess the progression of this condition.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm, but there is a history of atrial fibrillation. Continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rate and rhythm is essential to detect any recurrence or complications related to atrial fibrillation.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Frequent assessment of the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is required to monitor the severity and progression of anemia.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, indicating tachycardia. Regular monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary to identify"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She presented with tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, air space opacities on chest X-ray, and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure requiring intubation and developed flash pulmonary edema after extubation. It is important to closely monitor her respiratory status and continue to follow the chest X-ray for any changes.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count remains elevated at 17.7. Blood cultures from [6-13] were negative, along with urine and sputum cultures. Re-culture should be done today to rule out any ongoing infection.
3. Episodes of Afib: Despite being on a beta-blocker and oral amiodarone, the patient continues to have episodes of atrial fibrillation. The prothrombin time (PTT) is supratherapeutic, and the heparin drip should be decreased. The patient has been started on coumadin, but the target International Normalized Ratio (INR) is 1.3, which is not yet achieved. IN"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She presented with tachycardia likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with rvr), reduced ejection fraction (EF), leukocytosis, airspace opacities on chest X-ray (CXR), and relative hypotension concerning for distributive shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure requiring intubation and developed flash pulmonary edema after extubation. She was placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) but stopped working. The patient is currently on CPAP mask with oxygen delivery and an ABG showing //25/. Monitoring her respiratory status and CXR is important.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a persistently high white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.7 despite being afebrile. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were negative, so re-culture is planned. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.

3. Episodes of Atrial Fibrillation (afib): The patient is on beta-blockers and amiodarone for rate control and rhythm management. Her PTT is supratherapeutic, and heparin drip can be decreased. She has been started on coumadin,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF), who presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, leukocytosis, and pulmonary edema/infiltrates on chest X-ray. She is currently extubated and oxygenating well on home BiPAP regimen. The patient completed a course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is continuing aggressive diuresis with negative fluid balance of 1 liter over the past day. She has increased beta-blockers to improve cardiac output to the kidneys and continue with hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pulmonary Edema: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. Although she is now extubated and oxygenating well on BiPAP, close monitoring of her respiratory status and chest X-ray is necessary to ensure resolution of pulmonary edema.
2. Leukocytosis with Left Shift: The patient initially had leukocytosis with a left shift, which has partially resolved with a WBC count of 13 (from 17). Blood, urine, and PICC line cultures are pending. Off antibiotics.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has had episodes of AFib. She is on a beta-blocker and oral"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and medications. The patient's chief complaint is atrial fibrillation, but he also has pulmonary edema, anemia, tachycardia, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type I, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 68-127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/36-167/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient has received different doses of lasix and is being infused with heparin sodium. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, and glucose. The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation and is currently on CPAP support. He is also receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and decreased oxygen saturation indicate the possibility of pulmonary edema. This condition occurs when fluid accumulates in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress.

1. The patient has a history of pancreatitis, as indicated by the elevated levels of amylase and lipase.
2. They have acute kidney injury, with an increase in creatinine levels and a decrease in urine output.
3. The patient has anemia, likely due to blood loss from hemorrhage.
4. There is evidence of sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicated by elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels.
5. The patient has acute coronary syndrome, as shown by elevated cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and troponin-T) and symptoms such as unstable angina and coronary ischemia.
6. There is respiratory failure, but it is not related to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. The patient has diabetes mellitus type I, as indicated by high blood glucose levels.
8. There is acute renal failure, demonstrated by increased creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of acute coronary syndrome, leading to myocardial infarction or heart failure.
2. Development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease due to acute renal failure.
3. Progression of sepsis to septic shock and organ dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated congestive heart failure (CHF), who presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and pulmonary edema/infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient completed a course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has been extubated, oxygenating well on home BiPAP regimen. She has leukocytosis with a left shift, which is improving, as well as acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient also has diabetes mellitus type 2, and her transaminase levels are trending down. She has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure requiring intubation. Although she has been extubated and is oxygenating well on BiPAP, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if the pulmonary edema/infiltrates worsen.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has had multiple episodes of AFIB, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart rhythm irregularities.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of pulmonary edema/infiltrates on chest X-ray indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can"

   Disposition:
   Although she feels somewhat better still unclear what accounts for her
   v difficult to control pulm edema. Goal today is to aggressively
   diurese.  Will incr beta blockade to better control rate.  She
   continues to have a high WBC with L shift and v high LDH with falling
   LFTs.  Repeating cx but would have some concern for a lymphoma or other
   process.  Too SOB to lie supine for CT but would scan when her CHF is
   better controlled.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, anemia, tachycardia, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe pulmonary edema and unstable angina.

Recent events include pancreatitis, an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, and a very high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with falling liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving aggressive diuresis to manage her pulmonary edema. Her atrial fibrillation is being controlled with beta-blockers. 

The patient's recent blood work shows anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. She also has elevated levels of amylase and lipase, indicating possible pancreatic involvement.
