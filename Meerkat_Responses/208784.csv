   Assessment and Plan
   60M with h/o COPD, tachycardia and recently diagnosed dilated
   cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) transferred with narrow-complex tachycardia and
   [**Year (4 digits) 281**].
   CORONARIES: CK peaked at 316, now trending down, likely r/t cardiac
   strain from tachyarrhythmia in setting of low EF. No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG. No episodes of CP overnight. Continuing to treat as CAD
   and plan for cath before discharge.
   - Trend CEs
   - Continue ASA and Statin
   - No BB or ACE for now given low BPs
   - Start heparin IV
   - cath when hemodynamically stable, diagnostic +/- therapeutic
   - daily EKGs
   .
   PUMP: Known dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 15%, likely ischemic given
   regional WMAs. Clinically slightly volume up; lasix drip increased from
   10 to 15/hr and he has been putting out 130-180cc/hr since then; will
   likely achieve goal of -500cc by midday.
   - Gentle diuresis for preload reduction and pulmonary edema
   - Wean pressors as tolerated (currently on dopamine and dobutamine) but
   maintain BP support during diuresis. Will try to wean off dobutamine.
   - Echo today
   - Consider Swan for hemodynamic monitoring and better titration of
   hemodynamic meds
   .
   RHYTHM: Has been mostly in sinus tachycardia since admission, with
   pressure support, but with episode of narrow-complex tachyarrhythmia at
   05:25 this morning. Broke with lopressor 5mg x1 but caused low BPs to
   SBP 63. Tele tracings of the event show abrupt transition and unclear
   if sinus vs. afib/flutter. EKGs from OSH show likely Afib vs Aflutter
   with 2:1 block that was refractory to lopressor, adenosine, verapamil
   and converted with DCCV.
   - Defib pads placed
   - Monitor on tele
   - Holding beta-blocker in setting of hypotension
   - Anti-coagulation with heparin gtt
   .
   Respiratory failure: Likely pulmonary edema vs COPD flare vs PNA. WBCs
   remain elevated, red blood coming out of ETT today but remains
   afebrile. Required increase in FiO2 to 60% due to desats to 91-92, not
   in setting of tachyarrhythmia.
   - f/u CXR today
   - Diuresis for pulmonary edema as above
   - Continue mechanical ventilation pending improved hemodynamic
   stability
   - ABG improved from OSH admission, 7.32/39/84. f/u AM ABG. Continue to
   trend and adjust vent settings as needed.
   - No antibiotics at this point
   - No stress dose steroids
   .
   ARF: Baseline Cre <1.0 now 3.0. Likely related to hypoperfusion in
   setting of cardiogenic [**Year (4 digits) 281**]. Urine output responsive to lasix.
   Continue to diurese and follow Cre.
   - Trend Cre
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   Metabolic acidosis: Improving. pH at OSH 7.10, now 7.32. Most likely
   resolving lactic acidosis and ARF in setting of cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   likely improve with improved oxygenation after diuresis.
   - Will trend ABG
   .
   Leukocytosis: likely acute demargination in setting of [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] and
   electrical cardioversion vs acute infection vs steroid-induced
   leukocytosis. Has been afebrile. Given hyperacute rise in WBC (10 at
   OSH ED yesterday), likely not infectious etiology. Given neutrophilia
   vs lymphocytosis, may not all be steroid related. CXR shows likely
   retrocardiac atalectasis but not PNA. Given isolated finding of high
   WBC, likely not sepsis.
   - Trend WBCs and monitor for fever or signs of infection
   - Holding antibiotics
   - No steroids
   .
   Transaminitis: likely [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] liver in setting of hypoperfusion.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology for platelets 125, INR
   1.21. Cannot r/o DIC given multi-organ ischemia and [**First Name3 (LF) 281**].
   - INR trending down, 2.8 -> 2.6
   - Normal fibrinogen, haptoglobin thrombin time
   - f/u repeat coags, platelets
   .
   COPD: Likely not an acute flare
   - Continue standing ipratropium, PRN albuterol but cautious with
   tachycardia
   - holding steroids
   .
   FEN: try tube feeding today, replete electrolytes as needed

   Assessment and Plan
   60M with h/o COPD, tachycardia and recently diagnosed dilated
   cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) transferred with narrow-complex tachycardia and
   [**Year (4 digits) 281**].
   CORONARIES: CK peaked at 316, now trending down, likely r/t cardiac
   strain from tachyarrhythmia in setting of low EF. No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG. No episodes of CP overnight. No known history of CAD,
   plan for cath before discharge.
   - f/u ECHO
   - Trend CEs
   - Continue ASA and Statin
   - No BB or ACE for now given low BPs
   - d/c heparin IV
   - cath when hemodynamically stable, diagnostic +/- therapeutic
   - daily EKGs
   .
   PUMP: Known dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 15%, likely ischemic given
   regional WMAs. Clinically slightly volume up; lasix drip increased from
   10 to 15/hr and he has been putting out 130-180cc/hr since then; will
   likely achieve goal of -500cc by midday.
   - Plan for swan placement and determnation of need for balloon pump
   placement today
   - Gentle diuresis for preload reduction and pulmonary edema
   - Wean pressors as tolerated (currently on dopamine) but maintain BP
   support during diuresis
   - Echo today
   .
   RHYTHM: Has been mostly in sinus tachycardia since admission, with
   pressure support, but with episode of narrow-complex tachyarrhythmia at
   05:25 this morning. Broke with lopressor 5mg x1 but caused low BPs to
   SBP 63. Tele tracings of the event show abrupt transition and unclear
   if sinus vs. afib/flutter. EKGs from OSH show likely Afib vs Aflutter
   with 2:1 block that was refractory to lopressor, adenosine, verapamil
   and converted with DCCV.
   - Defib pads placed
   - Monitor on tele
   - Holding beta-blocker in setting of hypotension
   - d/c heparin gtt
   .
   Respiratory failure: Likely pulmonary edema vs COPD flare vs PNA. WBCs
   remain elevated, red blood coming out of ETT today but remains
   afebrile. Required increase in FiO2 to 60% due to desats to 91-92, not
   in setting of tachyarrhythmia.
   - f/u CXR today
   - Diuresis for pulmonary edema as above
   - Continue mechanical ventilation pending improved hemodynamic
   stability
   - ABG improved from OSH admission, 7.32/39/84. f/u AM ABG. Continue to
   trend and adjust vent settings as needed.
   - No antibiotics at this point
   - No stress dose steroids
   .
   ARF: Baseline Cre <1.0 now 3.0. Likely related to hypoperfusion in
   setting of cardiogenic [**Year (4 digits) 281**]. Urine output responsive to lasix.
   Continue to diurese and follow Cre.
   - Trend Cre
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   Metabolic acidosis: Improving. pH at OSH 7.10, now 7.32. Most likely
   resolving lactic acidosis and ARF in setting of cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   likely improve with improved oxygenation after diuresis.
   - Will trend ABG
   .
   Leukocytosis: likely acute demargination in setting of [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] and
   electrical cardioversion vs acute infection vs steroid-induced
   leukocytosis. Has been afebrile. Given hyperacute rise in WBC (10 at
   OSH ED yesterday), likely not infectious etiology. Given neutrophilia
   vs lymphocytosis, may not all be steroid related. CXR shows likely
   retrocardiac atalectasis but not PNA. Given isolated finding of high
   WBC, likely not sepsis.
   - Trend WBCs and monitor for fever or signs of infection
   - f/u culture data from OSH
   - Holding antibiotics
   - No steroids
   .
   Transaminitis: likely [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] liver in setting of hypoperfusion.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology for platelets 125, INR
   1.21. Cannot r/o DIC given multi-organ ischemia and [**First Name3 (LF) 281**].
   - INR trending down, 2.8 -> 2.6
   - low fibrinogen,  and elevated thrombin time
   - f/u repeat coags, platelets
   .
   COPD: Likely not an acute flare
   - Continue standing ipratropium, PRN albuterol but cautious with
   tachycardia
   - holding steroids
   .
   FEN: try tube feeding today, replete electrolytes as needed
   ACCESS: PIV's, A-line, RIJ. Need to change RIJ CVL.

   ARF: Baseline Cre <1.0 now 3.0. Likely related to hypoperfusion in
   setting of cardiogenic [**Year (4 digits) 281**]. Urine output responsive to lasix.
   Continue to diurese and follow Cre.
   - Trend Cre
   - Renally dose meds

   resolving lactic acidosis and ARF in setting of cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   likely improve with improved oxygenation after diuresis.
   - Will trend ABG
   .
   Leukocytosis: likely acute demargination in setting of [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] and
   electrical cardioversion vs acute infection vs steroid-induced
   leukocytosis. Has been afebrile. Given hyperacute rise in WBC (10 at
   OSH ED yesterday), likely not infectious etiology. Given neutrophilia
   vs lymphocytosis, may not all be steroid related. CXR shows likely
   retrocardiac atalectasis but not PNA. Given isolated finding of high
   WBC, likely not sepsis.
   - Trend WBCs and monitor for fever or signs of infection
   - f/u culture data from OSH
   - Holding antibiotics
   - No steroids

   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   60 yr old transferred with catastrophic deterioration from dilated
   cardiomyopathy with intermittent SVT, hypotension requiring pressors,
   oliguria, increasing oxygen requirement on respirator, liver failure,
   incr INR, incr WBC, persistent pulmonary edema with modest elevation of
   troponin and no gross ischemic EKG changes.
   Physical Examination
   intubated, sedated, cool extremities with mild edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient with life threatening deterioration from cardiogenic [**Name (NI) 281**],
   probably nonischemic.
   Will need support with IABP or better Impella device together with
   pressors and high dose diuretics.
   Will proceed with swan, support device and coronary angiography later
   today.
   Adv CHF consult.
   Prognosis poor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of COPD and recently diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) admitted with narrow-complex tachycardia and hypotension.
- The patient has been in sinus tachycardia since admission, with an episode of narrow-complex tachyarrhythmia at 05:25 AM that converted with DCCV.
- The patient's condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, likely due to cardiogenic shock or COPD flare, as well as acute kidney injury (creatinine 3.0) and liver failure (elevated liver enzymes).
- The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, and there is evidence of leukocytosis, which may be due to acute demargination or steroid-induced leukocytosis.
- The patient has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, with an INR of 1.21 and low fibrinogen, but these findings are not definitive for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient's condition requires support with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or Impella device, pressors, and high-dose diuretics.
- The patient will undergo Swan-Ganz catheterization and coronary angiography later today.
- Prognosis is poor, and the patient has been discussed with the family. Full code status has been established."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a likely transplant candidate with a history of one vessel disease of the RCA. They underwent cardiac catheterization and had an Impella device placed. The patient's heart function is compromised, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. They have been responding well to diuretics and are now on an Impella pump. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is at 7.30, indicating poor oxygen utilization. 

The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with persistent respiratory failure. Their ABG results show a pH of 7.34, suggesting metabolic acidosis. They have been on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 set at 60%. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, but they are afebrile. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, with an increase in serum creatinine (Cr) from baseline <1.0 to 4.3. This is likely due to hypoperfusion secondary to cardiogenic shock. Urine output has been responsive to diuretics. 

The patient has metabolic acidosis with an initial pH of 7.10, which is now improving. This could be resolving lactic acidosis and acute renal failure (ARF) in the setting of cardiogenic shock. 

Leukocytosis is present, but trending down. This could be due to acute demargination in the setting of electrical cardio"

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continues complicated course after Impella insertion and cardiac cath
   yesterday.
   Concern regarding persistent low BP, rapid HR at 130-140 with Aflutter,
   poor renal function, upper GI bleeding.
   ASD noted on echo.
   Physical Examination
   warmer extremities, doppler pulses positive
   Medical Decision Making
   Will discuss plans with EP re restoring NSR with cardioversion, beta
   blockers and possibly Amiodarone.
   Will consult renal re renal failure while continue diuresis.
   Heparin, ASA, and neo.
   Will repeat echo to reassess LV size on Impella and may consider TEE to
   assess ASD and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5626**].

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of cardiac issues. They have been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure and had an Impella device placed. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, and their heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient has renal failure, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy. They also have a history of COPD and a potential ASD (atrial septal defect). The patient's blood work shows elevated creatinine levels and liver function tests. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has received diuretics, inotropes, and antibiotics. They are currently being managed by multiple healthcare providers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of heart disease and recent cardiac catheterization, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock due to impaired cardiac function.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low oxygen saturation suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can be caused by fluid overload or acute heart failure.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which may be due to hypoperfusion or direct damage from the underlying cardiac condition.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis could be indicative of an infection, although further investigation is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on various medications including Dopamine, Neo, Lopressor, Fentanyl, Versed, and diuretics. The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and they are being supported with a ventilator and an Impella device. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and troponin levels, along with abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has also shown a decreased platelet count and increased creatinine level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator, indicating respiratory failure. This could lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low cardiac output and the use of an Impella device suggest cardiogenic shock. This condition can worsen if the patient's heart function does not improve or if there are complications with the Impella device.

3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver enzyme levels may indicate an ongoing infection. This could be a result of hospital-acquired infections or a pre-existing condition.

4. Kidney Dysfunction: The increased creatinine level suggests kidney dysfunction. This can further complicate the patient's condition and may require dialysis or other interventions"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, acute cardiogenic shock, and likely a transplant candidate. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure and had an Impella device placed.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 139 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 107/83 to 91/61 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 99% through an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode.

Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 48/29 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 24 mmHg. Cardiac output (CO) is 5.7 L/min with a cardiac index (CI) of 2.5 L/min/m2. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 72%.

The patient has received various medications including fentanyl, versed, metoprolol, phenylephrine, and Lasix. Blood product transfusions have been administered, and the patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -885 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), lactate, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), creatinine, and troponin-T levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an atrial flutter ablation. The patient has an Impella device inserted and is currently in the ICU. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set Vt of 550 mL, RR of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI deferred due to hemodynamic instability. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, and soft abdomen without bowel sounds. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level of 6.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 154-213 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, likely non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, LV slightly less dilated with improved EF, potential acute tubular necrosis (ATN), thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, improving liver function tests, and malnutrition."

   - holding diuril, cont lasix gtt. Will monitor I/O this PM consider
   increasing gtt
   - will discuss with renal regarding diuresis
   - Monitor hemodynamics
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. NSR in 80s
   - Monitor on tele
   - cont Heparin IV for impella
   - f/u post-ablation CXR
   #Renal Failure: Likely ATN given FeUrea >50%

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Ablation of Aflutter yesterday restored NSR but this AM back in SVT at
   160.  EP involved in efforts to restore NSR with cardioversion
   (unsuccessful) and beta blocker, dig and pronestyl planned.
   Impella now at P6 with good hemodynamics, PA 30/15, when in NSR with no
   need for Neo but significant problems with worsening renal failure with
   Cr 6.3 and significant hemolysis with incr bili.  Overall other LFTs
   better.   Good urine output yesterday, but decr again today.
   Repeat echo results noted with decr LV size on Impella with some
   improvement in EF.
   Physical Examination
   warm extremities, no frank bleeding from groin site
   Medical Decision Making
   Focus of efforts to restore NSR.
   Continue lasix drip.
   Consider decr Impella performance level when back in NSR in effort to
   reduce hemolysis and ?plt consumption.
   Appreciate renal followup.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.

   on:[**2160-5-24**] 10:30 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 15%) who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an atrial flutter ablation. The patient currently has an Impella device in place and is showing improved hemodynamics with slightly improved left ventricular ejection fraction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 97%. However, there is worsening atelectasis seen on chest X-ray.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of cardiogenic shock, and although the Impella device is helping to maintain hemodynamics, there is a risk of further deterioration.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated at 6.3, indicating possible renal impairment. Additionally, the patient has a high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, suggesting impaired kidney function.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may indicate a risk of bleeding complications.

5. Infection: Despite the absence of fever, the patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.2, indicating a possible infection. Further evaluation is needed to rule out any infectious sources.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiogenic shock and underwent an atrial flutter ablation. The patient has an Impella device inserted and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. His blood pressure is unstable, and he requires pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. His heart rate is in the 80s, and he is on a combination of fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 6.3 and a urea level of 52.85%. His platelet count is decreasing, and he has a history of leukocytosis. His liver enzymes are elevated, likely due to a shocked liver. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and low EF suggests ongoing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has an ABG showing respiratory acidosis. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilation settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels indicate renal dysfunction. It is important to monitor urine output, electrolyte levels, and adjust diuretic therapy accordingly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating a risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and absence of fever suggest a potential infection. Regular assessment for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and changes in vital signs, is crucial.
6. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest hepatic dysfunction, possibly secondary to the shocked state. Monitoring liver function tests and assessing for signs of hepatic encephalopathy is necessary.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving TPN, but his nutritional status should be re-evaluated, and tube feeds should be considered if appropriate.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but careful monitoring is required due to his renal failure and ongoing diuresis.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by the healthcare team are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and atrial flutter. He underwent an ablation procedure for AF and was supported with an Impella device. Currently, he is in sinus rhythm after being converted from atrial flutter using procainamide. However, the patient's renal function has deteriorated with an increase in creatinine from 6.3 to 7.1. He also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 67. The patient is on hemodialysis and has a fever with leukocytosis. His respiratory status is stable, but he has an elevated white blood cell count. There are concerns about the possibility of acute myocarditis, toxic megacolon, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's liver function tests are improving, and his coagulation profile is stable. He is receiving nutrition support and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers."

   CI 4, and CO 9L/min currently hyperdynamic. Pt also has ASD but step up
   was mild 75-> 80, and thermodilution CO correlated with Fick equation.
   Although WBC elevated and incr CO do not believe pt septic as pt has

 pt likely had low preload from impella

   -  consulting Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] re: ?cardiac biopsy from having acute CHF
   rising WBC that was responsive to steroids, so far Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] believes
   pt has combination of mixed picture
 chronic CHF from mild CAD, and
   acute CHF from unknown reason
   -  will keep goal I/O even today
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. Pt in AF/flutter yesterday s/p DCCV and
   procainamide. Currently in NSR
   - per EP pt did not receive proper loading dose
 will give another
   proc 500 IV x1

   One thought is that pt may have had acute myocarditis causing dilated
   cardiomyopathy that is steroid responsive. Since pt received steroids
   at OSH for thought to be COPD and stopped steroids here, it could be
   possible that steroids decreased WBC and not that steroids out of
   system WBC now coming up. Pt did have abx at OSH and Cdiff possibility
   checked blood cx x2, and ordered c.diff.

   Hospital on [**2160-5-22**] in persistent cardiogenic shock despite
   pressor support.    Cardiac catheterization showed coronary artery
   disease but reduced left ventricular function was out of proportion of
   the LV dysfunction.  An Abiomed Impella 2.5 device was placed for
   hemodynamic support.  Over the past 24 hours, there has been recurrent
   atrial flutter treated with procainamide but there has also been marked
   improvement of his left ventricular function. His PAD are running 14-15
   mmHg.   His dig level is 3.9.  Given the improvement in his cardiac
   output, we will discontinue the Abiomed device as soon a possible.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%. He presented with cardiogenic shock and was transferred to the ICU. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed coronary artery disease but left ventricular function was out of proportion to the extent of the disease. An Abiomed Impella 2.5 device was placed for hemodynamic support.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient experienced recurrent atrial flutter, which was treated with procainamide. However, there has been marked improvement in his left ventricular function, and his PAD (pulmonary artery diastolic pressures) are running at 14-15 mmHg. His digoxin level is 3.9.

Due to the improvement in the patient's cardiac output, it is planned to discontinue the Abiomed device as soon as possible.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a rise in creatinine from 6.3 to 7.0. He is diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Lasix will not be effective while in ATN, and the patient may require dialysis.

2. Hemolysis: The patient has evidence of hemolysis, with low haptoglobin levels and anemia. This may be related to the use of the"

   -Event in AM: spontaneously restarted rapid AF/flutter to 170. Shock@
   100J returned him to NSR in 70s for about 1 minute, then returned to
   tachycardia. 50J shock had no effect. Decided to proceed with
   procainamide 500 mg bolus +/- another 100J shock, as well as dig
   loading and 12.5mg PO lopressor tid. BP remained stable throughout.
   - Pt reverted back to AF/flutter and procainamide 500 IVx1 was given
   again w/ procainamide gtt - did not convert patient
   - Then tried cardioverting again 1hr after being on proc gtt around
   5pm--> pt back to NSR since then in 70s
   - Dig level therapeutic 1.4
   - At 8pm pt +2L, CVP unchanged, but renal fxn worsened Cr incr from 6.3
   to 7.0. Pt's MAP was 55-60 throught the day. Restarted Neo, and
   increased diuresis- lasix gtt back to 15mg/h with bolus lasix 120mg IV
   x1
   - Hemolysis labs showed haptoglobin < 20 c/w hemolysis. Shock liver
   also contributing since DB was only 4.0 of Total 7.7.
   - Pt's Cr at 11pm check up from 6.3 to 7.1. Also pt was +2L, no change
   in recorded CVP 11 or PAP 34. Since MAPs 55-60, and lasix gtt was
   decreased in AM ---> restarted lasix gtt w/ 120 IV bolus and increased
   back to 15ml/h.
   - At 1am total UOP since starting lasix only 15cc total. --> stopped
   lasix all together since pt in ATN and not being effected by lasix.
   - WBC also incr to 29 -> sent blood cx x2, and c.diff sample whenever

 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC
   A/P: 60yoM with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) s/p cardiogenic shock
   and rapid Aflutter now s/p AF ablation and with impella device.
   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: currently not in shock, good perfusion to LE. Pt
   CI 4, and CO 9L/min currently hyperdynamic. Pt also has ASD but step up
   was mild 75-> 80, and thermodilution CO correlated with Fick equation.
   Although WBC elevated and incr CO do not believe pt septic as pt has
   normal SVR. Pt
s currently has low PA diasystolic pressure suggesting
   low preload.
   -  Will decrease
   LV slightly less dilated and EF slightly improved with impella per echo
   yesterday. Responding well to diuril/lasix, -1.5L
   - holding diuril, cont lasix gtt. Will monitor I/O this PM consider
   increasing gtt
   - will discuss with renal regarding diuresis
   - Monitor hemodynamics
   #CORONARIES: Likely non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
   - holding ASA given plts and bleeding
   - holding statin given LFT
   - holding BB
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. NSR in 80s
   - Monitor on tele
   - cont Heparin IV for impella
   - f/u post-ablation CXR
   #Renal Failure: Likely ATN given FeUrea >50%
   - Renal recs
   - Diuresis as tolerated
   - Monitor Cre
   - Monitor lytes: Po4 7.1, Na 130, K3.7, AG 19 but pH 7.34
   #Thrombocytopenia: Trending down, 104->82->67.
   - Watch for petechiae, signs of bleeding

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who presented with cardiogenic shock and rapid atrial flutter. The patient underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation and was implanted with an Impella device. The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure, atrial flutter, and acute respiratory failure, but not ARDS. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, with a cardiac index of 4 and a CO of 9 L/min, indicating good perfusion. The patient has an ASD with a mild step-up in oxygen saturation from 75% to 80%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and evidence of hemolysis. The patient's platelet count is decreasing, but there are no signs of bleeding. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and the leukocytosis is trending down. The liver function tests are improving, but still elevated. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing diuresis as tolerated, monitoring creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's thrombocytopenia should be monitored for signs of bleeding. The respiratory failure management will continue with the current settings. The patient's leukocytosis should be monitored for signs of infection. The liver function tests should be continued to trend and monitored for hemolysis labs. 

The patient's nutrition plan includes D20 for calories, with a reconsult for tube feeds"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and recent cardiogenic shock. He underwent an atrial flutter ablation and has been placed on an Impella device. The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure, atrial flutter, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, with good perfusion to the lower extremities. However, there are concerns regarding potential medical complications such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN), thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and urine output indicate possible ATN. Monitoring of renal function and adjusting diuretic therapy will be crucial.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of petechiae or other bleeding manifestations is necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response or infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and considering appropriate antibiotic therapy is important.
4. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, and phosphate levels. Close monitoring and correction of electrolytes are necessary to avoid complications.
5. Elevated Liver Enzymes: The patient's liver enzyme levels"

   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: currently not in shock, good perfusion to LE. Pt
   CI 4, and CO 9L/min currently hyperdynamic. Pt also has ASD but step up
   was mild 75-> 80, and thermodilution CO correlated with Fick equation.
   Although WBC elevated and incr CO do not believe pt septic as pt has

   low preload.
   -  titrated down performance level of impella and still has good CO
   -  new echo prelim shows normal EF
 will f/u final read
   -  will take out impela today
 pt likely had low preload from impella

   -  will keep goal I/O even today
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. Pt in AF/flutter yesterday s/p DCCV and
   procainamide. Currently in NSR
   - per EP pt did not receive proper loading dose
 will give another
   proc 500 IV x1
   - will check procainamide level
   - obtain EKG since getting anti-arrhythmic
   # CORONARIES: Likely non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD mild - 1V dz of

   holding BB
   #  Leukocytosis- rising WBC from 18
 29
 34. Pt afebrile. Overnight
   when WBC found to be 29. Pt does not have obvious source of infection.
   One thought is that pt may have had acute myocarditis causing dilated
   cardiomyopathy that is steroid responsive. Since pt received steroids
   at OSH for thought to be COPD and stopped steroids here, it could be
   possible that steroids decreased WBC and not that steroids out of
   system WBC now coming up. Pt did have abx at OSH and Cdiff possibility
   checked blood cx x2, and ordered c.diff.
   - will CIS
   - KUB for e/o toxic megacolon
   - sending UA/Ucx
   - assess for VAP with new CXR
   # Acute Renal Failure: ATN given FeUrea >50%. Since pt
s shock liver
   improving and good MAPs not the case that pt has low renal perfusion.
   Lasix will not help while in ATN
   - no further lasix, or IVF currently to keep IVF even while in ATN
   - will need diuresis
 Renal will place dialysis line via IR tomorrow

   tomorrow, otherwise transfuse if plt <20. Anemia has hemolysis
   component, stable, transfuse if < 21.
   - Watch for petechiae, signs of bleeding
   - Hct stable so far
   # Shock liver- AST/ALT cont to improve. Now that pt has good perfusion
   expect recovery
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure:  7.34/44/108/25. Stable, unchanged vent settings

   - if continues to improve may try to wean as tolerated
   # Mental status- off sedation now, not responsive. Papillary reflex
   intact. In setting of Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor mental status
   likely due to decr metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and recent cardiogenic shock. He underwent an atrial flutter ablation and was supported with an Impella device. The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and shock liver. His white blood cell count has been rising, and there are concerns about possible infections or inflammatory conditions such as myocarditis.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This is indicated by a rising creatinine level from 6.3 to 7.1 and oliguria (low urine output). The patient will require dialysis to manage his renal failure.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient had atrial flutter that was treated with cardioversion and procainamide. He is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).
3. Shock Liver: The patient's liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are elevated, suggesting liver injury. However, they are improving now that the patient has good perfusion.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been steadily rising, indicating an inflammatory response. Possible causes include infection or myocarditis. Appropriate cultures have been obtained, and the patient is being monitored for signs of infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been"

   -Event in AM: spontaneously restarted rapid AF/flutter to 170. Shock@
   100J returned him to NSR in 70s for about 1 minute, then returned to
   tachycardia. 50J shock had no effect. Decided to proceed with
   procainamide 500 mg bolus +/- another 100J shock, as well as dig
   loading and 12.5mg PO lopressor tid. BP remained stable throughout.
   - Pt reverted back to AF/flutter and procainamide 500 IVx1 was given
   again w/ procainamide gtt - did not convert patient
   - Then tried cardioverting again 1hr after being on proc gtt around
   5pm--> pt back to NSR since then in 70s
   - Dig level therapeutic 1.4
   - At 8pm pt +2L, CVP unchanged, but renal fxn worsened Cr incr from 6.3
   to 7.0. Pt's MAP was 55-60 throught the day. Restarted Neo, and
   increased diuresis- lasix gtt back to 15mg/h with bolus lasix 120mg IV
   x1
   - Hemolysis labs showed haptoglobin < 20 c/w hemolysis. Shock liver
   also contributing since DB was only 4.0 of Total 7.7.
   - Pt's Cr at 11pm check up from 6.3 to 7.1. Also pt was +2L, no change
   in recorded CVP 11 or PAP 34. Since MAPs 55-60, and lasix gtt was
   decreased in AM ---> restarted lasix gtt w/ 120 IV bolus and increased
   back to 15ml/h.
   - At 1am total UOP since starting lasix only 15cc total. --> stopped
   lasix all together since pt in ATN and not being effected by lasix.
   - WBC also incr to 29 -> sent blood cx x2, and c.diff sample whenever

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and recent cardiac ablation. The patient experienced cardiogenic shock and was treated with an Impella device. He is currently in acute respiratory failure, atrial flutter, and renal failure. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation was cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening and may require advanced cardiac support measures.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation. This can lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.

3. Renal failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, with elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.

6. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting possible liver dysfunction or injury.

7. Hemolysis: The patient's hemolysis labs show low haptoglobin levels and"

   100J returned him to NSR in 70s for about 1 minute, then returned to
   tachycardia. 50J shock had no effect. Decided to proceed with
   procainamide 500 mg bolus +/- another 100J shock, as well as dig
   loading and 12.5mg PO lopressor tid. BP remained stable throughout.
   - Pt reverted back to AF/flutter and procainamide 500 IVx1 was given
   again w/ procainamide gtt - did not convert patient
   - Then tried cardioverting again 1hr after being on proc gtt around
   5pm--> pt back to NSR since then in 70s
   - Dig level therapeutic 1.4
   - At 8pm pt +2L, CVP unchanged, but renal fxn worsened Cr incr from 6.3
   to 7.0. Pt's MAP was 55-60 throught the day. Restarted Neo, and
   increased diuresis- lasix gtt back to 15mg/h with bolus lasix 120mg IV

   - Hemolysis labs showed haptoglobin < 20 c/w hemolysis. Shock liver
   also contributing since DB was only 4.0 of Total 7.7.
   - Pt's Cr at 11pm check up from 6.3 to 7.1. Also pt was +2L, no change
   in recorded CVP 11 or PAP 34. Since MAPs 55-60, and lasix gtt was
   decreased in AM ---> restarted lasix gtt w/ 120 IV bolus and increased
   back to 15ml/h.
   - At 1am total UOP since starting lasix only 15cc total. --> stopped
   lasix all together since pt in ATN and not being effected by lasix.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%. He experienced cardiogenic shock and rapid atrial flutter, for which he underwent ablation. The patient also has an Impella device placed. His left ventricular function has improved slightly, and he is currently in sinus rhythm.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to his elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of >50%. Renal function should be monitored, and diuresis should be continued as tolerated. Creatinine levels and electrolyte imbalances should also be closely monitored.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, with values of 104, then 82, and finally 67. There are no signs of bleeding or petechiae, so transfusion is not indicated at this time.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory failure, but he is stable on the current ventilator settings. Monitoring will continue, and adjustments may be made as necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated but trending down. He remains afebrile, and signs of infection should be closely monitored. A follow-up chest X-ray will be performed today.
5. Liver function tests ("

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 60yoM with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) s/p cardiogenic shock
   and rapid Aflutter now s/p AF ablation and with impella device.
   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: ECHO yesterday am demonstrated sig improved EF
   (35-40%) likely [**1-14**] LV recovery with assistance of impella. Impella
   removed yesterday and patient has remained hemodynamically stable.
   However, cont to have worsening renal fct with oliguria. Per heart
   failure team recs we have started high dose steroids for concern of
   giant cell myocarditis
   - Discuss plan for high dose steroids with HF team. Also discuss any
   plans for bx.
   - Repeat an ECHO today
   - Plan for HD today which should improve volume status
   .
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. Loaded with another 500 mg of Procainamide
   yesterday. Has remained in stable sinus since load. Proc levels around
   9.1-9.7 and QRS stable. Plan to discuss starting proc gtt versus cont
   to bolus with EP. Will also cont lopressor TID.
   - f/u EP recs
   - follow proc levels- freq will depend on bolus vs gtt dosing of
   procainamide
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] ECGs
   - holding hep gtt given line placement today. Will restart following
   line.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD mild - 1V dz of RCA
   - restart ASA since plt count up
   .
   # Positive Blood Cx: One out of four bottles positive for GPC
s in
   clusters from [**5-25**]. This likely represents line infection vs
   contaminant. Gave Vanc 1g last night.
   -f/u cx and sensitivites
   -dose vanc with HD
   -will need to change groin cortis
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: WBC ct cont to trend up and is now 46 though he
   remains afebrile. This is likely partially related to high dose
   steroids but given possible bacteremia this could be contributing
   factor. UA with many RBCs and 21 WBCs. CXR from [**5-25**] does show left
   upper lobe opacity.
   - cont Vancomycin for possible bacteremia
   - send sputum sample
   - will CIS
   - f/u urine cx
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely [**1-14**] ATN in setting of cardiogenic shock.
   Plan is for temporary HD line placement today and initiation of HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Hct trending up 32.2 and plt count also
   trending up 62
104. Likely impella was contributing to hemolysis and
   plt shearing.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Shock liver- AST/ALT cont to improve. Now that pt has improved
   perfusion expect recovery
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure:  Stable, unchanged vent settings over last 24h.
   Will attempt to wean following procedure and HD today.
   .
   # Mental status- off sedation now, not responsive. Papillary reflex
   intact. In setting of Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor mental status
   likely due to decr metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs
   - continue to moniter, minimize further sedating meds

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Worsening Hyponatremia: The patient has worsening hyponatremia with a sodium level of 121, which is likely hypervolemic in nature. This requires further evaluation and management to correct the electrolyte imbalance.

2. Line Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for GPC in clusters, suggesting a possible line infection. This needs to be addressed promptly to prevent the spread of infection and to choose the appropriate antibiotic treatment.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguria and worsening renal function, indicating acute renal failure. The plan is for temporary HD line placement and initiation of hemodialysis to support renal function.

4. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count and hemoglobin level, likely due to the impella device causing hemolysis and platelet shearing. Close monitoring is necessary to manage these conditions.

5. Shock Liver: The patient has evidence of shock liver with elevated AST/ALT levels. As the patient's perfusion improves, there is an expectation for recovery.

6. Mental Status: The patient is off sedation but not responsive, possibly due to decreased metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs in the setting of liver and renal failure. Monitoring and minimizing further sedating medications are important.

7. Positive Blood Culture: The patient's blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 60yoM with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) s/p cardiogenic shock
   and rapid Aflutter now s/p AF ablation and with impella device.
   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: ECHO yesterday am demonstrated sig improved EF
   (35-40%) likely [**1-14**] LV recovery with assistance of impella. Impella
   removed yesterday and patient has remained hemodynamically stable.
   However, cont to have worsening renal fct with oliguria. Per heart
   failure team recs we have started high dose steroids for concern of
   giant cell myocarditis and holding off on bx.
   - Discuss plan for high dose steroids with HF team
   - Repeat an ECHO today
   - Plan for HD today which should improve volume status
   .
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. Loaded with another 500 mg of Procainamide
   yesterday. Has remained in stable sinus since load. Proc levels around
   9.1-9.7 and QRS stable. Plan to discuss starting proc gtt versus cont
   to bolus with EP.
   - f/u EP recs
   - follow proc levels- freq will depend on bolus vs gtt dosing of
   procainamide
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] ECGs
   .
   # CORONARIES: Likely non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD mild - 1V dz of
   RCA
   - restart ASA since plt count up
   .
   # Positive Blood Cx:
 cx from 6
   #  Leukocytosis: Patient noted to have [**12-16**] cx  rising WBC from 18
 34. Pt afebrile. Overnight when WBC found to be 29. Pt does not have
   obvious source of infection. One thought is that pt may have had acute
   myocarditis causing dilated cardiomyopathy that is steroid responsive.
   Since pt received steroids at OSH for thought to be COPD and stopped
   steroids here, it could be possible that steroids decreased WBC and not
   that steroids out of system WBC now coming up. Pt did have abx at OSH
   and Cdiff possibility
   checked blood cx x2, and ordered c.diff.
   - will CIS
   - KUB for e/o toxic megacolon
   - sending UA/Ucx
   - assess for VAP with new CXR
   # Acute Renal Failure: ATN given FeUrea >50%. Since pt
s shock liver
   improving and good MAPs not the case that pt has low renal perfusion.
   Lasix will not help while in ATN
   - no further lasix, or IVF currently to keep IVF even while in ATN
   - will need diuresis
 Renal will place dialysis line via IR tomorrow
   - NPO p MN
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Pt has component of hemolysis [**1-14**] impella as
   hapto<20. Plts stable in 60s now.  Will need plts >50 for procedure
   tomorrow, otherwise transfuse if plt <20. Anemia has hemolysis
   component, stable, transfuse if < 21.
   - Watch for petechiae, signs of bleeding
   - Hct stable so far
   # Shock liver- AST/ALT cont to improve. Now that pt has good perfusion
   expect recovery
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure:  7.34/44/108/25. Stable, unchanged vent settings
   over last 24h
   - if continues to improve may try to wean as tolerated
   # Mental status- off sedation now, not responsive. Papillary reflex
   intact. In setting of Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor mental status
   likely due to decr metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs
   - continue to moniter, minimize further sedating meds
   #FEN: On D20 for calories, Reconsult nutrition re: tube feeds; replete
   electrolytes as needed, but no K given renal failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 15%.
- The patient experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an atrial flutter ablation.
- An Impella device was used to assist the left ventricular function, which showed significant improvement in EF (35-40%). The Impella was removed yesterday, and the patient has remained hemodynamically stable.
- The patient continues to have worsening renal function with oliguria. High-dose steroids have been started for suspected giant cell myocarditis, and a biopsy has been deferred.
- The patient's rhythm is stable after the ablation, but close monitoring is required. Procainamide levels will be followed, and further discussions with the electrophysiology team are planned.
- The patient likely has non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with mild coronary artery disease. ASA has been restarted due to the elevated platelet count.
- Leukocytosis is present with a rising white blood cell count from 18 to 34. The patient is afebrile, and no obvious source of infection is identified. Possible causes include acute myocarditis or previous steroid use.
- Acute renal failure is suspected, and the patient is at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) due to recent procedures. Dialysis plans are being made.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 60yoM with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) s/p cardiogenic shock
   and rapid Aflutter now s/p AF ablation and with impella device.
   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: ECHO yesterday am demonstrated sig improved EF
   (35-40%) likely [**1-14**] LV recovery with assistance of impella. Impella
   removed yesterday and patient has remained hemodynamically stable.
   However, cont to have worsening renal fct with oliguria. Per heart
   failure team recs we have started high dose steroids for concern of
   giant cell myocarditis and holding off on bx.
   - Discuss plan for high dose steroids with HF team
   - Repeat an ECHO today
   - Plan for HD today which should improve volume status
   .
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. Loaded with another 500 mg of Procainamide
   yesterday. Has remained in stable sinus since load. Proc levels around
   9.1-9.7 and QRS stable. Plan to discuss starting proc gtt versus cont
   to bolus with EP.
   - f/u EP recs
   - follow proc levels- freq will depend on bolus vs gtt dosing of
   procainamide
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] ECGs
   .
   # CORONARIES: Likely non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD mild - 1V dz of
   RCA
   - restart ASA since plt count up
   .
   # Positive Blood Cx:
 cx from 6
   #  Leukocytosis: Patient noted to have [**12-16**] cx  rising WBC from 18
 34. Pt afebrile. Overnight when WBC found to be 29. Pt does not have
   obvious source of infection. One thought is that pt may have had acute
   myocarditis causing dilated cardiomyopathy that is steroid responsive.
   Since pt received steroids at OSH for thought to be COPD and stopped
   steroids here, it could be possible that steroids decreased WBC and not
   that steroids out of system WBC now coming up. Pt did have abx at OSH
   and Cdiff possibility
   checked blood cx x2, and ordered c.diff.
   - will CIS
   - KUB for e/o toxic megacolon
   - sending UA/Ucx
   - assess for VAP with new CXR
   # Acute Renal Failure: ATN given FeUrea >50%. Since pt
s shock liver
   improving and good MAPs not the case that pt has low renal perfusion.
   Lasix will not help while in ATN
   - no further lasix, or IVF currently to keep IVF even while in ATN
   - will need diuresis
 Renal will place dialysis line via IR tomorrow
   - NPO p MN
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Pt has component of hemolysis [**1-14**] impella as
   hapto<20. Plts stable in 60s now.  Will need plts >50 for procedure
   tomorrow, otherwise transfuse if plt <20. Anemia has hemolysis
   component, stable, transfuse if < 21.
   - Watch for petechiae, signs of bleeding
   - Hct stable so far
   # Shock liver- AST/ALT cont to improve. Now that pt has good perfusion
   expect recovery
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure:  7.34/44/108/25. Stable, unchanged vent settings
   over last 24h
   - if continues to improve may try to wean as tolerated
   # Mental status- off sedation now, not responsive. Papillary reflex
   intact. In setting of Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor mental status
   likely due to decr metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs
   - continue to moniter, minimize further sedating meds
   #FEN: On D20 for calories, Reconsult nutrition re: tube feeds; replete
   electrolytes as needed, but no K given renal failure.
   #PPx: Heparin, bowel reg, PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF 15%). The patient experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation for atrial fibrillation. An Impella device was placed to assist with heart function, but it has since been removed.

The patient's current condition includes worsening renal function, suspected giant cell myocarditis (for which high-dose steroids have been started), and a positive blood culture indicating a potential line infection. The patient's white blood cell count continues to rise, and there are signs of leukocytosis.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, shock liver with improving liver function tests, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and poor mental status possibly due to decreased metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs.

The patient's treatment plan includes temporary hemodialysis line placement, initiation of hemodialysis, continued monitoring of renal function, and discussion of plans for biopsy. The patient is also being loaded with procainamide and will require further evaluation by the electrophysiology team. There are concerns about a potential line infection, and the patient may require sputum samples and urine cultures.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ dysfunctions requiring careful management and coordination of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 60yoM with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) s/p cardiogenic shock
   and rapid Aflutter now s/p AF ablation and with impella device.
   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: ECHO yesterday am demonstrated sig improved EF
   (35-40%) likely [**1-14**] LV recovery with assistance of impella. Impella
   removed yesterday and patient has remained hemodynamically stable.
   However, cont to have worsening renal fct with oliguria. Per heart
   failure team recs we have started high dose steroids for concern of
   giant cell myocarditis
   - Discuss plan for high dose steroids with HF team. Also discuss any
   plans for bx.
   - Repeat an ECHO today
   - Plan for HD today which should improve volume status
   .
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. Loaded with another 500 mg of Procainamide
   yesterday. Has remained in stable sinus since load. Proc levels around
   9.1-9.7 and QRS stable. Plan to discuss starting proc gtt versus cont
   to bolus with EP. Will also cont lopressor TID.
   - f/u EP recs
   - follow proc levels- freq will depend on bolus vs gtt dosing of
   procainamide
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] ECGs
   - holding hep gtt given line placement today. Will restart following
   line.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD mild - 1V dz of RCA
   - restart ASA since plt count up
   .
   # Positive Blood Cx: One out of four bottles positive for GPC
s in
   clusters from [**5-25**]. This likely represents line infection vs
   contaminant. Gave Vanc 1g last night.
   -f/u cx and sensitivites
   -dose vanc with HD
   -will need to change groin cortis
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: WBC ct cont to trend up and is now 46 though he
   remains afebrile. This is likely partially related to high dose
   steroids but given possible bacteremia this could be contributing
   factor. UA with many RBCs and 21 WBCs. CXR from [**5-25**] does show left
   upper lobe opacity.
   - cont Vancomycin for possible bacteremia
   - send sputum sample
   - will CIS
   - f/u urine cx
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely [**1-14**] ATN in setting of cardiogenic shock.
   Plan is for temporary HD line placement today and initiation of HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Hct trending up 32.2 and plt count also
   trending up 62
104. Likely impella was contributing to hemolysis and
   plt shearing.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Shock liver- AST/ALT cont to improve. Now that pt has improved
   perfusion expect recovery
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure:  Stable, unchanged vent settings over last 24h.
   Will attempt to wean following procedure and HD today.
   .
   # Mental status- off sedation now, not responsive. Papillary reflex
   intact. In setting of Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor mental status
   likely due to decr metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs
   - continue to moniter, minimize further sedating meds
   #FEN: D20 stopped given extreme vol overload. Awaiting nutrition recs;
   #PPx: IV Heparin, bowel reg, PPI
   CODE: FULL
   Dispo: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation. The patient had an Impella device placed and showed significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) after its removal.

However, the patient is currently facing several medical complications:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient has oliguria (low urine output) and elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential acute kidney injury or renal failure. High-dose steroids have been started for concern of giant cell myocarditis.

2. Positive blood culture: One of the four bottles tested positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a possible line infection or contaminant. Vancomycin was given last night.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count continues to rise, now at 46.2 K/uL. This could be due to high-dose steroids or bacteremia. The patient remains afebrile.

4. Left upper lobe opacity on chest X-ray: This finding may indicate a lung infection or other pathology.

5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's hematocrit level is trending up, and platelet count is also increasing. This could be due to hemolysis caused by the Impella device.

6. Mental status changes: The patient is unresponsive and has intact papillary reflexes. Poor"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 15%), who experienced cardiogenic shock and atrial flutter. The patient underwent an ablation procedure and had an Impella device placed. Currently, the patient is on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation included cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ failure and poor perfusion.

2. Atrial flutter: The patient was in atrial flutter, and although an ablation procedure was performed, there is a risk of recurrence or development of other arrhythmias.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient is currently on dialysis for ATN, indicating acute renal failure. This can be a life-threatening condition requiring careful management.

4. Positive blood culture: The patient has a positive blood culture indicating a potential bloodstream infection. This requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

5. Line infection: The patient's central line is suspected to be infected, which can lead to serious complications if not managed properly.

6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient initially had anemia and thrombocytopenia, but these conditions are resolving. Close monitoring is still necessary.

7. Hepatic tenderness: The patient exhibits hepatic tenderness, possibly due to shock liver. Further evaluation with RUQ ultrasound"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who presented with cardiogenic shock and was subsequently placed on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has shown improvement in his ejection fraction (EF), now at 35-40%, and has remained hemodynamically stable since the removal of the impella device. The patient also has atrial flutter, for which an ablation was performed, and is currently in sinus rhythm. He is on high-dose steroids for suspected giant cell myocarditis, as recommended by the heart failure team. The patient's renal function is improving, with a decreasing creatinine level. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with a temporary dialysis catheter placed by the renal team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's initial presentation was cardiogenic shock, which can be a life-threatening condition if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to ATN in the setting of cardiogenic shock. This requires ongoing management with dialysis and careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient experienced atrial flutter, which required treatment with an ablation procedure. There is a risk of recurrence or development of other arrhythmias.
4. Line Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for"

   for bx.
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. Was sinus since receiving proc [**5-25**] but in AFib
   this AM with rate around 100. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] yesterday, no more proc or
   dig for now given renal fxn. Will also cont lopressor TID for rate
   control.
   - will titrate to 37.5mg TID today
   - f/u EP recs, consider proc bolus today versus amio given improving
   LFT
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] ECGs

   partially related to high dose steroids and stress demargination but
   given possible bacteremia this could be contributing factor. UA with
   many RBCs and 21 WBCs. CXR from [**5-25**] does show left upper lobe opacity.
   - cont Vancomycin for possible bacteremia for now
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - f/u sputum sample, urine cx
   - send c. diff

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, presenting with cardiogenic shock and acute renal failure. The patient underwent an ablation for atrial fibrillation and had an Impella device placed. He is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and has shown improvement in his cardiac function, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 35-40%. The patient's electrolyte and volume status are also improving.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), but no fever. The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which could be related to the Impella device causing platelet shearing. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, indicating a resolving shock liver. The patient's respiratory status remains stable, and there are no changes in vent settings.

The patient is responsive and off sedation, able to follow verbal commands. However, the patient's mental status is still poor due to decreased metabolism and excretion of sedating drugs in the setting of liver and renal failure. The patient's feeding tube has been restarted, but with caution due to the risk of aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci in clusters, which suggests a possible line infection. There is also a concern for bacteremia, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin.

   Assessment and Plan
   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: ECHO yesterday showed overall improving EF. Pt is
   now on dialysis, with improving lytes and volume status. Currently
   requiring intermittent neo (up to 0.6mcg) for pressure support while on
   high doses of bb. Stopped prednisone as per HF recs.
   - appreciate HF recs
   - follow i/o's on dialysis
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. ECHO yesterday during Afib showed impaired SV
   and EF during beats following short diastolic filling time. Therefore,
   slowing HR to improve filling time is primary goal.
   - appreciate EP rec's
   - Currently NSR
   - Cont lopressor 100 mg PO tid
   - Consider amio when LFTs normalize
   - follow daily ECGs
   - cont heparin gtt
   # CORONARIES: CAD mild - 1V dz of RCA
   - now on ASA, BB
   # Acute Renal Failure: Improving with Cre trending down. Likely [**1-14**] ATN
   in setting of cardiogenic shock. On day 2 of CVVH with temporary HD
   line placed by renal.
   - cont CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   # Positive Blood Cx: One out of four bottles positive for coag- staph
   from [**5-25**]. This likely represents line infection vs contaminant. On
   vanc. 1/4 bottles from sputum + for GNR. Remains afebrile, WBC trending
   down, CXR - for infiltrate, therefore cont only vanc for now per ID.
   Level 15 after 1g Vanco.
   - f/u cx and sensitivites

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation and had an Impella device placed. He is currently on dialysis due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

In the past 24 hours, the patient's left ventricular contractile function has been improving, but there is still impaired stroke volume and ejection fraction during beats following short diastolic filling time. Metoprolol dosage was increased to 100mg TID to slow the heart rate. The patient was put on Neo to accommodate metoprolol, but he had decreased abdominal sounds and increased tidal volume residuals. Lactate levels remained stable at 1.6. Lopressor was given at 5mg IV, but there was no effect. The patient spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm around 9pm and has maintained a heart rate in the 70s. Blood pressure remains in the 120s. The patient is being considered for amiodarone when liver function tests improve. Prednisone was stopped.

The patient is also experiencing micro 1+ gram-negative rods from sputum, which is believed to be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, the patient is afebrile, with a decreasing white blood cell count, and no infiltrate seen on chest X-ray. Vancom"

   Assessment and Plan
   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: ECHO yesterday showed overall improving EF. Pt is
   now on dialysis, with improving lytes and volume status. Currently
   requiring intermittent neo (up to 0.6mcg) for pressure support while on
   high doses of bb. Stopped prednisone as per HF recs.
   - appreciate HF recs
   - follow i/o's on dialysis
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. ECHO yesterday during Afib showed impaired SV
   and EF during beats following short diastolic filling time. Therefore,
   slowing HR to improve filling time is primary goal.
   - appreciate EP rec's
   - Currently NSR
   - Cont lopressor 100 mg PO tid
   - Consider amio when LFTs normalize
   - follow daily ECGs
   - cont heparin gtt
   # CORONARIES: CAD mild - 1V dz of RCA
   - now on ASA, BB
   # Acute Renal Failure: Improving with Cre trending down. Likely [**1-14**] ATN
   in setting of cardiogenic shock. On day 2 of CVVH with temporary HD
   line placed by renal.
   - cont CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   # Positive Blood Cx: One out of four bottles positive for coag- staph
   from [**5-25**]. This likely represents line infection vs contaminant. On
   vanc. 1/4 bottles from sputum + for GNR. Remains afebrile, WBC trending
   down, CXR - for infiltrate, therefore cont only vanc for now per ID.
   Level 15 after 1g Vanco.
   - f/u cx and sensitivites
   - cont daily vanc levels and dose 1g vancomycin today
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: WBC 20.2, trending down, remains afebrile. This is
   likely partially related to high dose steroids and stress demargination
   but given possible bacteremia this could be contributing factor. UA
   with many RBCs and 21 WBCs. CXR from [**5-25**] does show left upper lobe
   opacity.
   - cont Vancomycin for possible bacteremia for now
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - f/u sputum sample, urine cx
   - send c. diff
   - will CIS
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Resolving. Hct and plt stable.
   - cont to monitor
   # RUQ Pain: Withdraws from RUQ palpation, but stable on exam from
   yesterday. Likely hepatic tenderness r/t shock liver. LFTs including
   Tbili are trending down. Still no BMs. Will hold off on imaging for
   now.
   # Shock liver- AST/ALT cont to improve. Now that pt has improved
   perfusion expect recovery
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure: Stable, unchanged vent settings over last 24h.
   Will attempt to begin weaning again today with volume improvements from
   HD. Attempt CPAP trial
   # Mental status- off sedation now and responsive, squeezing both hands
   to verbal commands. In setting of Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor
   mental status likely due to decr metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs
   - continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and a history of cardiogenic shock, rapid atrial fibrillation (AF), and an impella device. He is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate in the 70s, blood pressure in the 120s, and oxygen saturation above 99%. He is in sinus rhythm and has improved left ventricular contractile function. The patient has been weaned off sedation and is responsive with good pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and recent rapid AF, which puts him at risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the ECG and cardiac rhythm is important.
2. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of hepatic tenderness and elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible hepatic dysfunction. Regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is on dialysis for ATN, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. Monitoring of renal function markers such as creatinine and urine output is essential.
4. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for coag-negative staphylococci, suggesting a possible line infection. He also has an elevated white blood cell count and positive sputum culture for gram-negative rods, indicating a potential respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: ECHO yesterday showed overall improving EF. Pt is
   now on dialysis, with improving lytes and volume status. Currently
   requiring intermittent neo (up to 0.6mcg) for pressure support while on
   high doses of bb. Stopped prednisone as per HF recs.
   - appreciate HF recs
   - follow i/o's on dialysis
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation. ECHO yesterday during Afib showed impaired SV
   and EF during beats following short diastolic filling time. Therefore,
   slowing HR to improve filling time is primary goal.
   - appreciate EP rec's
   - Currently NSR
   - Cont lopressor 100 mg PO tid
   - Consider amio when LFTs normalize
   - follow daily ECGs
   - cont heparin gtt
   # CORONARIES: CAD mild - 1V dz of RCA
   - now on ASA, BB
   # Acute Renal Failure: Improving with Cre trending down. Likely [**1-14**] ATN
   in setting of cardiogenic shock. On day 2 of CVVH with temporary HD
   line placed by renal.
   - cont CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   # Positive Blood Cx: One out of four bottles positive for coag- staph
   from [**5-25**]. This likely represents line infection vs contaminant. On
   vanc. 1/4 bottles from sputum + for GNR. Remains afebrile, WBC trending
   down, CXR - for infiltrate, therefore cont only vanc for now per ID.
   Level 15 after 1g Vanco.
   - f/u cx and sensitivites
   - cont daily vanc levels and dose 1g vancomycin today
   - plan to place PICC and remove cordis
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: WBC 20.2, trending down, remains afebrile. This is
   likely partially related to high dose steroids and stress demargination
   but given possible bacteremia this could be contributing factor. UA
   with many RBCs and 21 WBCs. CXR from [**5-25**] does show left upper lobe
   opacity.
   - cont Vancomycin for possible bacteremia for now
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - f/u sputum sample, urine cx
   - send c. diff when has BM
   - will CIS
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Resolving. Hct and plt stable.
   - cont to monitor
   # RUQ Pain: Withdraws from RUQ palpation, but stable on exam from
   yesterday. Likely hepatic tenderness r/t shock liver. LFTs including
   Tbili are trending down. Still no BMs. Will hold off on imaging for
   now.
   # Shock liver- AST/ALT cont to improve. Now that pt has improved
   perfusion expect recovery
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure: Stable, unchanged vent settings over last 24h.
   Will attempt to begin weaning again today with volume improvements from
   HD. Pt is on CPAP
   # Mental status- off sedation now and responsive, squeezing both hands
   to verbal commands. In setting of Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor
   mental status likely due to decr metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs
   - continue to monitor
   - ensure good pain control today
   - try to wean vent
   #FEN: restarted TFs yesterday but continues to have high residuals.
   Follow lytes during dialysis. Repeat suppository today for BM.
   #PPx: IV Heparin, bowel reg, PPI
   #Access: cordis, plan for PICC today

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Maintaining NSR on Lopressor 100 TID.  Intermittently on low dose
   Neo.   Prednisone discontinued.
   Continues on HD but groin line suboptimal and plan resite tomorrow.
   Hope to begin weaning off vent tomorrow when all groin lines out.  70
   cc urine output.
   On Vanc for one + BC which may be contaminant.  WBC decr 20.2.
   Afebrile.
   LFTs better. Echo EF 20-40% depending on HR.
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue on high dose lopressor.   Wean off neo.
   Wean off vent tomorrow after lines resited.
   Continue HD.
   ID opinion re need for Vanc.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and a history of cardiogenic shock. He underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation and had an Impella device placed.
- The patient is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- His left ventricular contractile function is improving, but he still experiences impaired stroke volume and ejection fraction during beats after short diastolic filling time.
- His heart rate has been slowed with metoprolol, and he is also on neo to accommodate metoprolol but has decreased abdominal sounds and increased tidal volumes.
- He was given lopressor IV, which had no effect, and then reverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable in the 120s, and his respiratory support remains unchanged.
- He has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus from a central line, which is likely a contaminant.
- His white blood cell count is elevated but trending down.
- He has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are resolving.
- He experiences right upper quadrant pain, which is likely due to hepatic tenderness from cardiogenic shock.
- His liver enzymes are improving, indicating a recovering ""shock liver.""
- He has stable respiratory failure and will attempt to begin weaning from the ventilator today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and previous cardiogenic shock. He underwent an atrial flutter ablation and was placed on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's condition has shown improvement in heart function and electrolyte levels. He is currently requiring intermittent neoplastic support for pressure control and is on high doses of beta-blockers. Prednisone was stopped as per heart failure recommendations. 

The patient reverted back into atrial fibrillation overnight and was given 5mg IV lopressor and an early morning dose of 100mg metoprolol. An echocardiogram during atrial fibrillation showed impaired systolic ventricular function and ejection fraction during beats following short diastolic filling time. Therefore, slowing the heart rate to improve filling time is the primary goal.

The patient has mild coronary artery disease involving the right coronary artery and is currently on aspirin and beta-blockers. He is also on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for acute renal failure, likely due to cardiogenic shock. A tunneled hemodialysis line will be placed by the interventional radiology team today, after which the temporary line will be removed.

There is a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus from 5/25, which is likely a contaminant. Repeat cultures have remained"

   #PUMP/Hemodynamics: ECHO [**5-27**] showed overall improving EF. Pt is now on
   dialysis, with improving lytes and volume status. Currently requiring
   intermittent neo (up to 0.6mcg) for pressure support while on high
   doses of bb. Stopped prednisone as per HF recs.
   - appreciate HF recs
   - follow i/o's on dialysis
   #RHYTHM: s/p ablation.  Pt reverted back into a-fib overnight, given
   5mg IV lopressor and AM dose of 100metoprolol early. ECHO yesterday
   during Afib showed impaired SV and EF during beats following short
   diastolic filling time. Therefore, slowing HR to improve filling time
   is primary goal.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 15%), who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation procedure for atrial flutter. The patient is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and has multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: This is a serious condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can lead to organ damage and failure if not treated promptly.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by the need for dialysis. Acute renal failure can be caused by various factors such as decreased blood flow to the kidneys, direct injury to the kidneys, or the release of toxins into the bloodstream.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation, an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other heart-related complications.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has mild coronary artery disease involving the right coronary artery. This condition can increase the risk of angina (chest pain) and myocardial infarction (heart attack).

5. Positive blood culture: Although the infection appears to be a contaminant, it is important to monitor and treat any potential bloodstream infection to prevent"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 8120**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Self extubated this AM and maintaining 100% sats.  Oriented X 1.
   Very little urine output and continues on HD.
   Back in NSR.   Lfts better.
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue HD.
   On Lopressor 100 tid.
   Will continue to have EP follow and see if AFIB recurs and may consider
   Amiodarone now that LFTs better.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and a history of cardiogenic shock.
- He underwent an ablation for atrial flutter and is now on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The patient's hemodynamics have improved, and he is receiving intermittent neo for pressure support.
- His rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation (AFib), and he is being treated with IV lopressor and oral metoprolol.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is on aspirin and beta-blockers.
- He has acute renal failure likely due to ATN and is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
- The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and he remains afebrile.
- His liver enzymes are improving, indicating resolving shock liver.
- The patient's respiratory failure is stable, and he is expected to be extubated after the tunneled line placement.
- His mental status is poor, likely due to decreased metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs.
- The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are resolving.
- He has been growing yeast in sputum samples, which is likely colonization.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and atrial flutter. He underwent an ablation procedure for atrial flutter and received an Impella device. The patient is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and self-extubated. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 100/74 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 32.4, but is afebrile. His renal function is improving, with a decreasing serum creatinine level. The patient's liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are also improving. The patient's mental status is alert and responsive, but he is not very communicative. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of cardiogenic shock indicates a possible complication related to heart function.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient had atrial flutter, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat and potentially result in complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient is on dialysis for ATN, which is a condition where the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter waste products effectively. ATN can occur due to factors like low blood flow or exposure to certain"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 15%), who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation for atrial flutter.
- The patient is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and self-extubated.
- The patient's rhythm has been intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib/RVR), but they reverted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) yesterday.
- The patient's hemodynamics have improved, and they are now on a low dose of nebulized epinephrine for pressure support while on high doses of beta blockers.
- The patient has mild coronary artery disease involving the right coronary artery (RCA).
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN in the setting of cardiogenic shock. They are currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with a temporary hemodialysis line placed by the renal team. A tunneled hemodialysis line is planned for today, after which the temporary line will be removed.
- The patient had leukocytosis with a positive blood culture, but subsequent cultures have remained negative. The blood culture results indicate colonization with coagulase-negative staphylococci, which is likely a contaminant. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who presented with cardiogenic shock and atrial flutter. He underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation and was placed on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis. The patient self-extubated and converted to sinus rhythm. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient's white blood cell count has been trending up, but he remains afebrile. He has positive blood cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococci, which is likely a contaminant. The patient's liver function tests are improving, and his anemia and thrombocytopenia are resolving. He is alert and responsive but not very communicative, likely still groggy from sedation. The patient is currently on CVVH for acute renal failure and will have a tunneled hemodialysis line placed today. He is also on heparin, bowel reg, and PPI. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.
2. Increasing white blood cell count.
3. Acute renal failure.
4. Cardiogenic shock.
5. Liver failure.
6. Thrombocytopenia.
7. Anemia.
8. Poor mental status due to decreased metabolism/excretion of sedating drugs."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and atrial flutter. He underwent ablation for atrial flutter and received an Impella device. The patient is currently on dialysis due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and self-extubated. His rhythm has been unstable, with episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR) and sinus rhythm (NSR). He is being treated with IV lopressor and digoxin.

Medical Complications:
1. Dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, leading to cardiogenic shock.
2. Acute renal failure, likely due to ATN in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
3. Leukocytosis with a persistent high white blood cell count, unclear what is responsible for this.
4. Thrombocytopenia with a low platelet count, resolving.
5. Anemia with a decreasing hemoglobin level, resolving.
6. Shock liver with elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), now improving.
7. Respiratory failure, previously requiring mechanical ventilation but now stable after self-extubation.
8. Mental status changes, likely due to decreased metabolism and excretion of toxic metabolites and sedating drugs.
9. Positive blood culture, unclear what is responsible for this.
10. Coronary artery disease (CAD), mild, involving the right"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who presented with cardiogenic shock and atrial fibrillation (AF). He underwent an ablation procedure for AF and also required an Impella device. The patient is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and self-extubated. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate in the 70s, blood pressure ranging from 112/47 to 137/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 100.2 kg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 2321 mL and output of 3682 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1361 mL. 

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, wheezing in the chest, tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), and diminished peripheral pulses. Neurological examination shows alertness and oriented to person but not time or place, with movement of all extremities.

Lab results include leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.2 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, moderately increased creatinine level of 5.3 mg/dL, and mildly elevated glucose level of 187 mg/dL. Other lab values"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including acute renal failure, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, coma, atrial flutter, and altered nutrition. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and medication infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding the presence of diminished pulses in the extremities and the need for further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: Given the diminished pulses in the extremities, there is a possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism. This can be a serious complication requiring immediate attention.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and the presence of fever indicate a possible infection. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can arise from an infection and should be closely monitored.
3. Bleeding complications: The prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of the patient's coagulation status is necessary to prevent or manage any bleeding events.
4. Organ dysfunction: The patient's renal failure and respiratory failure indicate dysfunction of these vital organs. It is important to monitor their function closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The presence of atrial flutter suggests"

Key findings include:
- Vital signs: Tcurrent: 35.9°C, HR: 71 bpm, BP: 111/50 mmHg, RR: 16 breaths per minute, SpO2: 99%
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is hemodynamically stable.
- Fluid balance: Total input of 3,218 mL and total output of 4,097 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -879 mL.
- Respiratory support: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and previously intubated but self-extubated.
- Lab results: Elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and low platelet count.

Assessment and plan:
- Rhythm: The patient remains in normal sinus rhythm and is hemodynamically stable.
- Pump/hemodynamics: The patient continues to require intermittent neosupport for pressure control while on high doses of beta-blockers. The plan is to wean off neo support today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation.
- The patient also has acute renal failure and is currently on dialysis, likely due to a temporary loss of kidney function (acute tubular necrosis) in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
- The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, but trending down, with an unclear cause. There are no signs of hepatobiliary pathology on RUQ ultrasound.
- The patient has mild anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are being monitored.
- The patient's liver enzymes (AST/ALT) are improving, indicating a recovery from shock liver.
- The patient is stable and off sedation, alert and oriented to person but not time or place. They have proximal right arm weakness, which is likely of a musculoskeletal etiology.
- The patient is on a nasogastric diet and receiving nutrition through a feeding tube.
- The patient's current medications include lopressor, digoxin, heparin, and ASA.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure range of 111-130 mmHg and heart rate range of 71-96 beats per minute.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They were placed on a nasogastric (NG) tube and remained in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient has no known drug allergies. They were given infusions of phenylephrine and heparin sodium. Other medications and ICU care details are mentioned in the note.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 36.6 to 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 68-96 beats per minute, blood pressure fluctuating between 111/50 mmHg and 130/60 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's weight is currently 100.2 kg, with a height of 71 inches.

Fluid balance data shows a total input of 3,218 mL and output of 4,097 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 879 mL. Respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation level of 99%. The patient's peripheral pulses are diminished on both right and left sides. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are also provided in the note.

Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, coma, renal failure, atrial flutter, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock. ICU care involves nutrition support, glycemic control, and various lines including a PICC line and dialysis catheter. Prophylactic measures are taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to renal failure and coma makes them susceptible to infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or changes in vital signs, is crucial.

2. Fluid overload: The negative fluid balance indicates that the patient may be experiencing fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent complications associated with fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The presence of cardiogenic shock suggests compromised cardiac function. Monitoring for symptoms of poor perfusion, hypotension, and altered mental status is essential. Immediate intervention may be required to stabilize the patient's cardiac function.

4. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's acute renal failure is indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Monitoring kidney function and providing appropriate supportive care, such as dialysis, is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure, especially with a decreased level"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and previous cardiogenic shock. He underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation and is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient also has a history of self-extubation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/50-130/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. His temperature is slightly low at 35.9°C.

The patient has diminished pulses in his right radial, left radial, right dorsal pedis, and left dorsal pedis. His neurological examination shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. However, orientation to time and place is not present, and there are no focal neurological deficits. The patient has mild proximal right arm weakness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Liver function tests are improving, but there are still elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including hypokalemia and hypermagnesemia. The patient's blood glucose levels are also fluctuating.

Plan:
- Continue lopressor 100mg tid
- Digoxin level elevated at 2.8, already given today and re-check level tomorrow
- Follow daily ECGs
- Continue heparin gtt
- Wean neo today
- Appreciate HF recs from Dr. [**First Name (STitle)**]

- Continue to monitor for improvement and ensure good pain control
- NG diet. Follow lytes during dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and previous cardiogenic shock. He is currently on digoxin, and his digoxin level is elevated. Monitoring his cardiac function and adjusting medications as needed is important to prevent further cardiac complications.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is on dialysis for ATN. It is essential to monitor his renal function and adjust the dialysis regimen accordingly. Ensuring adequate fluid balance and electrolyte management is also crucial in preventing further renal complications.

3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory status is currently stable, there is a risk of respiratory failure due to his previous self-extubation and underlying cardiac and renal conditions. Continuous monitoring of his respiratory function and providing appropriate respiratory support if necessary is important.

4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and a positive blood culture. Monitoring for signs of infection and treating appropriately is important to prevent sepsis.

5. Bleeding: The patient is on heparin, which increases the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation. The patient also has acute renal failure and is scheduled for hemodialysis today. He has been on intermittent neo for pressure support while on high doses of beta-blockers. The patient's recent progress includes sitting up for the first time, urine output of 75 cc over 24 hours, and maintaining sinus rhythm on Lopressor 100 mg three times a day. His platelet count is stable at 83,000. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of cardiogenic shock indicates a potential complication related to the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires hemodialysis and long-term planning for renal management.
3. Positive Blood Culture: The patient has leukocytosis and a positive blood culture, suggesting the presence of an infection that needs further investigation and treatment.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable but there is a possibility of developing thrombocytopenia, which can lead to bleeding complications.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status is improving but there is a concern about decreased metabolism/excretion of toxic metabolites and sedating drugs due to liver and renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and previous cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation and received an Impella device. He is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and self-extubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate between 63-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/47-126/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's rhythm remains in normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight has decreased from 105 kg to 92.8 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,331 mL and output of 4,423 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,092 mL. The patient is receiving heparin and phenylephrine infusions.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and atrial flutter.
- He underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation and had an impella device placed.
- The patient is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and self-extubated.
- His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 107/47 to 126/59 mmHg.
- The patient's respiratory support has been reduced to a nasal cannula.
- His mental status has improved, as he is alert and communicative.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels rising from 2.4 to 3.5, and positive blood cultures.
- The patient is planned for long-term dialysis and may require a tunneled line placement in the future.
- He has mild coronary artery disease and is on aspirin and beta-blockers.
- The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are improving.
- His liver enzymes are elevated, but expected to recover with improved perfusion.
- The patient's respiratory failure has stabilized, and he is off sedation.
- He has mild proximal right arm weakness, likely due to deconditioning or musculoskeletal etiology.
- The patient's nutrition is being provided through a Renal (Full) diet, and he is scheduled for physical therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and recent cardiogenic shock indicate a high risk for recurrent episodes of shock.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient is currently on dialysis due to ATN. This condition can progress and may require long-term dialysis or renal transplantation.
3. Positive Blood Cultures: The presence of positive blood cultures suggests an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has mild coronary artery disease, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating an increased risk of bleeding complications.
6. Liver Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes indicate liver dysfunction, which may worsen if perfusion does not improve.
7. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has stabilized, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if proper ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.
8. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to multiple factors, including liver and renal failure, medication effects, or electrolyte imbalances.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation for atrial fibrillation. The patient also has acute renal failure and is currently on dialysis. Additionally, the patient has a positive blood culture and leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock, there is a risk of further cardiac issues such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure and need for dialysis indicate a risk of ongoing kidney dysfunction or potential kidney injury.
3. Infection-related complications: The positive blood culture and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not managed appropriately.
4. Bleeding complications: The use of anticoagulants like heparin increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering the patient's thrombocytopenia.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of respiratory failure and self-extubation may lead to further respiratory issues, such as pneumonia or airway obstruction.

   # Acute Renal Failure: s/p CVVH, starting HD today. Likely [**1-14**] ATN in
   setting of cardiogenic shock. s/p temp line placed by IR on Friday.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will likely need tunneled line placement in the future
   # Leukocytosis/Positive Blood Cx:  Coming down to 13.9. Heme/Onc has
   been consulted. Unclear what is responsible for this persistent
   leukocytosis. We do not feel this is attributable to the one pos coag
   neg blood cx, also received 3 days vanco. RUQ U/S on Friday did not
   show any hepatobiliary pathology.
   - repeat CBC since all values decreased
   - Heme consult will see this AM
   - cont to monitor WBC ct and fever curve
   - all cultures negative so far
   - send c.diff today
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Hct and PLT decreased again O/N, in setting
   of drop of 3 blood lines.
   - repeat labs for ? lab error
   - heparin has been dc
   - cont to monitor
   - discuss with heme re: HIT Ab
   # Shock liver- Almost normal. Now that pt has improved perfusion expect
   recovery
   - f/u LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure: Stable, now on nasal cannula s/p self-extubation.
   # Mental status- off sedation now and increasingly alert and
   communicative. In setting of Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor mental
   status likely due to decr metabolism/excretion of toxic metabolites and
   sedating drugs. Oriented to person but not to time or place. No focal
   neurological deficits mild proximal R arm weakness, likely of a
   musculoskeletal etiology and deconditioning. Will monitor for
   improvement and arrange PT when appropriate.
   - continue to monitor
   - OOB to chair today
   - ensure good pain control today
   - failed S/S yesterday, continuing NG feeds, S/S will reevaluate later

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**] and Harish.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   More alert.
   Off Neo.
   Poor urine output 44 cc/24 hrs.
   WBC decr 13.5, plt 65.
   Failed swallow test.
   Physical Examination
   minor weakness of right foot dorsiflexion.
   diarrhea
   Medical Decision Making
   Appreciate Heme input re low Plt and incr WBC.
   Hope to proceed with tunneled line soon for easier HD.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and was subsequently treated with an ablation for atrial fibrillation and an Impella device. The patient is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and self-extubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they remain in normal sinus rhythm. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels. They have mild coronary artery disease and a positive blood culture. The patient's mental status has improved after stopping sedation, but they still have mild proximal right arm weakness, likely due to deconditioning. 

The patient's plans include continuing lopressor 100mg tid, holding digoxin due to decreasing levels, and following renal recommendations for hemodialysis and long-term planning. The patient will also be monitored for potential complications such as leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and shock liver. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent leukocytosis despite receiving vancomycin. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this persistent leukocytosis, especially since all cultures have been negative so far. Heme/Onc has been consulted, and repeat CBC will be sent. Monitoring WBC count and fever curve will continue"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent ablation for atrial fibrillation. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to cardiogenic shock, and is currently on dialysis. Additionally, the patient has a positive blood culture, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of self-extubation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock, which puts him at risk for further cardiac issues such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal complications: The patient is on dialysis due to acute renal failure. There is a risk of ongoing renal dysfunction or worsening of renal function.
3. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and persistent leukocytosis. This indicates the possibility of an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a potential risk of bleeding complications.
5. Thrombotic events: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is on anticoagulant therapy, which increases the risk of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
6. Hepatic complications"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation for atrial fibrillation. He also has acute renal failure and is currently on dialysis.
- The patient self-extubated but is now stable on a nasal cannula.
- His mental status has improved, and he is alert and communicative.
- He has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to a lab error or possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- There is ongoing leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count, and the source of infection is unclear.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is on medication for it.
- He has a positive blood culture and is receiving treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.
- His liver function tests are improving, and he is expected to recover from shock liver.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/50 to 129/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%.
- He is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube and is being monitored closely.

   Imaging: CXR PA/lateral [**2160-6-3**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this day, the
   previously
   described opacification along the left mediastinum is again seen. There
   is
   poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm, though this could be due to
   technical factors. Mild blunting of the costophrenic angle is seen
   posteriorly, which could reflect pleural thickening or small effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   60yoM with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) s/p cardiogenic shock and
   rapid Aflutter now s/p AF ablation and s/p impella device, now on
   dialysis for ATN and s/p self-extubation.
   #RHYTHM: Was in NSR for >72 hrs, on metoprolol and digoxin, until 1:30
   PM yesterday when he flipped into Afib with peak HR of 109, from which
   he spontaneously reverted to NSR by 3PM. He remained hemodynamically
   stable throughout.
   - Continue lopressor 100mg tid
   - Hold off amio and observe for recurrence of a fib
   - Dig level rose O/N, cont to hold dig
   - follow daily ECGs
   - hold on coumadin given need to tunneled line placement.  Cont to hold
   heparin for TCP.
   #PUMP/Fluid Balance/ARF: Off neo for >24 hours. TBB positive this
   morning. Will have HD today.
   - follow renal rec
s today for HD and long-term planning
   - consider tunneled line placement given heme/onc impression of WBC
   count as reactive
   - follow i/o's on dialysis
   # Leukocytosis:  Trending down, although CBC results are somewhat
   inconsistent between peripheral vs. picc draws. Heme/Onc suggests that
   leukocytosis is likely reactive and not due to acute infection. Remains
   afebrile.
   - appreciate Heme/Onc rec
   - cont to monitor WBC ct and fever curve
   - all cultures negative so far
   - f/u c.diff sent yesterday
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Plt count slightly up, Hct down vs peripheral
   draw but even vs last picc draw. Heme/Onc impression is that abnormal
   CBC is multifactorial, related to slow bone marrow recovery from shock
   and reactive changes. They suggest that HIT is not a likely etiology
   but suggest d/c all meds that may contribute to thrombocytopenia.
   - heparin has been dc
   - cont to monitor
   # Shock liver- Almost normal. Now that pt has improved perfusion expect
   recovery
   - f/u LFTs
   #Respiratory Failure: Stable, now on nasal cannula s/p self-extubation.
   Continues to have chest congestion.
   - PA/lateral not suggestive of acute PNA
   - per Heme/Onc, can consider Chest CT for occult source if leukocytosis
   does not resolve
   # Mental status- off sedation now and increasingly alert and
   communicative but still AOx1 and with weakness in R foot dorsiflexion
   and R shoulder extension likely from deconditioning. In setting of
   Liver and Renal failure pt
s poor mental status likely due to decr
   metabolism/excretion of toxic metabolites and sedating drugs. Will
   monitor for improvement.-
   - continue to monitor for improvement
   - OOB to chair today
   - ensure good pain control today
   - Continuing NPO with tube feeds, S/S will reevaluate later this week

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 803**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Maintaining NSR except for 90 min of AF yesterday initially at 120 then
   down to 100 with BP maintained off Neo.
   Appreciate Heme input re elevated WBC and low plt w/o evidence of
   infection or HIT.
   urine output 100/ 24 hrs.
   LFT much better, bili 2.2.
   Physical Examination
   more alert
   still with NGT for nutrition
   Medical Decision Making
   HD today.
   Reconsider tunneled line.
   Hold on Amio and anticoagulation for now but may need to be considered
   if AF keeps recurring.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and rapid atrial flutter. He underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation and was placed on an Impella device. The patient is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and self-extubated. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/47 to 138/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has several medical complications including leukocytosis with a WBC count of 25.9 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 29.9%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 112, and renal failure. The patient's liver function tests are almost normal, but there is evidence of shock liver. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and he is currently on a nasal cannula after self-extubation. Mental status is improving, but the patient still has weakness in right foot dorsiflexion and right shoulder extension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation: The patient had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation yesterday but reverted back to normal sinus rhythm. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yoM with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) s/p cardiogenic shock and
   rapid Aflutter now s/p AF ablation and s/p impella device, now on
   dialysis for ATN and s/p self-extubation.

   PM yesterday when he flipped into Afib with peak HR of 109, from which
   he spontaneously reverted to NSR by 3PM. He remained hemodynamically
   stable throughout.

   - follow renal rec

   - consider tunneled line placement given heme/onc impression of WBC
   count as reactive
   - follow i/o's on dialysis
   # Leukocytosis:  Trending down, although CBC results are somewhat
   inconsistent between peripheral vs. picc draws. Heme/Onc suggests that
   leukocytosis is likely reactive and not due to acute infection. Remains
   afebrile.

   - all cultures negative so far
   - f/u c.diff
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Plt count slightly up, Hct down vs peripheral

   CBC is multifactorial, related to slow bone marrow recovery from shock

   but suggest d/c all meds that may contribute to thrombocytopenia.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation for atrial fibrillation. He also has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and requires dialysis. The patient self-extubated and is currently on a nasal cannula. He has been hemodynamically stable and is alert and communicative, although still oxygen-dependent and showing weakness in certain limbs.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock, there is a risk of further cardiac issues such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
2. Renal complications: The patient is on dialysis for ATN, which indicates impaired renal function. There is a possibility of worsening renal function or fluid overload.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to his recent self-extubation and ongoing chest congestion. There is a risk of pneumonia or further respiratory failure.
4. Infection: Despite not having a fever, the patient's leukocytosis suggests an underlying infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate cultures are important.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and it needs to be monitored closely. Further evaluation for causes of thrombocytopenia is necessary.
6. Hepatic complications: The patient has evidence of liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an ablation for atrial fibrillation. He is currently on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis and has a self-extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg and a heart rate of 87 bpm. He has mild blunting of the costophrenic angle on chest X-ray, which could indicate pleural thickening or a small effusion. His WBC count is decreasing, but there is inconsistency between peripheral and PICC line CBC results. The heme/onc impression suggests that leukocytosis is likely reactive and not due to acute infection. The patient's platelet count is slightly up, and his hematocrit is down compared to the peripheral draw. The heme/onc impression is that the abnormal CBC is multifactorial, related to slow bone marrow recovery from shock and reactive changes. They suggest that HIT is not a likely etiology but suggest discontinuing all medications that may contribute to thrombocytopenia. The patient's liver function tests are almost normal, and he is expected to recover from the shock liver. He is currently on a nasal cannula for respiratory support and has chest congestion. The heme/onc team suggests considering a chest CT for an occult source if leukocytosis does not resolve."

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who has undergone AF ablation and implantation of an Impella device. He is currently in the ICU for ATN and self-extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 103 bpm and blood pressure of 107/51 mmHg. He is on mechanical ventilation via nasal cannula.

The patient's recent medical events include going into atrial fibrillation (AFib) at 4:30 AM, which is currently being managed with metoprolol and digoxin. His digoxin levels are elevated, so it has been held for today. The patient is also scheduled for tunneled line placement today and systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin will be started after the placement.

The patient's renal function is being monitored, as he is on dialysis for ATN. His leukocytosis is trending down and he does not have a fever. Cultures are negative so far, and the Heme/Onc impression is that the leukocytosis is likely reactive and not due to acute infection. However, if it does not resolve, a chest CT may be considered for occult infection.

The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are multifactorial, related to slow bone marrow recovery from shock and reactive changes. Heparin sulfate was restarted yesterday, and the patient will be monitored for any"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation. He also has acute tubular necrosis and is currently on dialysis. The patient self-extubated but remains hemodynamically stable. He is being treated for atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and liver dysfunction. The patient's mental status has improved, but he still exhibits weakness in the right foot dorsiflexion and arm. He is off sedation and alert. The patient's respiratory status is stable on nasal cannula but with chest congestion. He has a history of coronary artery disease and is on aspirin and beta-blockers. The patient is scheduled for a tunneled line placement today and will have a nasal endoscopy evaluation later this week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation yesterday and this morning, which could lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient is already on dialysis for ATN, indicating kidney damage. If not properly managed, it can progress to chronic kidney disease or require long-term dialysis.
3. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's abnormal complete blood count (CBC) suggests anemia and throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yoM with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) s/p cardiogenic shock and
   rapid Aflutter now s/p AF ablation and s/p impella device, now on
   dialysis for ATN and s/p self-extubation.
   #RHYTHM: Mostly in NSR, on metoprolol and digoxin, but had 90 min Afib
   yesterday and this AM in Afib 100-110 since 4:30 AM. Remains
   hemodynamically stable off pressors.
   - Continue lopressor 100mg tid
   - Consider amiodarone today if remains in fib
   - Dig level remains elevated, hold dig today
   - start systemic anticoagulation (coumadin) after tunneled line
   placement today
   #PUMP/Fluid Balance/ARF: Neo has been dc'd. Had HD yesterday. Tunneled
   line placement today.
   - follow renal rec
s today for HD and long-term planning
   - follow i/o's on dialysis
   # Leukocytosis:  Trending down, afebrile. Per Heme/Onc leukocytosis is
   likely reactive and not due to acute infection. Repeat C.diff has not
   been sent due to difficulty extracting stool from flexiseal.
   - appreciate Heme/Onc rec
   - cont to monitor WBC ct and fever curve
   - all cultures negative so far
   - per Heme/Onc, if leukocytosis does not resolve, consider chest CT for
   occult infection
   #Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Plt count rising but Hct down today, 26 ->
   21. Heme/Onc impression is that abnormal CBC is multifactorial, related
   to slow bone marrow recovery from shock and reactive changes. Heparin
   sq was restarted yesterday.
   - guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding on exam
   - check PM crit
   - transfuse if hct drops below 21
   - T&C x2
   # Shock liver- Almost normal. Now that pt has improved perfusion expect
   recovery
   - f/u LFTs this AM
   # Mental status- off sedation now and increasingly alert and
   communicative but still AOx1 and with weakness in R foot dorsiflexion
   likely from deconditioning. R arm weakness has improved.
   - continue to monitor for improvement
   - OOB to chair today
   - ensure good pain control today
   - f/u PT consult
   #Respiratory Failure: Stable, now on nasal cannula s/p self-extubation.
   Continues to have chest congestion.
   # CORONARIES: CAD mild - 1V dz of RCA
   - now on ASA, BB
    #FEN: NPO this AM for procedure, otherwise NPO with tube feeds, S/S
   will reevaluate later this week with nasal endoscopy. Follow lytes
   during dialysis.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and a history of cardiogenic shock, who underwent atrial fibrillation ablation and received an impella device. The patient is currently in the ICU for acute tubular necrosis and self-extubation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 107/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is hemodynamically stable without the need for pressors. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obesity, clear breath sounds anteriorly, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and extremities with 1+ pulses. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's alertness and responsiveness. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count with a trend downwards, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results indicate possible electrolyte imbalances and abnormalities in calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management for rhythm control, pump optimization, fluid balance, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, anemia/thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, mental status, respiratory failure, and coronary artery"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and rapid atrial flutter. He underwent an ablation procedure and was placed on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis. The patient also self-extubated. He is currently hemodynamically stable and in normal sinus rhythm. His platelet count is rising, and his hemoglobin concentration is stable. The patient's liver function tests are almost normal, and he is showing improvement in mental status and weakness. However, he still has weakness in the right foot dorsiflexion and chest congestion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable on room air, but he continues to have chest congestion. This may indicate a risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of his current respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and experienced cardiogenic shock. Although he is currently hemodynamically stable, there is still a risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis. There is a potential risk for ongoing renal dysfunction or further deterioration of renal function.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially had a low platelet count, but it is now rising. However, there is still a risk for bleeding complications due to the recent"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 8374**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Failed video swallow so still with feeding tube for most of nutrition.
   Urine output better 250/24 hrs.  Eventual renal recovery expected.
   On HD today thru new tunneled line.
   Mostly in NSR.
   LFTs back to normal.
   Physical Examination
   more alert.
   Medical Decision Making
   OK for transfer to rehab today.
   HD continues.
   Cardiology f/u arranged with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and a history of cardiogenic shock, rapid atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation ablation. The patient also has acute tubular necrosis and is currently on dialysis. The patient's current condition includes being hemodynamically stable off pressors, in normal sinus rhythm since the procedure yesterday morning, and restarted on Coumadin post-procedure.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have chest congestion and is stable on room air. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise or pneumonia due to the ongoing chest congestion.

2. Mental Status/Weakness: The patient is increasingly alert and communicative but still has weakness in the right foot dorsiflexion, likely from deconditioning. The patient's mental status and weakness should continue to be monitored for improvement.

3. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is rising, but the hemoglobin level is stable. The abnormal CBC is multifactorial, related to slow bone marrow recovery from shock and reactive changes.

4. Shock Liver: The patient's liver function tests are almost normal now that the patient has improved perfusion. However, there is a risk of liver dysfunction if perfusion does not improve.

5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has mild CAD involving the right coronary artery (RCA). There"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who experienced cardiogenic shock and rapid atrial flutter. The patient underwent an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation and was also on dialysis for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient self-extubated.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and off pressors. The patient has been restarted on metoprolol and digoxin, and Coumadin has been started post-procedure.

The patient has leukocytosis, but the white blood cell count is trending down, and there is no fever. The patient's platelet count is rising, and the hematocrit (Hct) is stable today. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which is expected to improve with time. The patient's liver enzymes are almost normal, and the mental status is improving.

The patient's respiratory status is stable on room air, but there is still chest congestion. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is currently on aspirin and beta-blockers. The patient is advised to restart a statin. The patient's diet can be advanced to full, and tube feeds"
