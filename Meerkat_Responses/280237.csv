   # GI bleeding: Given age, DM, tenderness on exam, and rectal
   inflammation on OSH CT scan, concern for ischemic colitis, although she
   may instead have diverticular bleeding, AVM, etc.  Had hct 30-
   yesterday got 1 unit pRBC emergency blood overnight with bump back to
   30.   Needs consent from son signed.
   - currently has fem line, will attempt PICC today and remove groin
   line, has one 20g PIV and poor peripheral vasculature
   - serial Hct q4h given hct drop overnight
   - IV PPI
   - GI consult initially recommended bleeding scan and would consider
   scope; given her age and inability to cooperate with nuclear scan,
   prefer empiric management with volume resuscitation, supportive
   transfusion prn, and following clinical exam, given that the leading dx
   is ischemia and this will be the treatment regardless of diagnostic
   strategy ---consult now recommends conservative management, however,
   patient could have bleeding polyp or AVM
 will contact GI to see if
   can get flex sig
   # Acute renal failure: Improved to 1.8 this morning. On admission, Cr
   2.3; baseline 0.7-0.8 at her last admission here in [**2117**].  Likely
   prerenal as improved with IVF
   - f/u urine lytes
   - IVF, transfuse as needed for volume resuscitation
   - trend Cr
   # Oxygen Requirement:  On 2L NC, is up 4.5L since yesterday, crackles
   on exam.  Unknown EF.
   - hold IVF for now as appears volume up
   - can give IVF if needed with close respiratory status monitoring
   # Urinary tract infection: + UA with GNR >100,000 on culture, [**Last Name (un) 46**]
   pending.
   - continue Cipro for 3 days total, last dose today
   # IDDM: restart home NPH 28units QAM and sliding scale (half doses
   while NPO); if fingersticks remain elevated, may need insulin gtt
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.  Was likely  from infection, either UTI or
   proctitis seen on OSH CT scan, vs stress response.

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and dementia, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), dehydration, urinary tract infection (UTI), leukocytosis with bandemia, and hyperglycemia. The patient has a femoral line, which will be removed if a peripheral intravenous catheter (PIV) can be successfully placed. 

The assessment and plan include:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may have ischemic colitis or diverticular bleeding, among other possibilities. She received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) overnight to increase her hemoglobin concentration. Consent from the son is needed for further blood transfusion. The patient will continue with empiric management, including volume resuscitation and transfusion as needed. A flexible sigmoidoscopy (flex sig) may be considered.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level improved from 2.3 on admission to 1.8 this morning. It is likely prerenal in nature and has improved with intravenous fluids (IVF). Close monitoring of urine electrolytes and trends in creatinine are advised.
3. Oxygen requirement: The patient is on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and requires supplemental oxygen. Crackles are present on examination, and her ejection fraction (EF) is unknown. IVF should be held for now, and careful respiratory status monitoring is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, type II, and dementia, who presents with gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, urinary tract infection, leukocytosis with bandemia, and hyperglycemia. She has acute renal failure, tenderness on abdominal examination, and rectal inflammation on CT scan. The leading diagnosis is ischemic colitis, but other possibilities include diverticular bleeding, arteriovenous malformation, etc. The patient is currently on CVL for access, attempting to place 18G PIV, serial Hct, active T & S, IV PPI, and GI consult recommended bleeding scan and scope. She also has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.3, urinary tract infection, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient is DNR/DNI and in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic colitis: The patient's age, diabetes mellitus, tenderness on examination, and rectal inflammation on CT scan raise concerns for ischemic colitis. If left untreated or not managed properly, this condition can lead to further bleeding, infection, and sepsis.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute renal failure. If not managed promptly, this can progress to chronic renal failure, leading to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic symptoms.
3. Urinary tract infection"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and dementia who presents with gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, urinary tract infection, leukocytosis with bandemia, and hyperglycemia. She has a central venous line for access and is also attempting to place at least one 18G peripheral IV. Serial hematocrit and active temperature and blood pressure monitoring are planned. She will receive IV proton pump inhibitor, and a GI consult is recommended for a bleeding scan and scope. The leading diagnosis for the GI bleeding is ischemic colitis, and the preferred management is volume resuscitation, supportive transfusion as needed, and following clinical exam.

The patient also has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.3, which was normal at her last admission. IV fluids will be given, and transfusion will be done as needed for volume resuscitation. Trends in creatinine levels will be monitored.

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection with positive urine analysis, and she is being treated empirically with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Her insulin regimen for IDDM needs to be restarted, and her dementia medications should continue as before.

The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 30 to 26, indicating significant blood loss. He was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells overnight. The patient remains hemodynamically stable but continues to experience hematochezia.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including dementia, diabetes mellitus type 1, acute renal failure (likely pre-renal in nature), and possible urinary tract infection. He is on various medications including antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and antidiabetic drugs.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the bases of the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. The patient is sedated and unresponsive to commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient has an infection in the upper gastrointestinal tract with gram-negative rods, and blood culture is negative for growth.

Plan:
The patient's current plan includes withholding oral intake, following gastrointestinal recommendations, and receiving empirical antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient is receiving volume resuscitation, serial hematocrit measurements every four hours, and blood transfusion to target hematocrit of 25%. All blood thinners have been held. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IDDM, dementia, and diverticulosis, who was admitted to the ICU due to lower GI bleed. The patient's condition has been unstable, with ongoing hematochezia despite receiving blood transfusion. The patient remains hemodynamically stable but has shown signs of increased O2 requirements possibly due to fluid resuscitation. The patient's Hct has dropped from 30 to 26, indicating ongoing blood loss. The patient's ABGs reveal a pH of 7.2, which suggests metabolic acidosis. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for a slightly low Ca++. The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, suggesting acute kidney injury. The patient's glucose level is significantly high at 245. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lower GI bleed: The patient has been experiencing ongoing hematochezia, indicating a persistent bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to further blood loss and potential hypovolemic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABGs reveal a pH of 7.2, suggesting metabolic acidosis. This could be due to lactic acidosis secondary to poor tissue perfusion or ongoing blood loss.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates AKI. This could be caused by hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), type II, and dementia, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), dehydration, urinary tract infection (UTI), leukocytosis with bandemia, and hyperglycemia. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and is currently on hemodialysis. The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and she has crackles on examination. She also has a Foley catheter in place. Her condition requires close monitoring, and she is receiving various treatments including IV fluids, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and medications for diabetes management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic colitis vs diverticular bleeding: The patient's age, DM, tenderness on exam, and rectal inflammation on OSH CT scan raise concerns for ischemic colitis. However, she may instead have diverticular bleeding, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), etc.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7-0.8, but on admission, it was 2.3. It has improved to 1.0 this morning. It is likely prerenal as it improved with IV fluids. Close monitoring of urine electrolytes, volume resuscitation, and transfusion as needed are recommended.
3. Oxygen requirement: The patient is currently on 2 liters of nasal cannula but has increased to 4.5"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes mellitus and dementia, admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), dehydration, urinary tract infection (UTI), leukocytosis with bandemia, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been stable over the past 24 hours with no further episodes of hematochezia. Initially, there were concerns for ischemic colitis or diverticular bleeding. She had a PICC line placed yesterday and her femoral line was pulled. The patient's acute renal failure has improved to a creatinine level of 1.0 this morning, likely due to prerenal causes and improved with intravenous fluids (IVF). Oxygen requirement is currently on 2L nasal cannula. Urinary tract infection is being treated with ciprofloxacin for 7 days. Insulin therapy has been restarted for her IDDM. Leukocytosis has resolved, likely due to infection or stress response. Dementia management continues with donepezil, risperdal, and depakote. ICU care includes nutrition via oral route, glycemic control with sliding scale insulin (SSI), and appropriate line management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and stress ulcer prevention with pantoprazole (PPI). The patient's code status is full code, and she is scheduled to be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient initially presented with hematochezia, indicating lower gastrointestinal bleeding. This condition can lead to significant blood loss and may require further investigation and management.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has experienced acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This can be caused by prerenal factors such as dehydration, but further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and guide treatment.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture for a urinary tract infection. This condition should be treated promptly to prevent complications like sepsis.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is also experiencing hyperglycemia, which can complicate her overall condition and increase the risk of infections and other complications related to diabetes.
5. Dehydration: The patient's initial presentation included dehydration, which may have contributed to her renal failure and other complications. Adequate fluid resuscitation is crucial to prevent further complications.
6. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, which may affect her recovery and response to treatment. Close monitoring and appropriate management of her dementia symptoms are essential.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be required for a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition."
