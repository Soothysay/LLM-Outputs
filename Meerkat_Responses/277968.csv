","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who presented to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has been treated with R-ICE chemotherapy and is currently experiencing fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. Laboratory results show neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient is diagnosed with febrile neutropenia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, lymphoma, and hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover pseudomonas and MRSA, as well as supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to the patient's neutropenia and immunocompromised state, there is a risk of infection. The presence of fever further supports this concern. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential bacterial pathogens.

2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension indicates a compromised cardiovascular system. Aggressive fluid resuscitation has been administered, and vasopressors may be necessary if the patient does not respond adequately.

3. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient is currently without organ dysfunction, her condition can rapidly deteriorate if sepsis progresses. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and organ-specific functions will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who presented to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has been treated with chemotherapy and is currently experiencing a fever. The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature of 102.2°F (39°C), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 103/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her laboratory results indicate neutropenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 18 K/uL. She has been prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible infections, including pseudomonas and MRSA, and her fluid status is being closely monitored. The patient's malignancy and ongoing treatment plan are also discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever and hypotension, there is a risk of sepsis, especially considering her neutropenic state.
2. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient is currently classified as sepsis without organ dysfunction, her condition needs close monitoring for any signs of organ failure.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating potential hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has received R-ICE chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The patient's fever and hypotension indicate the possibility of sepsis without organ dysfunction. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover pseudomonas and MRSA. Her platelet count is low, and she has been given platelets with Tylenol and Benadryl. The patient's hemoglobin level is also low, and she will receive one unit of packed red blood cells. Her white blood cell count is decreased, and she will be monitored closely. The patient is on a neutropenic diet and aggressive electrolyte repletion. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia has been initiated. The patient's family has been contacted, and her code status has been discussed. Disposition is pending stabilization.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis progression to septic shock
2. Organ dysfunction due to sepsis
3. Infection from pseudomonas or MRSA
4. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
5. Anemia due to low hemoglobin levels
6. Infection-related complications such as c"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has been treated with R-ICE chemotherapy regimen, which consists of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The patient's fever and neutropenia are likely due to the chemotherapy. Blood cultures have grown Gram-negative rods (GNR), indicating a bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover for possible pseudomonas and MRSA infections. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 78/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs and decreased lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 18 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes. An imaging study shows a possible hematoma at the site of attempted internal jugular vein catheterization and increased basilar lung markings. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further interventions include obtaining a repeat chest X-ray, checking an echocardiogram, and considering a transfer to the floor if she continues to stabilize."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who is currently in the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has received treatment with R-ICE chemotherapy, which likely caused her neutropenia. The source of infection is unclear, but she has been experiencing fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Her vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure of 78/35 mmHg, heart rate of 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for pseudomonas and MRSA. Her lab results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated troponin levels. Imaging shows increased basilar lung markings but no pneumothorax. Microbiology results indicate the presence of GNR in blood cultures. The patient's assessment and plan include treating febrile neutropenia with cefepime and vancomycin, addressing hypotension, and monitoring for pulmonary edema. Other medical concerns include mantle cell lymphoma, which she is being treated for with allopurinol. Her oncology recommendations include starting Neupogen 300 today. She is also on a neutropenic diet and aggressive electrolyte repletion. Prophylactic measures include boots (no PPI),"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who is currently in the ICU. She presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. The patient underwent R-ICE chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Febrile neutropenia: This condition is characterized by a high fever and a low white blood cell count, which increases the risk of infection. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infections.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and urine output is necessary. Inotropic support may be required if the hypotension does not respond to initial management.

3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory support and oxygenation status should be closely monitored due to the risk of developing pulmonary edema, especially given the presence of mild mitral regurgitation and small pericardial effusion as seen on the echocardiogram.

4. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: The patient has a red, warm, and 4 cm enduration with a 1-2 cm lesion in the center. This could indicate a potential source of GI bleeding. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who presented to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has undergone chemotherapy with R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) and is likely neutropenic from the treatment. Blood cultures are positive for GNR (Gram-negative rod), indicating a potential bacterial infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F (39.3°C), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 98/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 18, and normal kidney function. An echocardiogram reveals regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild mitral regurgitation, and a small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. Imaging studies also show new wall motion abnormalities and a slightly larger pericardial effusion compared to a previous study. The patient is currently being treated with meropenem for pseudomonas coverage, vancomycin for MRSA coverage, and flagyl for possible gut translocation. She is also receiving supportive care including Neup"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She underwent a chemotherapy regimen called R-ICE (rituxan, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide). Her current condition includes neutropenic fever, cellulitis of the left labia with a central lesion, hypotension, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation requiring oxygen supplementation.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA. Blood cultures have grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to meropenem, so the antibiotic regimen has been adjusted accordingly. Other medications include vancomycin, acyclovir, and Neupogen (filgrastim) to stimulate white blood cell production.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 98/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen. Her laboratory results indicate leukopenia (white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL), anemia (hemoglobin of 9.0 g"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypotension.
- She has undergone R-ICE chemotherapy (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide).
- The patient is neutropenic from chemotherapy, and possible sources of infection include gut translocation or labial cellulitis/abscess.
- Blood cultures have grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is pan-sensitive.
- The patient is currently being treated with meropenem and vancomycin.
- She has a low white blood cell count (0.1 K/uL) and platelet count (18).
- Her chest X-ray shows mild mitral regurgitation, small pericardial effusion without tamponade, and wall motion abnormalities.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows:
   - Temperature: 39.3°C (102.7°F)
   - Heart rate: 100 bpm (Sinus Rhythm)
   - Blood pressure: 98/71 mmHg (77/46-144/113)
   - Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
   - Oxygen saturation: 98% on nasal cannula
- The patient's labs show elevated lactic acid levels, low potassium, and normal magnesium and phosphate levels.
- She is receiving Neupogen 300 SC daily and Tylenol for pain and fever.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring for potential complications such as sepsis, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever and hypotension suggest a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Pulmonary edema: Given the patient's hypotension and recent fluid administration, there is a risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VTACH and recent myocardial infarction increase the risk of recurrent arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count puts her at risk for bleeding, particularly if invasive procedures are required.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney injury, which can be exacerbated by hypotension and potential sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Neutropenic patients are at increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if they have a history of gastrointestinal lesions or ulcers.
7. Abscess formation: The patient's labial cellulitis/abscess could progress to a more serious infection, potentially requiring surgical intervention.
8. Thrombotic events: The patient's history of mantle cell lymphoma and recent chemotherapy increase the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has been treated with R-ICE chemotherapy, which consists of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The patient's blood cultures have grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential infections, including MRSA. She has developed cellulitis of the labia with a central lesion and is also being treated for this. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's neutropenic state and the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in her blood cultures, there is a high risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt management of any signs of infection is crucial.
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension requires continuous monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation as needed. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of shock or poor perfusion.
3. Pulmonary Edema: Limiting fluid administration and using diuretics like Lasix may be necessary to prevent pulmonary edema.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia (VTACH): The patient had an episode of VTACH previously, and further evaluation is needed to determine the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has received R-ICE chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.7°F, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 98/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's lab results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 18, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but her lactic acid level is elevated at 1.5 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging shows regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild mitral regurgitation, and a small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. The echocardiogram also reveals new wall motion abnormalities compared to a prior study. Microbiology tests indicate negative results for Clostridium difficile toxin and urine culture, but a preliminary blood culture growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

   Her platelets came back at 13 and she was given a unit of platelets.
   She had a trans-labial U/S which showed no fluid collection so OB/GYN
   deferred management.
   ID was consulted & they recommended meropenum and vanco.
   Labial cellulitis was examened last night showing worsening of
   infection (spread beyond marked borders) and some peri-rectal skin
   breakdown.
   Cards made recommendations re: long term management -- metoprolol,
   lisinopril and ASA when condition improves.  patient was started on

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's platelet count is low, and she has received a unit of platelets. A trans-labial ultrasound showed no fluid collection, so the OB/GYN deferred management. The ID consultant recommended meropenem and vancomycin. The patient's condition worsened, with worsening cellulitis and peri-rectal skin breakdown. The patient reports feeling well and has small amounts of diarrhea. She denies having fevers, chills, N/V/CP/SOB. Her allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.4°C (101.2°F), blood pressure 94/68 mmHg, heart rate 108 bpm, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal cardiac markers. The patient's imaging studies reveal decreased pulmonary edema and a new finding of regional LV systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram. Blood cultures have grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is pan-sensitive.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has been treated with R-ICE chemotherapy (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) and is likely neutropenic due to chemotherapy. The source of infection could be the gut translocation, as blood cultures are growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa or possibly newly recognized labial cellulitis/abscess. 

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Her laboratory results indicate leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging shows no evidence of fluid collection, but there is moderate subcutaneous edema in the left labial region.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Febrile neutropenia: Continue meropenem and vancomycin. Treat broadly to cover Pseudomonas and MRSA.
2. Labial abscess/cellulitis: Evaluate for fluid collection with ultrasound, consult OB/GYN for drainage if positive. Mark border and watch for spread. Continue vancomycin and meropenem.
3. Hypotension: Tolerate lower blood pressures as long as the patient looks well, perfusing tissues well, and follow urine output.
4. Pulmonary edema: Limit fluid"

   She looks and feels better but her labial erythema continues to spread

   BMT when we can expect her counts to return. BP is low, but stable but
   her HR has stayed in 120's. CXR markedly better - not clear what her
   volume status is now - thirsty but not extremely so.  I do wonder if

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is fever. The patient feels better but is still febrile. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including Acyclovir, Cefipime, Vancomycin, and Meropenem.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/61 mmHg to 116/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is fluctuating between 38.4°C and 37.3°C.

The patient has a history of neutropenia, fever, lymphoma, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and possible hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock. There is also mention of cellulitis with spreading labial erythema.

The patient's lab results show low white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range. Troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. Other lab values such as potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), phosphate (PO4), calcium (Ca), and blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination."

   # Febrile neutropenia:  s/p R-ICE rituxan, ifosfamide, carboplatin and
   etoposide.  Likely neutropenic from chemo.  ID source possibly gut
   translocation as blood cultures growing P. aeruginosa or possibly newly
   recognized labial cellulitis/abscess.   Will have to treat broadly to
   cover pseudomonas and MRSA given presentation with severe hypotension.
   - Blood culture: Pseudomonas aeruginosa pan sensitive
   - continue meropenem 1g q8h IV
   - continue vanco 1gm IV q12
   - C. diff toxin [**2118-7-11**]: negative

   - tylenol prn pain of fever
   .
   # L Labial Abscess/cellulitis:
   - U/S to evaluate for fluid collection.  If positive fluid collection
   consult OB/GYN for drainage.
   - mark border and watch for spread
   - continue vancomycin and meropenem
   .
   # Hypotension: tolerate lower BPs as long as the patient is looking
   well, perfusing tissues well, follow urine output.
   .
   # pulmonary edema: limit fluid boluses today.  Continue to monitor
   UOP.  Pt responded well to lasix 10mg IV last night.  Repeat dose today
   to maintain UOP. [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes; Use NC at 2 L as needed to maintain

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has been treated with R-ICE chemotherapy, which consists of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The patient's neutropenia is likely due to the chemotherapy, and the source of infection is possibly a gut translocation or newly recognized labial cellulitis/abscess.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 87/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem and vancomycin.

Her lab results indicate severe neutropenia with a white blood cell count of 0.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 42. The patient has negative C. difficile toxin and blood cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is pan-sensitive.

The patient is being closely monitored for potential complications such as pulmonary edema, cardiac ischemia/ventricular tachycardia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She is also receiving treatment for anxiety and proph"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo woman w hx of mantle cell lymphoma s/p ICE on [**6-29**] here with
   febrile neutropenia and hypotension.
   # Febrile neutropenia:  s/p R-ICE rituxan, ifosfamide, carboplatin and
   etoposide.  Likely neutropenic from chemo.  ID source possibly gut
   translocation as blood cultures growing P. aeruginosa or possibly
   labial cellulitis/abscess.   Will have to treat broadly to cover
   pseudomonas and MRSA given presentation with severe hypotension.
   - Blood culture: Pseudomonas aeruginosa pan sensitive
   - continue meropenem 1g q8h IV
   - continue vanco 1gm IV q12
   - C. diff toxin [**2118-7-11**]: negative
   - had received neulasta last week; continue Neupogen 300 SC daily if
   WBC < 1000 per BMT recs
   - tylenol prn pain of fever
   .
   # L Labial Abscess/cellulitis:
   -  very mild improvement (erythema on borders resolving)
   - U/S ([**2118-7-11**]) no fluid collection. Without fluid collection there
s no
   indication to I &D lesion.
   - Gyn/Onc: did not feel she had signs of fasciitis, no procedures
   waranteed at this time, continue Abx
   - mark border and watch for spread
   - continue vancomycin and meropenem
   .
   # Hypotension: tolerate lower BPs as long as the patient is looking
   well, perfusing tissues well, follow urine output. Continue to hold
   antihypertensive medications.
   .
   # pulmonary edema: much improved; limit fluid boluses today.  Continue
   to monitor UOP.  Pt responds well to lasix 10mg IV restart if pulmonary
   symptoms return.  Use NC at 2 L as needed to maintain SpO2 > 93%
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia/VTACH: Pt likely that patient had MI between [**3-12**] and
   now unclear if r/t to ACS vs demand ischemia/infarct.  Believe VT is
   likely secondary to AMI or more likely toxic metabolic factors. Can
   start Atorvastatin 40-80mg now.  Recommend starting low dose ACEI and
   Carvedilol when BP permits.  Start asa when plt counts >[**Numeric Identifier **].
   Consider low dose diuretic (spironolactone). Carefully monitor
   potassium as inpatient.  Set up outpatient cardiac follow up. Consider
   scheduling myocardial stress perfusion imaging as an impatient.
   -Patient has been tachy in the setting of recent ischemia.  Continue
   metoprolol 12.5mg po TID.
   .
   # Mantle cell lymphoma: s/p ICE (as above).  Will continue allopurinol
   for now.  Monitor counts as follows:
   - platelets: increased to 42.  Give 1 bag platelet with tylenol and
   benadryl if falls below 30
   - hct: goal is >25.  currently 24. transfuse 1 unit pRBC.
   - WBC: low as above
   - apprec onc recs: cont neupogen 300 if WBC < 1000
   - acyclovir for hx zoster
   -CMV viral load ordered to further evaluated diarrhea.

   # FEN: neutropenic diet.  Aggressive lytes repletion
   # Anxiety
 start home dose of lorazepam.
   # Proph: boots (no PPI).  monitor sugars; hold on HISS for now.
   -Holding bowel regimen d/t increased stools.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo woman w hx of mantle cell lymphoma s/p ICE on [**6-29**] here with
   febrile neutropenia and hypotension.
   # Febrile neutropenia:  s/p R-ICE rituxan, ifosfamide, carboplatin and
   etoposide.  Likely neutropenic from chemo.  ID source possibly gut
   translocation as blood cultures growing P. aeruginosa or possibly
   labial cellulitis/abscess.   Will have to treat broadly to cover
   pseudomonas and MRSA given presentation with severe hypotension.
   - Blood culture: Pseudomonas aeruginosa pan sensitive
   - continue meropenem 1g q8h IV
   - continue vanco 1gm IV q12
   - C. diff toxin [**2118-7-11**]: negative
   - had received neulasta last week; continue Neupogen 300 SC daily if
   WBC < 1000 per BMT recs
   - tylenol prn pain of fever
   .
   # L Labial Abscess/cellulitis:
   -  very mild improvement (erythema on borders resolving)
   - U/S ([**2118-7-11**]) no fluid collection. Without fluid collection there
s no
   indication to I &D lesion.
   - Gyn/Onc: did not feel she had signs of fasciitis, no procedures
   warranted at this time, continue Abx
   - mark border and watch for spread
   - continue vancomycin and meropenem
   .
   # Hypotension: tolerate lower BPs as long as the patient is looking
   well, perfusing tissues well, follow urine output.
   # pulmonary edema: much improved; limit fluid boluses.  Continue to
   monitor UOP.  Pt responds well to lasix 10mg IV restart if pulmonary
   symptoms return.  Use NC at 2 L as needed to maintain SpO2 > 93%
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia/VTACH: Pt likely that patient had MI between [**3-12**] and
   now unclear if r/t to ACS vs demand ischemia/infarct.  Believe VT is
   likely secondary to AMI or more likely toxic metabolic factors. Can
   start Atorvastatin 40-80mg now.  Recommend starting low dose ACEI and
   Carvedilol when BP permits.  Start asa when plt counts >[**Numeric Identifier **].
   Consider low dose diuretic (spironolactone). Carefully monitor
   potassium as inpatient.  Set up outpatient cardiac follow up. Consider
   scheduling myocardial stress perfusion imaging as an impatient.
   -Patient has been tachy in the setting of recent ischemia.  Continue
   metoprolol 12.5mg po TID.
   .
   # Mantle cell lymphoma: s/p ICE (as above).  Will continue allopurinol
   for now.  Monitor counts as follows:
   - platelets: increased to 42.  Give 1 bag platelet with tylenol and
   benadryl if falls below 30
   - hct: goal is >25.  currently 24. transfuse 1 unit pRBC.
   - WBC: low as above
   - apprec onc recs: cont neupogen 300 if WBC < 1000
   - acyclovir for hx zoster
   -CMV viral load ordered to further evaluated diarrhea.
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet.  Aggressive lytes repletion
   # Anxiety
 start home dose of lorazepam.
   # Proph: boots (no PPI).  monitor sugars; hold on HISS for now.
   -Holding bowel regimen d/t increased stools.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who presented to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She had received R-ICE chemotherapy, which likely caused the neutropenia. The source of infection is still unclear, but blood cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa suggest a possible gut translocation or labial cellulitis/abscess. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), blood pressure of 87/51 mmHg (58/82 mmHg), heart rate of 107 bpm (100-128 bpm), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (18-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 0.2 K/uL, low platelet count (Plt) of 23 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.5 mmol/L. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but she has mild hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L. Other lab results show elevated glucose levels and slightly elevated troponin-T levels.

The patient's labial cellulitis appears to be improving, and there is no indication for surgical intervention at this time. She will continue to receive antibiotics to cover for"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has been treated with R-ICE chemotherapy, which consists of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The patient's neutropenia is likely due to the chemotherapy, and there is a possible source of infection in the gut translocation, as indicated by blood cultures growing P. aeruginosa.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 87/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including neutropenia, fever (hypothermia), lymphoma (cancer, malignant neoplasm, lymphoid), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and hypovolemic shock. 

The patient's lab results show low white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin concentration (Hct), and low platelet count (Plt). Her blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to meropenem. She is currently receiving meropenem and vancomycin intravenously. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with neutropenic fever, bacteremia, and labial cellulitis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple antibiotics. His vital signs show a low-grade fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and an oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's blood work indicates severe neutropenia with a WBC count of 0.2 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 29 K/uL, and an elevated troponin-T level of 0.10. The patient has a history of lymphoma and is currently receiving treatment in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is also receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's neutropenic fever and bacteremia indicate an ongoing infection. There is a risk of further complications such as septic shock, organ dysfunction, or progression to severe sepsis/septic shock.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis for DVT. Close monitoring of any signs of bleeding or bruising is essential.
3. Cardiac issues: Elevated troponin-T levels suggest cardiac involvement, potentially indicating myocardial injury or ischemia. Monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and hypotension. She has a low white blood cell count (0.2 K/uL) and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA. The source of infection is possibly a gut translocation or newly recognized labial cellulitis/abscess. She has been treated with R-ICE chemotherapy and her platelet count is increasing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's low white blood cell count and hypotension suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to treat the suspected infection.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's hypotension and low blood pressure indicate possible organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is important.
3. Shock: The patient's hypotension and low blood pressure suggest the possibility of shock, specifically hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss. Fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of urine output are necessary.
4. Pulmonary edema: Limiting fluid boluses and monitoring for signs of pulmonary edema are essential due to the patient's response to Lasix and the need to maintain urine output.
5. Cardiac ischemia/VTACH: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and"

   Remains febrile but trending down.  WBC starting to increase slowly.
   Cellulitis seems to be starting to respond.  Still unclear whether
   cellulitis is due to Pseudomonas or to another organism but nothing to
   aspirate or drain yet. Needs continued close observation as she may
   develop [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3550**] as counts improve.  HR has come down slightly.  We
   are still holding ASA while plt ct down.  Should have stress this
