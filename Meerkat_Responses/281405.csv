   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo F with PMH of alzheimer's type dementia, recent hospitalizations
   for PNA and UTI who was admitted following episode of hypoxia and
   cyanosis.
   .
   #Hypoxic respiratory failure - unclear etiology, possible causes
   include flash pulmonary edema given evidence of vascular congestion on
   CXR.  Possible preciptants of pulmonary edema could be hypertension,
   acute myocardial ischemia/infarction, anxiety/agitation.  COPD
   exacerbation also possible and was initial diagnosis in ED, initially
   seemed to respond to nebs in the ED however following developed
   recurrant respiratory distress and was intubated.  Pneumonia is another
   possible cause given question of lower lobe infiltrate on CXR and thick
   secretions suctioned from trach as well as bandemia.  Pulmonary
   embolism is also on the differential however less likely explanation
   than above mentioned causes.  She was intubated in the ED due to
   concern for increased work of breathing and tachypnea/hypoxia.
   -continue to treat for PNA with vancomycin and zosyn (given two recent
   hospitalizaiton, current rehab resident and recent course of
   ciprofloxacin)
   -follow up blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -continue with mechanical ventillation overnight
   -RSBI/SBT in AM
   -check ABG
   -continue with albuterol/atrovent MDI
   -hold off on additional steroids for now as no significant wheezing on
   exam
   .
   #Bandemia - concerning for acute infection, with most likely cause at
   this time either UTI given dirty UA or pneumonia given possible
   infiltrate, hypoxia and thick secretions being suctioned from ET tube.
   On review of recent micro data it appears that her recent morganella
   uti was resistant to ciprofloxacin with which she was treated, which is
   concerning that she could have an untreated UTI as cause of her
   bandemia.
   -continue with vancomycin and zosyn to cover for possible PNA
   -morganella species from recent UTI with intermediate sensitivity to
   zosyn, good sensitivity to ceftriaxone; will consider changing to
   cefepime which would cover pseudomonas and her UTI in AM
   -f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   -send C.diff if diarrhea
   .
   #Hypotension - on arrival to ICU blood pressure decreased to SBP 80's -
   90's, however she continued to have good urine output with about
   50-60cc's/hour after getting total of 4L IVF since admission.
   -continue to monitor BP
   -hold off on additional IVF for now given concern for element of
   pulmonary edema
   -monitor urine output (if drops to less than 0.5 cc/kg/hr will consider
   additional IVF vs possibility of SIRS/Sepsis)
   .
   #Dementia/Delirium - she has had progressive decline since her recent
   hospitalization in [**6-13**] with likely superimposed delirium [**3-9**] acute
   medical illness.
   -will hold on her namenda for now
   -reorientation as possible
   .
   #h/o Hypertension - hypotensive on admission with good urine output
   -hold metoprolol
   .
   #Hypernatremia - most likely hypovolemic hypernatremia likely with
   component of free water defecit as well
   -repeat Na after IVF given in ED
   -replete free water with D5 (will hold off on NGT fluids pending
   RSBI/SBT in AM)
   .
   #Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - in NSR on admission
   -holding metoprolol given concern for possible SIRS/Sepsis and
   borderline hypotension
   -continue aspirin (not on coumadin)
   .
   #Tremor - evaluated by neurology during her recent admission, felt most
   likely essential tremor.  No seizure activity on EEG.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's type dementia, recent hospitalizations for pneumonia and urinary tract infection, and admitted after experiencing hypoxia and cyanosis. She was initially diagnosed with COPD exacerbation in the emergency department but developed recurrent respiratory distress and was subsequently intubated. Possible causes for her hypoxic respiratory failure include flash pulmonary edema, COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. 

The patient is being treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and Zosyn. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and follow-up cultures are planned. Mechanical ventilation will continue overnight, and a respiratory system bedside examination will be performed in the morning. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis will also be conducted. 

The patient is showing signs of bandemia, which is concerning for an acute infection, potentially a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia. She has been receiving vancomycin and Zosyn to cover for possible pneumonia, and consideration is being given to changing antibiotics in the morning to cover Morganella species, which were resistant to ciprofloxacin but sensitive to ceftriaxone. 

The patient's blood pressure has decreased to the 80s-90s, but she has maintained good urine output. IV fluid administration will be monitored, and additional IV fluids may be considered if necessary. 

The patient's mental status has progressively declined since her recent hospital"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure due to pneumonia (PNA). She has a history of recent hospitalizations for pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has copious purulent secretions, significant bandemia, and a bacterial etiology is suspected. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), while awaiting culture data. 

The patient also has a history of UTI with Morganella morganii cultured from urine during her most recent admission. Despite reported resistance to ciprofloxacin, high levels were likely achieved in the urine, and the degree of pyuria is now diminished. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics for PNA.

Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient's blood pressure decreased to the 80s-90s systolic, and she has continued to have adequate urine output. Bolus fluids are being given as needed to maintain urine output >30-40 cc/hr, avoiding additional maintenance fluids which would worsen positive volume balance prior to extubation.

The patient has shown a progressive decline since her recent hospitalization, likely superimposed delirium due to acute medical illness. Reorientation is being done PRN, and sedation is maintained with bolus doses to keep the patient comfortable on the ventil"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's type dementia and recent hospitalizations for pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of PNA. 

The patient's current condition includes significant bandemia, indicating a bacterial etiology, and copious purulent secretions. The patient is being supported with ventilatory support, sedation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting culture data. The patient also has a history of UTI, with Morganella cultured from urine during the most recent admission, despite reported resistance to ciprofloxacin. 

The patient's blood pressure is being monitored closely due to hypotension on arrival to the ICU and concern for element of pulmonary edema. Additional IV fluids are being held off for now. The patient's urine output is also being monitored, and if it drops to less than 0.5 cc/kg/hr, additional IV fluids will be considered versus the possibility of SIRS/Sepsis.

The patient has a progressive decline since her recent hospitalization with likely superimposed delirium on acute medical illness. Namenda has been held for now, and reorientation is being provided as possible.

The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with correction of free water deficit. Repeat Na will be done after IVF given in the emergency department. Free water will be repleted with D"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo F with PMH of alzheimer's type dementia, recent hospitalizations
   for PNA and UTI who was admitted following episode of hypoxia and
   cyanosis.
   .
   #Hypoxic respiratory failure - unclear etiology, possible causes
   include flash pulmonary edema given evidence of vascular congestion on
   CXR.  Possible preciptants of pulmonary edema could be hypertension,
   acute myocardial ischemia/infarction, anxiety/agitation.  COPD
   exacerbation also possible and was initial diagnosis in ED, initially
   seemed to respond to nebs in the ED however following developed
   recurrant respiratory distress and was intubated.  Pneumonia is another
   possible cause given question of lower lobe infiltrate on CXR and thick
   secretions suctioned from trach as well as bandemia.  Pulmonary
   embolism is also on the differential however less likely explanation
   than above mentioned causes.  She was intubated in the ED due to
   concern for increased work of breathing and tachypnea/hypoxia.
   -continue to treat for PNA with vancomycin and zosyn (given two recent
   hospitalizaiton, current rehab resident and recent course of
   ciprofloxacin)
   -follow up blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -continue with mechanical ventillation overnight
   -RSBI/SBT in AM
   -check ABG
   -continue with albuterol/atrovent MDI
   -hold off on additional steroids for now as no significant wheezing on
   exam
   .
   #Bandemia - concerning for acute infection, with most likely cause at
   this time either UTI given dirty UA or pneumonia given possible
   infiltrate, hypoxia and thick secretions being suctioned from ET tube.
   On review of recent micro data it appears that her recent morganella
   uti was resistant to ciprofloxacin with which she was treated, which is
   concerning that she could have an untreated UTI as cause of her
   bandemia.
   -continue with vancomycin and zosyn to cover for possible PNA
   -morganella species from recent UTI with intermediate sensitivity to
   zosyn, good sensitivity to ceftriaxone; will consider changing to
   cefepime which would cover pseudomonas and her UTI in AM
   -f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   -send C.diff if diarrhea
   .
   #Hypotension - on arrival to ICU blood pressure decreased to SBP 80's -
   90's, however she continued to have good urine output with about
   50-60cc's/hour after getting total of 4L IVF since admission.
   -continue to monitor BP
   -hold off on additional IVF for now given concern for element of
   pulmonary edema
   -monitor urine output (if drops to less than 0.5 cc/kg/hr will consider
   additional IVF vs possibility of SIRS/Sepsis)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia (PNA), urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation (Afib), hypertension (HTN), and tremor. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/51 mmHg to 137/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV ventilation, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 424 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 230 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a differential of 9.6 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.1%, normal platelet count (Plt) of 187 K/uL, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of recent hospitalizations for pneumonia and urinary tract infection. She has copious purulent secretions and significant bandemia, indicating a bacterial etiology. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, including vancomycin and Zosyn, while awaiting culture data. Blood and sputum cultures are pending.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure decreased to the 80s-90s upon arrival to the ICU. She continues to have adequate urine output and is receiving a 5L bolus PRN to maintain urine output > 30-40 cc/hr. Additional maintenance fluids are avoided to prevent worsening positive volume balance before extubation.
2. Acute Delirium: The patient has experienced a progressive decline since her recent hospitalization, likely due to superimposed delirium on acute medical illness. Reorientation is performed PRN, and bolus sedation is used to maintain comfort while on mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypertension: The patient is currently holding metoprolol due to hypotension.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with the correction of her free water deficit.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease, intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia (PNA). She has a history of recent hospitalizations for PNA and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected healthcare-associated PNA, awaiting culture data. She also has a UTI caused by Morganella, which is being treated with the same antibiotics. The patient's blood pressure is unstable, requiring close monitoring and fluid boluses to maintain urine output. She has a progressive decline in mental status, likely due to superimposed delirium on acute medical illness. Other medical issues include hypertension, hypernatremia, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and essential tremor. The patient is receiving nutritional support through a feeding tube and is being monitored for glycemic control, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and susceptibility to infections, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Delirium: The patient's mental status is declining, indicating a potential superimposed delirium on acute medical illness. Delirium can lead to complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, and worsening cognitive impairment.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, requiring"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to pneumonia. She has a history of recent hospitalizations for pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Upon admission, she was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and bandemia, indicating a possible bacterial infection. She has copious purulent secretions, suggesting a bacterial etiology. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and is also being treated for a urinary tract infection caused by Morganella. She is also on medication for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and essential tremor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's current condition indicates HAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure and potential sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although the patient is being treated for a UTI caused by Morganella, there is a risk of antibiotic resistance and recurrence if appropriate measures are not taken.
3. Delirium: The patient's cognitive decline and superimposed delirium can complicate her recovery and increase the risk of adverse events such as falls or pressure ulcers.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to ensure adequate organ perfusion and prevent further complications.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib), hypertension (HTN), and tremor. 

24-hour events include the administration of lopressor to control blood pressure, holding tube feeding (TF) anticipating a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and starting Lasix IV to manage fluid overload. The patient is receiving multiple medications including lopressor, heparin, midazolam, furosemide, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and lansoprazole.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/48 to 132/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood glucose level is 114 mg/dL, white blood cell count is within normal range, and platelet count is stable.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated lactate level of 2.0 mmol/L and slightly low albumin level of 3.1 g/dL. Urine culture shows E. coli > 100,000 org/ml, and sputum gram"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 126/48 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and essential tremor. She is receiving multiple medications including lopressor, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), lasix, heparin sodium, midazolam (Versed), furosemide (Lasix), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and albuterol MDI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory system infection (RSI) monitoring should be implemented to prevent VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin has been initiated to reduce the risk of DVT.
3. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of nosocomial infections. Frequent monitoring of vital signs, daily care bundles, and appropriate use of antibiotics are important in preventing nosocomial infections.
4. Medication side effects: Some medications like lopressor and lasix have potential side effects that need to be monitored closely. Regular assessment of blood pressure and electrolyte levels is necessary.
5. Cognitive decline: The patient's Alzheimer's disease may worsen during the ICU stay. Regular assessment of mental status and cognitive function is important.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is advised."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI). She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/48 to 77/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and tremor. She has been treated with lopressor for hypertension and lasix for fluid overload. Her recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Microbiology tests indicate the presence of E. coli in the urine and GPC in sputum. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, midazolam, furosemide, and lansoprazole. The plan is to continue with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator and monitor the response to low-dose lasix for fluid management. Further plans include holding tube feeding for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), providing sedation as needed with midazolam, and considering initiation of anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/43-126/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient has been diuresed with furosemide (Lasix) and has produced 4 liters of urine over the last 24 hours. Fluid balance is negative by 1.4 liters. The patient's labs show normal WBC count, Hct, Plt, TropT, Glucose, and electrolyte levels. Microbiology results indicate GPC in pairs in the sputum and E. Coli in the urine, which is sensitive to Zosyn.

Potential Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is at risk for worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing infection.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient may develop further complications related to the UTI, such as kidney damage or sepsis.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is still positive, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a history of pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume (Vt) of 282 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 7 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 87. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate (HR) of 85 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 100/43 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation. Her condition has improved, but she remains intubated.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a history of pneumonia, which may have contributed to her initial respiratory failure.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient also has a UTI caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to the antibiotics she is receiving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's condition has shown improvement, as she is now afebrile with normal white blood cell count, diminished secretions, and less purulent sputum. The patient is comfortable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is expected to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) later today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxic respiratory failure, which could potentially recur if there is worsening of her respiratory status or if she does not tolerate the SBT.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with PNA caused by E. coli. If left untreated or inadequately treated, the infection may progress and lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a confirmed UTI caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to the current antibiotic therapy (zosyn). If the antibiotic therapy is not effective or if the infection spreads, it may lead to systemic complications.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and is currently on rate control medication (lopressor). It is important to monitor her cardiac rhythm and ensure appropriate management to prevent arrhythmia-related complications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a history of pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli. The patient has shown clinical improvement, including reduced secretions, diminished purulence, and normal white blood cell count. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 87, indicating the possibility of extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/43 mmHg to 126/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is also receiving diuretics for fluid balance management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a history of PNA, which can lead to respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxic respiratory failure or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an active UTI caused by E. coli, which may progress to a more severe infection if not appropriately managed.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's initial presentation included volume overload, and close monitoring of fluid balance is essential to prevent complications like pulmonary edema.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient had atrial"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease, presenting with pulmonary aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection. She was previously intubated but has been extubated and is doing well off the ventilator. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 127/92 mmHg to 145/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Her physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, and no murmurs, murmurs, or gallops. She also has a positive bowel sound, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm and dry extremities with 2+ radial pulses bilaterally. 

Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her blood glucose level is within normal range, and electrolytes including sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium are also within normal limits. 

The patient's imaging shows a new blunting of the right CP angle on chest X-ray, likely representing atelectasis or infiltrate. This finding is not consistent with fluid. 

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for pneumonia, along with azithromycin for atypical coverage. Al"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo F with Alzheimer
s, PAF a/w hypoxic respiratory failure in the
   setting of PNA, and UTI.
   #Hypoxic respiratory failure - [**3-9**] PNA, Clinically improved, afebrile
   with nl WBC, has diminished secretions that are less purulent; sputum
   GS 2+ GPC in pairs; cough reflex with stimulation; diuresis should
   improve hemodynamics peri-extubation
   -comfortable on PSV; try on [**6-10**] f/b weaning trial and extubation today
   -cont. vanco/zosyn (day [**6-19**]), azithro (day [**4-10**]) for atypicals
   -albuterol MDI PRN
   # UTI
 Cx + E. Coli; sensitive to zosyn (completing a 14 day course
   for PNA)
   #Afib
 likely converted in the setting of PNA and volume overload,
   spontaneously reverted to SR
   -cont. lopressor 25 mg PO TID for rate control, may uptitrate as needed
   to achieve adeq. rate control
   -would be in favor of initiating anticoagulation with lovenox bridge to
   coumadin; currently on ASA only
   #HTN
 has been hypo- to normotensive
   -restarted lopressor, may uptitrate as BP allows (was on 100 mg PO BID
   as outpt)
   #Tremor - evaluated by neurology during a recent admission, felt most
   likely essential tremor.  No seizure activity on EEG.
   #F/E/N - +2.7 L for [**Location 3549**] goal: -1 to 1.5 L x 24 hrs; patient has had good response to
   low-dose lasix; give another 10 mg IV x 1 this AM
   -monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI). She was extubated yesterday and has been doing well clinically off the ventilator. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/92 mmHg to 145/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her weight is 42.1 kg, and she stands at 63 inches tall. 

Her fluid balance shows an intake of 901 mL, including 300 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 2,806 mL, including 184 mL of urine. She is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula and has been on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, blood glucose level between 81 and 132 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.6-0.8 mg/dL, sodium level of 135-145 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.9-4.8 mEq/L, and magnesium level of 1.7-2.1 mg/dL. 

Imaging reveals a chest X-ray showing new blunting of the right CP angle, likely atelectasis. Microbiology results are negative for sputum culture twice and urine Legionella test. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following: 

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure - improvement observed, afebrile with normal white blood cell count, diminished secretions, and sputum gram stain showing 2+ GPC in pairs. She is comfortable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will be weaned off the ventilator today. 

2. UTI - Escherichia coli detected in urine culture, sensitive to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). 

3. Atrial fibrillation - likely converted in the setting of PNA and volume overload, spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm. 

4. Hypertension - currently normotensive after being previously hypertensive. 

5. Tremor - evaluated by neurology during a recent admission, likely essential tremor. 

6. Fluid and electrolyte management - goal is to maintain fluid balance within normal limits, especially with ongoing diuresis post-extubation. 

7. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer. 

8. Code status - full code."
