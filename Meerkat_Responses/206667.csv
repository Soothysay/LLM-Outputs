   75 yo man with widely metastatic papillary thyroid cancer. S/p XRT.
 HYPOXEMIA, respiratory distress. Much improved following [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   CT demonstrating bilateral nodular and gg opacities. Likely mets to
   lung and mediastinal nodes. Will continue to cover empirically for
   multifocal pneumonia.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE. Exudative. Likely malignant effusion. DDx:
   complicated parapneumonic, unlikely related to small subacute PE.
   Management will be guided by chronicity of reaccumulation, symptoms.
 PE, small, subacute. Will not treat given lack of sxs and bloody
   pleural effusion.
 Widely metastatic disease. New pericardial effusion. Pain not
   currently an issue. Onc to consult. Will request palliative care
   consult as well.
 Aspiration. NPO. Pending esophageal eval with swallow study. Will
   likely need PEG for nutrition.
 HYPERNATREMIA resolved.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old man with metastatic papillary thyroid cancer who presented with respiratory distress. The patient underwent a thoracentesis and showed significant improvement. He has a history of metastatic cancer, previous radiation therapy, and several comorbidities. 

The patient is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia. His vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. The patient has bilateral crackles in his lungs and a small subacute pulmonary embolism. There is also a mention of pleural effusion, which is likely malignant and exudative. 

The patient has widely metastatic disease and a new pericardial effusion. He is not experiencing pain at the moment. Oncology consultation has been requested, as well as a palliative care consult. 

The patient has been placed on NPO status due to suspected aspiration risk and is awaiting an esophageal evaluation with a swallow study. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may be required for nutrition. 

The patient's electrolyte imbalances, such as hypernatremia and hypercalcemia, have been addressed. He is being treated with IV acyclovir for zoster lesions. 

The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old man with widely metastatic papillary thyroid cancer. He presented with respiratory distress, which improved following thoracentesis. The patient has a history of metastatic cancer and has undergone radiation therapy (XRT). He is currently experiencing hypoxemia and respiratory distress, likely due to mets to the lung and mediastinal nodes. The patient also has a pleural effusion, which is exudative and likely malignant. It is important to differentiate between complicated parapneumonic effusion and malignant effusion. The management of the pleural effusion will be guided by the chronicity of reaccumulation and symptoms. The patient also has a small subacute pulmonary embolism (PE), but it will not be treated due to the lack of symptoms and presence of a bloody pleural effusion. The patient has widely metastatic disease and has developed a new pericardial effusion, but pain is not currently an issue. The patient also has hypernatremia and hypercalcemia, which need further evaluation. Additionally, the patient is being treated for zoster with IV acyclovir, as there is no pain associated with it. The patient's nutrition plan is pending esophageal studies. The patient is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

   #. Respiratory distress: patient admitted 4 days ago, with
   leukocytosis, no fevers and x ray that showed multifocal pneumonia. X
   ray this [**4-12**] showed worsening pleural effusion that could definitely
   explain his shortness of breath. He has not spike fevers but his WBC
   continues to trend up despite a/b whic is concerning for underlying
   infection either viral, bacterial. Other posibilites will include PE
   given tachycardia and underlying malignancy. On the other hand, he was
   definitely positive in fluid balance given hydration for hypercalcemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer, who presented with dysphagia and weight loss. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia in the 80s on 6L O2. Thoracentesis was performed, resulting in significant clinical improvement. The patient was started on heparin due to a subsegmental pulmonary embolism seen on CTA. He has been receiving various antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and hypercalcemia. Imaging reveals bilateral patchy opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia, new small bilateral pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion, and large thyroid mass with right paratracheal node and right adrenal mass. The patient has also been diagnosed with hypercalcemia of malignancy and is receiving zolindronic acid. He has been experiencing respiratory distress, and a thoracentesis was performed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 116/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is anxious, tachypneic, and cachectic. Physical examination findings include a fungating lesion on the anterior neck, bilateral crackles"

   Imaging: FINDINGS: The examination was limited secondary to difficulty
   in initiating a
   swallow, which resulted in patient spitting up most boluses. One dry
   swallow
   and one small bolus of thin liquid barium swallow were observed. Bolus
   transport during the oral phase was prolonged and a coating of residue
   remained on the tongue after the swallow. During the pharyngeal phase,
   palatal elevation was normal. Laryngeal elevation, laryngeal valve
   closure,
   and epiglottic deflection were moderately-to-severely impaired.
   Pharyngeal
   contraction was also moderately reduced with residue remaining in the
   valleculae after the teaspoon of thin liquid. While no aspiration was
   observed after the small bolus of thin liquid, residue remained in the
   valleculae until the patient coughed it out through his mouth.
   IMPRESSION: Difficulty initiating swallow. Limited study shows reduced
   laryngeal valve closure and reduced pharyngeal contraction as well as
   residue
   remaining within the valleculae.

s respiratory status worsened after his video swallow yesterday,
   although no aspiration was witnessed. Ddx includes, reaccumulating
   effusion (especially in setting of aggressive hydration for
   hypercalcemia), pulmonary edema from fluid overload, PE (pt known to
   have small subsegmental PE, though was likely old, heparin gtt stopped
   per below), anxiety, infection.  Pt has marked leukocytosis, though no
   fevers or sputum production.  Imaging findings most likely related to
   malignancy although PNA cannot be excluded.  Repeat CXR shows
   reaccumulation of effusion
   -continue supplemental 02 with nebs
   -serial CXR
   -appreciate IP involvement, tentative plan for pleurex catheter
   placement today vs tomorrow, may need pleurodesis in future.  Holding
   lovenox prior to procedure.
   -continue antibiotics for ? PNA, f/u sputum culture
   -check pulsus parodoxus, had small pericardial effusion on CTA, may be
   becoming physiologically significant.
   # Leukocytosis: Pt has been afebrile. No bowel movements, c/o
   constipation so c. diff unlikely.  WBC continues to climb, now >30,
   with left shift.  Ddx includes infection (incl c. diff), malignancy.

   # Hypernatremia: Had been as high as 152, urine osms not c/w DI, likely
   due to NS given on presentation.
   Has normalized with free water repletion.
   -1/2 NS for IVF
   -Continue to monitor.
   # hypercalcemia: Likely due to malignancy, although PTH while on low
   end of normal would be expected to be very low if PTHrP elevated which
   is expected mechanism of malignant hypercalcemia in pt with solid
   tumor.  ? is this related to ectopic vitamin D conversion? Calcium has
   trended down 1 point with pamidronate, IVF and lasix.
   -appreciate endo recs, no role for calcitonin, continue current
   management

   Mg++:2.2 mg/dL, PO4:2.0 mg/dL
   Imaging: FINDINGS: The examination was limited secondary to difficulty
   in initiating a
   swallow, which resulted in patient spitting up most boluses. One dry
   swallow
   and one small bolus of thin liquid barium swallow were observed. Bolus
   transport during the oral phase was prolonged and a coating of residue
   remained on the tongue after the swallow. During the pharyngeal phase,
   palatal elevation was normal. Laryngeal elevation, laryngeal valve
   closure,
   and epiglottic deflection were moderately-to-severely impaired.
   Pharyngeal
   contraction was also moderately reduced with residue remaining in the
   valleculae after the teaspoon of thin liquid. While no aspiration was
   observed after the small bolus of thin liquid, residue remained in the
   valleculae until the patient coughed it out through his mouth.
   IMPRESSION: Difficulty initiating swallow. Limited study shows reduced
   laryngeal valve closure and reduced pharyngeal contraction as well as
   residue
   remaining within the valleculae.

   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 62**] is a 75 yo M w/PMHx sx for metastatic papillary
   thyroid cancer with local invasion and tracheal deviation who presents
   with worsenign o2 requirment and chest x ray showed worsening left
   pleural effusion
   #. Respiratory distress: patient admitted 4 days ago, with
   leukocytosis, no fevers and x ray that showed multifocal pneumonia. X
   ray this [**4-12**] showed worsening pleural effusion that could definitely
   explain his shortness of breath. He has not spike fevers but his WBC
   continues to trend up despite a/b whic is concerning for underlying
   infection either viral, bacterial. Other posibilites will include PE
   given tachycardia and underlying malignancy. On the other hand, he was
   definitely positive in fluid balance given hydration for hypercalcemia.
   - s/p thoracentesis
   -CTA showed findings most c/w metastatic disease, nodular pleura,
   especially on mediastinal aspect.
   -Pleural fluid meets multiple lights

   # Hypernatremia: patient presented with normal sodium on admission.
   Looks normovolemic on exam. He received about 5 L last 24 hours. ddx
   includes DI which might be due to his hypercalcemia, or given high
   cloride and low bicarb it could also be due to NS hydration.  Urine osm
   high, non c/w DI.  Likely due to NS.  Free H20 deficit 2.7L yesterday,
   has corrected partially in 24 ours, Na now 146 down from 150.
   -re-calculate free h20 deficit, give D5W.  Caution with hydration,
   avoid effusion reaccumulation.
   -Continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old man with widely metastatic papillary thyroid cancer, who has undergone radiation therapy (XRT).
- He presented with respiratory distress after a swallow evaluation yesterday, which improved with thoracentesis but worsened since then.
- The patient is experiencing hypoxemia and respiratory distress, likely due to multiple factors including possible malignant pleural effusion, pneumonia, cardiac issues, and recurrent pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has an acute exudative pleural effusion, likely caused by malignant effusion.
- He also has a small subacute pulmonary embolism, but it will not be treated as there are no symptoms and the effusion is bloody.
- The patient has widely metastatic disease, including a new pericardial effusion. There are no current symptoms related to pain, and an oncology consultation has been requested.
- The patient's condition is complicated by hypercalcemia, which is causing increased respiratory distress, and he is receiving IV acyclovir for zoster without pain.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be attributed to various factors, including malignant pleural effusion, pneumonia, cardiac issues, and recurrent pulmonary embolism. It is crucial to address these underlying causes to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old man with widely metastatic papillary thyroid cancer, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has experienced several complications and medical conditions that need to be addressed. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large malignant pleural effusion leading to respiratory distress. There is a possibility of reaccumulation of pleural effusion, which may require further intervention such as chest tube placement or talc pleurodesis.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, which is likely due to the underlying respiratory distress and potential reaccumulation of pleural effusion. Oxygen supplementation may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygen levels.

3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has markedly elevated ionized calcium levels, which can cause increased respiratory distress. Management of hypercalcemia is crucial in this case, considering the patient's inability to tolerate fluids.

4. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a new pericardial effusion, which may require further evaluation and management, especially considering the patient's widely metastatic disease.

5. Zoster: The patient is currently being treated with IV acyclovir for zoster (shingles). However, the lack of pain suggests that this may not be the primary concern at the moment.

6. Malnutrition: The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and"

   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 62**] is a 75 yo M w/PMHx sx for metastatic papillary
   thyroid cancer with local invasion and tracheal deviation who presents
   with worsening o2 requirment and chest x ray showed worsening left
   pleural effusion
   #. Respiratory distress: patient admitted 4 days ago, with
   leukocytosis, no fevers and x ray that showed multifocal pneumonia. X
   ray [**4-12**] showed worsening pleural effusion.  He is s/p 2L thoracentesis
   on [**4-13**], exudative fluid. CTA findings suggestive of metastatic
   involvement of pleura with multiple diffuse opacities in parenchyma.
   Pt
s respiratory status worsened after his video swallow yesterday,
   although no aspiration was witnessed. Ddx includes, reaccumulating
   effusion (especially in setting of aggressive hydration for
   hypercalcemia), pulmonary edema from fluid overload, PE (pt known to
   have small subsegmental PE, though was likely old, heparin gtt stopped
   per below), anxiety, infection.  Pt has marked leukocytosis, though no
   fevers or sputum production.  Imaging findings most likely related to
   malignancy although PNA cannot be excluded.  Repeat CXR shows
   reaccumulation of effusion
   -continue supplemental 02 with nebs
   -serial CXR
   -appreciate IP involvement, tentative plan for pleurex catheter
   placement today vs tomorrow, may need pleurodesis in future.  Holding
   lovenox prior to procedure.
   -continue antibiotics for ? PNA, f/u sputum culture
   -check pulsus parodoxus, had small pericardial effusion on CTA, may be
   becoming physiologically significant.
   # Leukocytosis: Pt has been afebrile. No bowel movements, c/o
   constipation so c. diff unlikely.  WBC continues to climb, now >30,
   with left shift.  Ddx includes infection (incl c. diff), malignancy.
   - pan cx if spikes
   - stool cx r/o c diff although abdomen benign, not stooling.
   -f/u pleural fluid cytology, cultures
   # Hypernatremia: Had been as high as 152, urine osms not c/w DI, likely
   due to NS given on presentation.
   Has normalized with free water repletion.
   -1/2 NS for IVF
   -Continue to monitor.
   # hypercalcemia: Likely due to malignancy, although PTH while on low
   end of normal would be expected to be very low if PTHrP elevated which
   is expected mechanism of malignant hypercalcemia in pt with solid
   tumor.  ? is this related to ectopic vitamin D conversion? Calcium has
   trended down 1 point with pamidronate, IVF and lasix.
   -appreciate endo recs, no role for calcitonin, continue current
   management
   -f/u PTHrP
   -Monitor closely for symptoms
   -Aggressively treat constipation
   # dysphagia: Mass effect due to tumor.  Not aspirating but failed video
   swallow.  Initially wanted tube feeds, eval for PEG.  After attending

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with metastatic papillary thyroid cancer who was admitted with dysphagia, weight loss, and a large pleural effusion.
- The patient has a history of radiation treatment for cancer and is currently experiencing worsening oxygen requirements, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
- The patient's respiratory status worsened after a video swallow, although no aspiration was witnessed. The differential diagnosis includes reaccumulating effusion, pulmonary edema from fluid overload, pulmonary embolism (PE), anxiety, and infection.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift but no fever or sputum production. Imaging findings suggest widespread infection and metastases.
- The patient's sodium levels were high initially but have normalized with free water repletion. The hypernatremia is likely due to normal saline given on presentation.
- The patient has hypercalcemia likely due to malignancy. Calcium levels have trended down with pamidronate, IVF, and lasix.
- The patient has dysphagia due to mass effect from the tumor. The patient initially wanted tube feeds but decided against it after attending discussion.
- The patient has a small pericardial effusion on CTA, which may be becoming physiologically significant.
- The patient's zoster was treated with valgancyclovir, but the recent dysphagia/vomiting make it unlikely that the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer and local invasion. He presents with worsening oxygen requirements and a chest X-ray showing worsening left pleural effusion. 

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low levels of oxygen in the blood.
2. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient has high levels of sodium in his blood.
3. Hypercalcemia (high calcium): The patient has high levels of calcium in his blood.
4. Pleural effusion, acute: The patient has accumulated fluid in the pleural space around his lungs.

The assessment and plan for the patient include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to the reaccumulating pleural effusion. The underlying cause could be pneumonia (PNA) given the infiltrates on the chest X-ray, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), and no fevers or sputum production. No growth from the pleural effusion was found, and it is likely malignant.
