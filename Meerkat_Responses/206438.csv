","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male who was found unresponsive and intubated for airway protection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 501 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 68, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate (HR) of 70 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 104/62 mmHg to 130/106 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%. 

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 310 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 28.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 310, creatinine (Cr) of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.08, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 25, glucose level of 100 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) of 231/81. The patient's electrolytes include sodium (Na+) of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.2 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 7.6 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) of 3.9 mg/dL. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hypoglycemia, possible pneumonia, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), urinary tract infection (UTI) with a sensitive Enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). 

Plan:
The patient is being treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin (Vanc), zosyn (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin (Cipro). Propofol is being held to see if the patient's mental status improves. Sedation is also being held to assess any response from the patient. Hypoglycemia is being managed by providing dextrose-containing fluids as needed. The patient's antihypertensive medications are being held due to a low ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. Low-dose lasix is being started for possible CHF or pneumonia. Anticoag"

   PLAN:
   ====
   Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection while
   unresponsive.  Change in mental status likely due to
   hypoglycemia/pneumonia. Currently on PSV .  has had failed SBTs,
   thought to be due to CHF.
   - Will put patient back on low dose lasix gtt and will use pressors as
   needed with goal of 1-2L negative today
   - Continue empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn/[**Last Name (LF) 1686**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] pull
   off if in am if cultures are negative
   - Off propolfol gtt,  boluses prn for sedation
   Mental status: per report the patient hasn't been awake since the event
   and has currently received sedation.  Head CT negative at OSH.  He has
   been off propofol for >24 hours and has had some recent boluses, but w
   ithout underlying liver or kidney disease it is curious why he hasn
   returned to his basline mental status.  It is unclear how long he was
   down with hypoglycemia.
   - Slightly better mental status this am.  Following simple commands
   - Toxic metabolic workup, negative at this point
   - Will repeat head ct today
   Hypoglycemia: as per report from the patient's wife, he has not been
   eating well at the NH.  This in concordance with current lantus dosing
   may have caused his hypoglycemia.  Patient required D5NS gtt to
   maintain normal blood sugars and these are now normal off fluids.
   - continue to monitor and give D5 prn
   CV: Patient with recent hx of CABG/AVR.
   CAD: Enzymes negative.  Continue ASA, hold statin.  Patient does not
   need anticoagulation
   PUMP: EF 30%, will hold antihypertensives at this time.  Will start on
   Lasix gtt and start with pressors as needed. Still hypervolemic on
   exam.
   RHYTHM: admitted in nsr, although alternating between bigeminy and nsr
    UTI: patient with [**First Name3 (LF) 1686**] sensitive Enterococcus, although with
   intermedaiate sensitivity to Vanc.  Hx of VRE.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who was found unresponsive and intubated for airway protection. He is suspected to have pneumonia and was found to be hypoglycemic. The patient has a history of recent CABG/AVR and CAD, but cardiac enzymes are negative. He has a low ejection fraction (30%) and hypertension. The patient also has a history of sensitive Enterococcus UTI and vancomycin-resistant E. coli (VRE).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This indicates a critical condition that requires close monitoring and management.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension early in the morning, which was addressed by giving 500cc NS. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain stable hemodynamics.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels require careful monitoring and management. It is important to ensure proper glycemic control to prevent further complications.

4. Possible Pneumonia: The patient's condition suggests possible pneumonia, and he has been started on empirical treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Cultures will be monitored to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

5. History of CABG/AVR and CAD: Although cardiac enzymes are negative, the patient's history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and angioplasty (AVR"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 60**] be due previous sedatives that he has received, underlying
   infection, other toxic-metabolic process.
   Check TSH, B12, RPR;  rpt head CT if does not improve off sedation.
   2) Hypoglycemia:
   Etiology unclear, possible poor intake with long-acting insulin.
   Evaluate for hypothyroidism.
   3) Pneumonia:
   Radiographically may have an infiltrate though there are no clinical
   signs of infection.
   Would treat for HCAP, check sputum culture.
   4) CHF:
   Diuresis with lasix gtt.
   The pleural effusions are consistent with CHF given b/l nature and
   presence of interstitial edema.
   5) Respiratory Failure:
   [**Month (only) 60**] be a combination of CHF and pneumonia.
   Will attempt diurese and retry SBT.
   6) Elevated LFTs:
   There is no evidence of obstruction on CT chest--f/u final read.
   Likely for congestive hepatopathy.
   Repeat LFTs later today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status, hypoglycemia, pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), respiratory failure, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and diuretics. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities and the presence of pleural effusions. Further diagnostic tests and interventions are planned to evaluate and manage the patient's conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can potentially worsen and lead to sepsis or other systemic infections.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, potentially leading to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's CHF may progress, leading to worsening cardiac output and potential arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated LFTs indicate possible liver injury, which can be due to various causes including sepsis, medications, or congestive hepatopathy. Continued monitoring is necessary to assess liver function.
5. Neurological Status: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen, potentially leading to neurological complications such as pressure ulcers, pneumonia, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 60**] be due previous sedatives that he has received, underlying
   infection, other toxic-metabolic process.
   Check TSH, B12, RPR;  rpt head CT if does not improve off sedation.
   2) Hypoglycemia:
   Etiology unclear, possible poor intake with long-acting insulin.
   Evaluate for hypothyroidism.
   3) Pneumonia:
   Radiographically may have an infiltrate though there are no clinical
   signs of infection.
   Would treat for HCAP, check sputum culture.
   4) CHF:
   Diuresis with lasix gtt.
   The pleural effusions are consistent with CHF given b/l nature and
   presence of interstitial edema.
   5) Respiratory Failure:
   [**Month (only) 60**] be a combination of CHF and pneumonia.
   Will attempt diurese and retry SBT.
   6) Elevated LFTs:
   There is no evidence of obstruction on CT chest--f/u final read.
   Likely for congestive hepatopathy.
   Repeat LFTs later today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypoglycemia, pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), respiratory failure, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. Lorazepam is being used for sedation, and heparin sodium is being administered as prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/39 to 119/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,669 mL and output of 3,055 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,386 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with set tidal volume (Vt) of 0 mL, spontaneous Vt of 344 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 106, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 13 cmH2O,"

   - Slightly better mental status this am.  Following simple commands
   - Toxic metabolic workup, negative at this point
   - Repeat Head CT negative
   Hypoglycemia: likely due to poor PO intake without changes in insulin
   regimen.  Glucose levels have been WNL in the absence of insulin,
   although patient has not been getting nutrition.
   - continue to monitor a

   Assessment and Plan
   79M found unresponsive, intubated for airway protection, found to be
   hypoglycemic with possible pneumonia
   PLAN:
   ====
   Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection while
   unresponsive.  Change in mental status likely due to
   hypoglycemia/pneumonia. Currently on PSV .  has had failed SBTs,
   thought to be due to CHF.
   - Will put patient back on low dose lasix gtt and will use pressors as
   needed with goal of 1-2L negative today
   - Continue empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn/[**Last Name (LF) 1686**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] pull
   off if in am if cultures are negative
   - Off propolfol gtt,  boluses prn for sedation
   Mental status: per report the patient hasn't been awake since the event
   and has currently received sedation.  Head CT negative at OSH.  He has
   been off propofol for >24 hours and has had some recent boluses, but w
   ithout underlying liver or kidney disease it is curious why he hasn
   returned to his basline mental status.  It is unclear how long he was
   down with hypoglycemia.
   - Slightly better mental status this am.  Following simple commands
   - Toxic metabolic workup, negative at this point
   - Will repeat head ct today
   Hypoglycemia: as per report from the patient's wife, he has not been
   eating well at the NH.  This in concordance with current lantus dosing
   may have caused his hypoglycemia.  Patient required D5NS gtt to
   maintain normal blood sugars and these are now normal off fluids.
   - continue to monitor and give D5 prn
   CV: Patient with recent hx of CABG/AVR.
   CAD: Enzymes negative.  Continue ASA, hold statin.  Patient does not
   need anticoagulation
   PUMP: EF 30%, will hold antihypertensives at this time.  Will start on
   Lasix gtt and start with pressors as needed. Still hypervolemic on
   exam.
   RHYTHM: admitted in nsr, although alternating between bigeminy and nsr
    UTI: patient with [**First Name3 (LF) 1686**] sensitive Enterococcus, although with
   intermedaiate sensitivity to Vanc.  Hx of VRE.
   - coverage for HAP should cover this organims
   - follow-up urine culture

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male who was found unresponsive and intubated for airway protection. He has a history of possible pneumonia and hypoglycemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (112/45 mmHg), indicating potential hypotension.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient had a previous episode of hypoglycemia and is at risk for further episodes.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has possible pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.

5. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CABG/AVR and reduced ejection fraction (30%), indicating potential cardiac complications.

6. UTI: The patient has a history of sensitive Enterococcus and intermediate sensitivity to vancomycin, which increases the risk of urinary tract infection.

7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response could indicate delirium, which needs to be addressed and managed appropriately.

8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheterization.

9. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who recently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was found unresponsive at a nursing home with low blood sugar and has since been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and volume overload. There is also a concern for an aspiration pneumonia (asp PNA), for which he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Other issues mentioned in the note include:
1. Mental status improvement: The patient is now following commands and sedation will be managed with propofol.
2. Hypoglycemia: Resolved.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an enterococcal UTI, which was treated with ciprofloxacin until the last day.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 30% and will receive Lasix drips to aim for a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted due to persistent chest pain and diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2180-10-5**]. The patient was found unresponsive at a nursing home with low blood sugar and has been slow to clear mental status. He is also suspected to have aspiration pneumonia (asp PNA) and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and volume overload. The treatment goals include netting out 1 liter of fluids, augmenting cardiac output with neomycin, and conducting follow-up culture data from sputum. The patient will be given a sedative for mental status improvement and will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) tomorrow.

The patient has been diagnosed with enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI) and heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. Lasix is being administered as a continuous infusion to achieve output of 1-2 liters today. There have been episodes of bigeminy, and magnesium and potassium levels are being optimized with the goal of maintaining K > 4 and Mg > 2. Beta blockers and lisinopril are being held for now, while ASA is being continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure due to HAP and volume overload. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support may be required.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's risk of developing further aspiration pneumonia is high due to his altered mental status. Adequate airway protection and proper positioning should be maintained.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction is significantly reduced, indicating a high risk of heart failure exacerbation. Monitoring fluid balance, administering diuretics as needed, and managing cardiac output are crucial.
4. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a possibility of developing antibiotic resistance or new infections. Regular assessment of vital signs and laboratory parameters, along with appropriate antibiotic therapy, is essential.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced episodes of bigeminy. Continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm and prompt intervention for any arrhythmias are necessary.
6. Malnutrition: The patient has not been receiving adequate nutrition orally. Initiation of tube feeds is recommended to prevent malnutrition.
7. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be carefully monitored and managed to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for developing DVT and"

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on October 5th. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and hypoglycemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/45 to 135/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 485 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 100 to 157 mg/dL.

24-hour events include the placement of a left internal jugular vein catheter, an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 35%, administration of Lasix gtt overnight, and an increase in nebulized epinephrine with an increase in urine output. Sputum culture samples have been sent, and the patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2180-10-5**]. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) and was found unresponsive at a nursing home with low blood sugar. He is currently in the ICU due to persistent chest pain, ruling in for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and has a concern for aspiration pneumonia (asp PNA) being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with volume overload. The goal is to net negative out 1L with nebulized normal saline (Neo) to augment cardiac output (CO). Antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro) have been initiated since [**12-5**] (day 1), and follow-up culture data from sputum is expected. If secretions worsen, a bronchoscopy may be necessary.

The patient's mental status has improved today and is following commands. Propofol sedation will be minimized. The patient previously experienced hypoglycemia, which has been resolved. There is also a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by enterococcal bacteria on [**12-2**] (last day of ciprofloxacin). The patient's heart failure (CHF) is managed with furosemide (Lasix) and aims to output 1-2 L today. Some episodes of bigeminy have occurred, and efforts will be made to optimize magnesium and potassium levels. Beta-blockers and lisinopril are currently held, while aspirin (ASA) is continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a concern for HAP and volume overload. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygenation, and respiratory mechanics will be necessary. Treatment strategies include minimizing fluid intake, augmenting CO, and considering bronchoscopy if secretions worsen.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's risk factors, there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and following up with sputum culture data will be crucial. If necessary, a bronchoscopy may aid in diagnosis and management.
3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): Due to the prolonged hospital stay and presence of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing HAP. Continuous surveillance of respiratory status and adherence to infection control practices are essential.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although the previous UTI has been treated, ongoing monitoring for signs of infection, especially in the urinary tract, is necessary."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who recently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with aortic valve replacement. He was found unresponsive at a nursing home with low blood sugar and is now admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. There are concerns about potential complications such as hypoglycemia, urinary tract infection, and fluid overload. The goal is to extubate the patient today and transition to non-invasive positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support.

The patient's mental status has improved, and he is now following commands. His hypoglycemia has resolved, but there is a history of enterococcal urinary tract infection. The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 30% and is receiving furosemide (Lasix) to manage fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure due to potential hospital-acquired pneumonia and fluid overload.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate inadequate perfusion and could lead to organ dysfunction.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has experienced episodes of bigeminy, indicating possible cardiac instability, and there is a need to optimize magnesium"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old male who was found unresponsive and intubated for airway protection. The patient was hypoglycemic with possible pneumonia. The patient's conditions and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is extubated and currently doing well. However, there is a concern for respiratory distress, so noninvasive ventilation (NIMV) may be initiated if necessary. The patient's respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device (endotracheal tube), ventilator mode (PSV/SBT), tidal volume (Vt), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2).

2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance, aiming for a negative balance of -1.5L today. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 30%, and antihypertensives are being held at this time.

3. Mental status: The patient follows complex commands, indicating improvement in mental status from being unresponsive initially.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient was initially hyp"

","The patient is a 79-year-old male who was found unresponsive and intubated for airway protection due to hypoglycemia and possible pneumonia. He has a history of acute on chronic heart failure and is suspected to have hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration. He is currently extubated and talking without complaints.

The patient's agitation is being managed with Zyprexa at a dose of 2.5 mg PRN, and further evaluation of his baseline mental status is recommended. His hypoglycemia is being monitored closely with QID fingersticks, and his diabetes medication regimen needs to be reassessed.

The patient recently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement. His cardiac function is compromised with an ejection fraction of 30%. Anticoagulation therapy is not required post valve replacement.

The patient was previously treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with ciprofloxacin but has completed the course. He is currently on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen central venous line. The plan is to attempt peripheral intravenous access today and remove the central venous line.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to acute on chronic heart failure and possible pneumonia, agitation, hypoglycemia, and urinary tract infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male who was found unresponsive and intubated for airway protection. He was diagnosed with possible pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic systolic CHF, recent CABG/AVR, and CAD. The patient's mental status is currently normal, and his hypoglycemia has resolved. He is being treated for various conditions including UTI, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support and has been extubated. His current vital signs are within normal range, and his lab results show some abnormalities such as elevated WBC, slightly low Hct, and elevated troponin-T levels. The plan is to continue diuresis to aim for a negative fluid balance, monitor for any complications, and provide appropriate care and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient was found to have possible pneumonia, which could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased sputum production, fever, and potentially progress to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. There is a risk of recurrence if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has a history of chronic systolic CHF, and there is a potential for exacerbation due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who was found unresponsive at Hospital1 with a fever of 39 degrees Celsius and admitted for pneumonia. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and received multiple antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 110/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure is within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1655 mL, including 761 mL of intravenous fluids, and an output of 3530 mL, consisting of 420 mL of urine. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a non-rebreather mask with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds with a well-healed midline scar, and absence of peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient is confused but interactive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show a glucose level of 110 mg/dL, white blood cell count of 299 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 376, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, total CO2 of 28 mmHg, and troponin-T of 0.08. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status, resolved hypoglycemia, and congestive heart failure. The plan includes administering Zyprexa for agitation, weaning off oxygen, completing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam courses, resuming home per oral lasix dose, and transferring the patient to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who recently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and aortic valve replacement. He was found unresponsive at the hospital with a low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia) and was intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has been in the MICU and is now extubated. He is tolerating a regular diet and is being followed by the fasting service.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced an episode of hypoglycemia, which can be potentially life-threatening if not promptly treated. It is important to monitor his blood sugar levels closely and adjust insulin requirements accordingly.
2. Delirium: The patient exhibited altered mental status and agitation, indicating possible delirium. Appropriate measures should be taken to manage his symptoms and prevent further complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions and patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has small bilateral pleural effusions, indicating potential CHF. His cardiac function should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions such as diuretics may be required.
5. Line-related complications: The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and central venous line. Regular assessment and"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 79-year-old male who was found unresponsive at [**Hospital1 169**] with a fever of 39 degrees Celsius. He was admitted for pneumonia.
- The patient was intubated on [**2180-12-8**] at 12:00 PM and extubated on the same day.
- On the night shift, the patient was agitated and required Zyprexa for sedation.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The patient received multiple antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin.
- The patient is receiving Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems shows fatigue and unchanged review of systems from admission except as noted below.
- Flowsheet data indicates that the patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 110/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, fluid balance is negative 1875 mL, and total fluid intake is 1653 mL.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG reading of 7.48/42/72/28/6.
- Physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, and a well-healed midline scar. The patient is oriented, interactive, and follows simple commands.
- Laboratory results show normal levels for hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and liver enzymes.
- Imaging shows bilateral pleural effusions and cardiomegaly.
- Microbiology results are negative.
- The patient's conditions include altered mental status (delirium), hypoglycemia (resolved), and congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The plan includes continuing Zyprexa for agitation, discontinuing Cipro, completing Vancomycin/Zosyn (day 5 of 7), weaning O2 as tolerated, and transferring to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can increase the risk of falls, self-removal of tubes or lines, and other complications related to confusion and disorientation.
2. Infection: Despite negative microbiology results, the presence of bilateral pleural effusions and patchy infiltrates on imaging suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Fluid imbalance: The negative fluid balance indicates that the patient is losing more fluids than he is receiving. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can increase the risk of organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and there are bilateral pleural effusions on imaging. This could indicate respiratory distress or pneumonia, potentially requiring additional respiratory support or intervention.
6. Cardiac issues: The presence of cardiomegaly on imaging suggests underlying cardiac dysfunction, which may contribute to the patient's CHF and increase the risk of cardiac complications.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the"
