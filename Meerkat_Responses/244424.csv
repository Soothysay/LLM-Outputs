   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent complicated hospitalization, and large-volume gastrointestinal bleeding while at a rehabilitation center. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but continues to experience hematochezia. Central venous catheters have been placed, and the patient is receiving intravenous fluids for resuscitation. The patient's medications, including aspirin, Plavix, and heparin, have been held. The patient's blood products are being transfused to maintain a hematocrit level above 30%, and serial hematocrit checks are being performed. The patient's coagulation status, fibrinogen levels, electrolytes, and platelets will be monitored due to the large volume of transfusion.

The patient's abdominal pain is described as vague upper abdominal pain. The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which could be due to cephalosporin antibiotics, proton pump inhibitor therapy, or dilutional effects from the large volume of transfusion. Cefazolin has been held, and platelets will be transfused for a count below 50,000.

The patient has a right groin wound, which may be infected. Wound care services will be consulted regarding general care and possible infection treatment. There are no signs of infection at this time. The patient's history of coronary artery disease shows no evidence of active cardiac ischemia recently. Aspirin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent complicated hospitalization, and large-volume gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but continues to have hematochezia. A central venous catheter (CVC) was placed by interventional radiology (IR) last night, and no source of bleeding was seen in the IR study. The patient is planned for a colonoscopy this morning. The patient has allergies to penicillins, methyldopa, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and Tylenol (oral). The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other medications.

24-hour events include receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (prbc) and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) yesterday. The patient continues to have hematochezia, and the source of bleeding is still unclear. The patient has a history of recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and atrial fibrillation, which are currently being managed. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, which may be due to cephalosporin, PPI treatment, or dilutional related to large transfusion. The patient's right groin wound is being evaluated for possible infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and was transferred to the ICU for evaluation and management. The patient has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 1 unit of platelets, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to significant bleeding and resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to the 50s, which may be related to significant bleeding and resuscitation with PRBCs alone. Close monitoring of platelet levels is necessary, and further platelet transfusion may be required.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, likely secondary to resuscitation with normal saline and blood in the absence of free water. D5W at 50 cc/hr is being administered to correct the sodium imbalance, and advancing the diet to clear liquids after the colonoscopy will help regulate sodium levels.

3. R femoral wound: Necrotic tissue is present around the prior thrombus site, and a wound care consult has been requested. Vascular surgery consultation is also pending due to the presence of necrotic tissue.

4. COPD exacerbation: The patient is on home oxygen and steroids,"

   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She appears to have needed less pRBC support over past 24 hrs. She did
   develop chest heaviness over the last day but had responded to lasix
   and morphine bolus therapy. She has diminished breath sound at both
   bases and minimal wheezing. Her right groin wound does not appear to be
   bleeding. Tagged nuclear study did not show features of acute GI blood
   loss. Mildly elevated troponin raises concerns of ongoing demand
   ischemia. There are no new worrisome EKG changes
   She awaits colonoscopy today. We will also continue to cycle troponin
   and cardiac enzymes and keep Hct greater than 30 at all times.
   Unfortunately she has fixed coronary disease not amenable to PCI. We
   will keep HR control optimized at all times. If she rebleeds, IR or
   surgical options will be considered again in that order provided
   colonoscopy shows area of possible bleed.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She required 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), as well as one unit of platelets due to thrombocytopenia. The tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan showed positive findings for colonic bleeding. The patient underwent interventional radiology (IR)-guided embolization, which was unsuccessful. A plan for colonoscopy has been made.

The patient also has a history of a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in 07/2018 without stents, for which she was taking aspirin and Plavix. She experienced episodes of chest pain overnight without EKG changes in the setting of tachycardia. Troponins are slowly rising, indicating ongoing myocardial ischemia. The patient's atrial fibrillation episodes responded well to lopressor.

The patient's platelet count decreased to 50s yesterday but has now stabilized after a single platelet transfusion. She experienced episodes of dyspnea and mild desaturations overnight, which improved with lasix and ativan. These symptoms are likely related to significant volume resuscitation for GI bleeding"

   after single platelet transfusion.
   - monitor platelets
   - cefazolin discontinued
   Dyspnea: patient with episodes of dyspnea and mild desaturations
   overnight which improved with lasix and ativan.  Likely related to
   significant volume resuscitation for GI bleeding.
   - low dose IV lasix with transfusions as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and was transferred to the ICU for evaluation and management. The patient required blood transfusions and fluid resuscitation due to significant bleeding. She has experienced multiple medical complications including thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, hypernatremia, and chest pain. The patient's current condition requires close monitoring and management of her various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count decreased significantly during the period of bleeding and resuscitation with packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Close monitoring of platelet levels is essential to prevent further complications related to low platelet count.

2. Dyspnea: The patient has episodes of dyspnea and mild desaturations, which improved with lasix and ativan. This suggests that the patient may have fluid overload due to transfusions. Careful monitoring and management of fluid balance are necessary to prevent further respiratory distress.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely secondary to resuscitation with normal saline and blood products in the absence of free water. It is important to provide D5W at 50 cc/hr while awaiting colonoscopy and advance the diet to clears after the procedure to allow thirst to regulate sodium levels.

   one unit of platelets since arrival at [**Hospital1 5**] and had 6 U PRBC and 4 U
   FFP at [**Hospital3 **].  Embolization here was unsuccessful.  Colonoscopy with
   many diverticuli, but no active bleeding.

   CAD: S/P NSTEMI in [**7-/2185**] without stents.  Was on ASA, plavix.  Having
   periods of chest pain overnight without EKG changes in the setting of
   tachycardia.  Now with flat CKS and MBs but with slowly rising
   troponins.
   - continue to hold ASA and plavix in the setting of bleeding
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg TID for rapid atrial fibrillation and
   NSTEMI
   - continue simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - trend cardiac enzymes until troponins are declining
   Hypotension:   Patient hypotensive overnight with marginal UOP.
   Presumed hypovolemic.  Bolused total of 1.5 L with 1.3 L of UOP over 24
   hrs. Other etiologies include infectious, hemorrhagic although
   hematocrit is stable.
   - Continue PRN boluses as needed to target SBP and urine output.
   Follow O2 sats and lung exam.
   - transduce CVP if continues to be hypotensive\
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   Atrial fibrillation: Episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation earlier in
   course which responded well to lopressor.
   - continue amiodarone
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg TID with holding parameters
   Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased to 50s day after arrival in the
   setting of significant bleeding and resuscitation with PRBCs alone.
   Now stable after single platelet transfusion.
   - monitor platelets
   - cefazolin discontinued
   Dyspnea: patient with episodes of dyspnea and mild desaturations 24
   hours ago which was treated with lasix and ativan.  CXr with
   questionable worsening volume overload but other parameters suggest
   that she is intravascularly dry.
   - rate control of atrial fibrillation with metoprolol and amioadarone
   - continue home inhalers for COPD, steroids
   - titrate o2 sats to 88%
   COPD: On home O2 and steroid dependent. Currently on prednisone taper.
   Patient more dyspneic 24 hours ago in the setting of rapid atrial
   fibrillation and possible volume overload from transfusions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and was transferred to the ICU for evaluation and possible interventional radiology-guided embolization. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 1 unit of platelets since arrival. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon but no active bleeding. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she requires ongoing monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive overnight with marginal urine output. This is presumed to be hypovolemic due to blood loss from the lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has received a total of 1.5 liters of fluid boluses with 1.3 liters of urine output over 24 hours. Other etiologies include infectious and hemorrhagic causes, although the hematocrit is stable. Further management includes continuing PRN boluses as needed to target systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urine output, following oxygen saturation levels, and trending cardiac enzymes.

2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient may have an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which is indicated by the presence of hypernatremia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, COPD, and atrial fibrillation. He underwent a colonoscopy and experienced hypotension, leading to the administration of blood products and fluids. The patient also has an open wound with a vacuum-assisted closure, which is infected with pseudomonas. He has received antibiotics for this infection. The patient has been receiving various medications, including beta-blockers and statins for elevated troponin levels and chest pain. His allergies include penicillins, methyldopa, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and Tylenol. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing low urine output and hypotension. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin levels. Imaging reveals right upper lobe opacities consistent with aspiration and minimal bilateral pleural effusion. The patient's current assessment includes hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, thrombocytopenia, COPD, gastrointestinal bleed, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and impaired glycemic control. The patient's care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   CAD: S/P NSTEMI in [**7-/2182**] without stents.  Was on ASA, plavix.  Having
   periods of chest pain overnight without EKG changes in the setting of
   tachycardia.  Now with flat CKS and MBs but with slowly rising
   troponins.
   - continue to hold ASA and plavix in the setting of bleeding
   - will restart metoprolol 25 mg TID for rapid atrial fibrillation and
   NSTEMI
   - restart simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - trend cardiac enzymes until troponins are declining
   - consider cardiology consult
   Atrial fibrillation: Episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation overnight
   which responded well to lopressor.
   - amiodarone restarted
   - will restart metoprolol 25 mg TID with holding parameters
   Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased to 50s yesterday in the setting
   of significant bleeding and resuscitation with PRBCs alone.  Now stable
   after single platelet transfusion.
   - monitor platelets
   - cefazolin discontinued
   Dyspnea: patient with episodes of dyspnea and mild desaturations
   overnight which improved with lasix and ativan.  Likely related to
   significant volume resuscitation for GI bleeding.
   - low dose IV lasix with transfusions as needed
   - metoprolol for rapid atrial fibrillation
   COPD: On home O2 and steroid dependent. Currently on prednisone taper.
   Patient more dyspneic overnight in the setting of rapid atrial
   fibrillation and possible volume overload from transfusions.

   - Nebs PRN
   Hypernatremia:  Likely secondary to resuscitation with normal saline,
   blood in absence of free water.
   - D5W @ 50 cc/hr while awaiting colonoscopy
   - advance diet to clears after procedure if able to allow thirst to
   regulate sodium

   Imaging: CXR [**2185-8-26**]: The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The pacemaker
   lead is in the right atrium
   with no right ventricle pacemaker lead demonstrated, unchanged since
   the prior
   study. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.
   There
   is interval progression of the right upper lobe opacities that might be
   consistent with recent aspiration giving the rapidity of the changes.
   The
   bibasilar linear opacities consistent with atelectasis most likely are
   unchanged. There is minimal bilateral pleural effusion with no
   significant change since the prior study.

   and is transfered from [**Hospital3 57**] Hospital for evaluation for IR
   guided embolization.
   Lower GI Bleed: Presented with BRBPR.  Tagged RBC scan positive at [**Hospital **] for L colonic bleeding.  She has required 9 U PRBC and 2 U FFP and
   one unit of platelets since arrival at [**Hospital1 5**] and had 7 U PRBC and 4 U
   FFP at [**Hospital3 **].  Embolization here was unsuccessful.  Colonoscopy with
   many diverticuli, but no active bleeding.
   - active type and screen
   - hematocrit stable overnight
   - Q6 hour hematocrits today
   - R IJ in place
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u GI, surgery, IR recs

   CAD: S/P NSTEMI in [**7-/2185**] without stents.  Was on ASA, plavix.  Having
   periods of chest pain overnight without EKG changes in the setting of
   tachycardia.  Now with flat CKS and MBs but with slowly rising
   troponins.
   - continue to hold ASA and plavix in the setting of bleeding
   - will restart metoprolol 25 mg TID for rapid atrial fibrillation and
   NSTEMI
   - restart simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - trend cardiac enzymes until troponins are declining
   - consider cardiology consult
   Hypotension:   Patient hypotensive overnight with marginal UOP.
   Presumed hypovolemic.  Bolused total of 1.5 L with 1.3 L of UOP over 24
   hrs. Other etiologies include infectious, hemorrhagic.
   - Continue PRN boluses as needed.  Follow O2 sats and lung exam.
   - transduce CVP if continues to be hypotensive
   -
   Atrial fibrillation: Episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation overnight
   which responded well to lopressor.
   - amiodarone restarted
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg TID with holding parameters
   Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased to 50s day after arrival in the
   setting of significant bleeding and resuscitation with PRBCs alone.
   Now stable after single platelet transfusion.
   - monitor platelets
   - cefazolin discontinued
   Dyspnea: patient with episodes of dyspnea and mild desaturations
   overnight which improved with lasix and ativan.  Likely related to
   significant volume resuscitation for GI bleeding.
   - low dose IV lasix with transfusions as needed
   - metoprolol for rapid atrial fibrillation
   COPD: On home O2 and steroid dependent. Currently on prednisone taper.
   Patient more dyspneic overnight in the setting of rapid atrial
   fibrillation and possible volume overload from transfusions.
   - continue ipratropium and advair, d/c tiotropium
   - slow methylpred taper as patient has been on steroids for extended
   periods of time (currently at 10 mg daily)

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (A-fib), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) since admission, with an additional 7 units of PRBCs and 4 units of FFP at the referring hospital. Embolization was attempted but unsuccessful, and a colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis but no active bleeding. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination is notable for faint pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, and a right femoral wound with necrotic tissue. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, platelet count of 106, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels ranging from 0.09 to 0.25 ng/mL. Imaging studies reveal the NG tube tip in the stomach, pacemaker lead in the right atrium, and interval progression of right upper lobe opacities consistent with recent aspiration. The patient's medical complications include hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute thrombocytopenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation, gastrointestinal bleed, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and necrotic tissue around the prior thrombus site in the right femoral wound. The patient's current plan includes restarting metoprolol for rapid atrial fibrillation and NSTEMI, restarting simvastatin, continuing cardiac enzyme trend until troponins are declining, considering cardiology consult, and monitoring for potential complications such as infections, hemorrhagic events, and respiratory distress."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was transferred from an outside hospital with bloody rectal bleeding, tagged cell scan confirming colonic source, and received a massive transfusion. The source of GIB remains unclear, possibly related to diverticulosis. She underwent colonoscopy and received 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the past without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She is not currently on antiplatelet medication. Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia likely due to dilutional effects from the massive transfusion. She has a right femoral wound infected with pseudomonas, for which she underwent debridement and is now on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has a history of COPD exacerbation and is currently wheezy on examination. She is being weaned off ventilatory support and transitioned to oral steroids. The patient's nutrition is being advanced to full enteral feeds. She is being closely monitored in the ICU for various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient's GIB source is still unclear, and there is a possibility of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding from the colonic source.
2. Infection: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), who has undergone multiple interventions including transfusion, angiography, and colonoscopy. She has been diagnosed with diverticulosis but no active bleeding was found during the colonoscopy. The patient has also experienced hypotension and low urine output, for which she received bolus infusions of fluids. She has a history of bronchitis exacerbation and is currently on a tapering dose of prednisone. Additionally, she has a wound infection caused by pseudomonas, which has been debrided and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) with a previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which she was not treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She is currently on hold from taking aspirin and Plavix. Thrombocytopenia is suspected to be dilutional but will be monitored, and alternative etiologies such as antibiotic-associated thrombocytopenia or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) will be considered if necessary. The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and is transitioning to oral prednisone. She has a femoral wound that has undergone debridement and is now being treated with antibiotics.

   periods of chest pain overnight without EKG changes in the setting of
   tachycardia.  Now with flat CKS and MBs but with slowly rising
   troponins.
   - continue to hold ASA and plavix in the setting of bleeding
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg TID for rapid atrial fibrillation and
   NSTEMI
   - continue simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - trend cardiac enzymes until troponins are declining
   Hypotension:  Patient relatively normotensive now with marginal UOP.
   - Will hold further boluses as likely baseline.
   R femoral wound: necrotic tissue present around prior thrombus site

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and was transferred to the hospital for evaluation for interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization. The patient has required multiple blood transfusions and has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive overnight with marginal urine output. It is presumed to be hypovolemic due to bleeding and ongoing fluid losses. The patient has been given boluses of fluids but remains hypotensive. Other potential causes of hypotension include infectious and hemorrhagic causes, although the hematocrit is stable.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance of electrolytes and fluids, which may be due to fluid resuscitation and ongoing losses.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to the 50s after significant bleeding and resuscitation with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) alone. A single platelet transfusion has stabilized the platelet count.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has necrotic tissue around the prior thrombus site in the right femoral wound.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which was confirmed by a tagged"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and impaired skin integrity. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleed, and AFIB. The patient has been receiving various medications, including Ciprofloxacin, Meropenem, lorazepam, and methylprednisolone. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,034 mL and output of 400 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,634 mL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, which may indicate hypotension. This could be due to his underlying conditions or medication side effects. Monitoring and adjusting the fluid intake and vasopressor support may be necessary.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's labs show imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. These imbalances need to be corrected to maintain proper electrolyte balance and prevent any complications related to fluid management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and was transferred from another hospital for evaluation for interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization. 

The patient required 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) since arrival at this hospital, as well as one unit of platelets. A colonoscopy showed many diverticuli but no active bleeding. Embolization was unsuccessful. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, possibly due to hypovolemia from bleeding, as well as electrolyte and fluid disorders. She also has thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and impaired skin integrity. 

The patient's past medical history includes a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) without stents, for which she was on aspirin and Plavix. She experienced chest pain overnight without EKG changes in the setting of tachycardia, and her cardiac enzymes are slowly rising. 

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, simvastatin, and amiodarone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and presumed hypov"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and was transferred to the ICU for evaluation and potential intervention. The patient required blood transfusions due to the bleeding and also experienced episodes of hypotension and chest pain, which were managed with fluid resuscitation and medication adjustments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and the need for fluid resuscitation indicate a risk of ongoing hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output is necessary.
2. Infection: The presence of necrotic tissue in the patient's femoral wound increases the risk of infection. The wound culture results indicate resistance to certain antibiotics, so appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on sensitivity.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count decreased significantly after transfusions with packed red blood cells. Close monitoring of platelet count is important to assess for ongoing bleeding risk.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of COPD and recent episodes of dyspnea and desaturation suggest a risk of respiratory complications. Monitoring oxygen saturation and adjusting respiratory support as needed is important.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent episodes of chest pain with rising cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing cardiac ischemia. Continuous monitoring of cardiac enzymes and"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU with a femoral wound infection and necrotic tissue, along with a history of recent antibiotic use including ciprofloxacin and meropenem. The patient's current vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with pale conjunctiva and clear oropharynx. 

Physical examination reveals irregular heart rhythm, diminished breath sounds throughout the lungs, and faint pulses in the extremities. The patient has a right femoral wound with necrotic tissue and a right lower extremity wound after fasciotomy. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 110,000/uL, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute thrombocytopenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gastrointestinal bleed, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and impaired renal function. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hospitalization (Hospital 7812) who was transferred from an outside hospital with BRBPR (blood and/or body fluids in the urine without an obvious cause), tagged cell scan showing a colonic source, and underwent a massive transfusion and colonoscopy. She reports feeling well, experiencing mild shortness of breath but largely unchanged. 

24-hour events include changing to oral prednisone, receiving a 500 cc bolus for low urine output, and undergoing multiple lab tests. 

The patient has several medical conditions including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with an unclear source, possibly diverticular, and received 15 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 6 fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 1 platelet (PLT) transfusion. Surgery is planned to address the GIB. 

The patient also has low urine output, which has not improved with intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus. Her blood pressure remains adequate to mildly elevated. It is noted that the patient likely has low baseline urine output due to her low muscle mass. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in [**7-19**] without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and she is not taking aspirin or clopidogrel (ASA/plav"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to a colonic source, who underwent massive transfusion and colonoscopy. She reports feeling well, with mild shortness of breath but no significant changes. The patient has allergies to penicillins, methyldopa, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and Tylenol. She has been receiving various medications including prednisone, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and pantoprazole. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/64 mmHg to 147/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is paced at 70 bpm with regular S1 and S2, no murmurs or gallops, and no tenderness. The patient has diffuse wheezing in both lungs, a vacuum dressing in the right groin, and medial and lateral tibial fasciotomies. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 11.6-15.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4-12.3 g/dL, platelet count of 110-"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of hospitalization for bloody bowel movements, tagged cell scan indicating a colonic source, massive transfusion, and colonoscopy. She was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear source, possibly diverticular. The patient has received 15 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 6 fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 1 platelet (PLT) transfusion. She is currently undergoing surgery. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level is being maintained above 30 due to ischemia. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) on 07/19 without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She is holding both aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel (plavix). The patient's troponin levels are being trended. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR) and is being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol. The patient is not chronically anticoagulated and is currently paced. The patient's platelet count is low but stable, likely due to dilutional effect from the massive transfusion. If the platelet count continues to drop, alternative causes such as antibiotic use, heparin-induced thromb"
