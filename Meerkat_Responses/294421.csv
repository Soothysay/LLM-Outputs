","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome admitted to the OSH and transferred to the ICU for further evaluation. He has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia), renal failure (chronic renal failure), impaired skin integrity, anemia, cellulitis in the left lower extremity, right elbow abrasion, chylothorax, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is characterized by an infection of the lungs acquired during a hospital stay. The organism causing the infection is not yet identified, so appropriate antibiotics have been started empirically. Monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will help determine the causative organism and guide further treatment.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. His serum creatinine levels have trended upward overnight, indicating worsening renal function. Renal consultation has been requested for further evaluation and management. Avoidance of nephrotoxins, renal dosing of medications, and follow-up with a nephrologist are recommended.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, as evidenced by 3+ pitting edema bilaterally, cellulitis in the left lower extremity, and skin tears. This may increase the risk of infection."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. He has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and is currently hemodynamically stable. The medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Treatment includes antibiotics such as Vanc and Zosyn, sputum and blood cultures, chest X-ray, and urine Legionella test.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's serum creatinine levels were elevated upon discharge (3.8) with a BUN of 60. There is a trend of increasing creatinine overnight. To manage this condition, nephrotoxins should be avoided, medications should be dosed based on renal function, midodrine should be continued, and octreotide will be started. Albumin will be administered at a rate of 1.5 mg/kg today and 1 mg/kg on day 3. Urinalysis, urine eosinophils, and sediment analysis will be done to look for any other processes contributing to worsening renal function.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has secondary cryptogenic cirrhosis. It is recommended to consider acceptance to the transplant list for liver transplantation. An abdominal ultrasound with Doppler should be performed, and follow-up on OSH paracentesis results is needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and later transferred to the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications, including chronic renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and pneumonia. He also has a chylothorax secondary to cirrhosis, right lower extremity cellulitis, and a right elbow abrasion. The patient's current medications include Vanc and Zosyn for pneumonia, midodrine, and octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome, as well as albumin for paracentesis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his worsening renal function, and consideration should be given to abdominal US with doppler for transplant evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is currently stable hemodynamically. Appropriate antibiotics have been prescribed, and cultures have been obtained for further identification of the causative organism.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's serum creatinine levels have been trending upward, indicating worsening renal function. Measures to avoid nephrotoxins and dose medications accordingly have been implemented. Midodrine and octreotide therapy will continue to support blood pressure and reduce portal hypertension.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level on discharge was 3.8, and his BUN was 60. Ren"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and later transferred to the ICU for further evaluation. The patient has been stable hemodynamically but has shown worsening renal function overnight. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Physical examination reveals crackles in the left base of the lungs, distended but soft abdomen, 3+ pitting edema bilaterally, and warm feet. Neurological examination is normal.

The patient has several medical issues, including pneumonia (healthcare-associated pneumonia), hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis, left carotid endarterectomy, right lower extremity cellulitis, right elbow abrasion, left-sided pleural effusion (chylothorax), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient is also on multiple medications and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has healthcare-associated pneumonia, which needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. There is a risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and possible sepsis if the infection spreads.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has been deteriorating, and there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y.o. male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome was
   admitted to OSH with PNA and transfered here for further evaluation.
   .
   # Pneumonia: HAP given recent admission.  Currently hemodynamically
   stable. CXR with R upper/middle lobe infiltrate. By rounds patient had
   O2 sat 99% on 2L, significantly better than on admission. He has CP
   with coughing, ? contusion from fall that is seen on his CXR and not
   pneumonia.
   - Vanc/zosyn for pneumonia, will continue for now  but would get repeat
   CXR
   - urine legionella negative
   -? Need for sputum culture
   -pt has remained afebrile
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome:  Patient currently on both the liver and kidney
   transplant list. Unclear why LFTs increased on admission. Serum
   Creatinine on discharge here was 3.8 with BUN of 60.  On admission Cr
   over 5, it is unclear if this is purely HRS or if this represents
   intrinsic kidney insult. If this were the case, it would be a separate
   process and thus would make sense for transplanting both organs. At
   this time, his urine output is slowly decreasing and Cr is increasing.
   FeNa is .3, indicating some component of renal disease. Per renal
   service, he is not a candidate for HD at this time but may need to
   consider this option if he becomes symptomatic.
   - monitor UOP
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   - continue midodrine (increase to 10mg), octreotide (increase to
   200mg), and albumin
   -follow LFTs
   .
   # Abdominal Pain/Cirrhosis: Secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis.
   Acceptance to transplant list per liver fellow. At OSH, removed 3L but
   none of the fluid was sent for analysis; yesterday we did a diagnostic
   tap showing WBC 500 PMN 37  and gram stain showing 2+ PMNs. This is not
   consistent with SBP. While it is possible that his hepatic function is
   worsening given LFTs, his abdominal pain may also be secondary to his
   fall; on exam he complains of rib pain. Also, on Doppler there is no
   evidence of thrombosis. At this time, we will continue to follow
   hepatology recommendations and trend his enzymes.
   - liver/transplant following
 appreciate recs
   - f/u paracentesis results
   -consider repeat CXR to evaluate for contusion, rib fractures
   .
   # Anemia
 On admission, drop in Hct from 31.5 -> 23.6. Likely a
   dilutional effect as pt not making urine and has gotten fluids.
   However, his INR is elevated which puts him at risk of bleeding,
   especially in the setting of fall.
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen if hct continues to fall
   - repeat hct in PM w/lytes
   -hold anticoagulation
   .
   # s/p left carotid endarterectomy: well-healed incision

   overnight.  No signs or symptoms of fracture.
   - wound care
   .
   # Left-sided pleural effusion: Chylothorax secondary to cirrhosis.
   - monitor CXR
   - no need for thoracentesis as effusion is recurrent

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and later transferred to the ICU for further evaluation. The patient has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, hepatorenal syndrome, abdominal pain due to cirrhosis, anemia, left lower extremity cellulitis, right elbow abrasion, left-sided pleural effusion (chylothorax), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and there is a concern for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as well. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels and repeat chest X-rays to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and identify any new developments.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): This is a type of kidney failure that occurs in patients with advanced liver disease. The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a concern for worsening renal function. Monitoring urine output, following renal recommendations, avoiding nephrotoxins, and considering hemodialysis (HD) may be necessary.

3. Abdominal Pain/Cirrhosis: The patient's abdominal pain is secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis. His liver function tests ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia and acute kidney injury. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, hyperkalemia, and impaired skin integrity. On admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. Since then, the patient has been receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and heparin sodium. The patient underwent an ultrasound and paracentesis procedure. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,880 mL with 279 mL given as IV fluids. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 96%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of potassium, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated as well. The patient's condition remains critical with ongoing assessments and treatment for pneumonia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest ongoing renal impairment, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly as"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y.o. male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome was
   admitted to OSH with PNA and transfered here for further evaluation.
   .
   # Pneumonia: HAP given recent admission.  Currently hemodynamically
   stable. CXR with R upper/middle lobe infiltrate. By rounds patient had
   O2 sat 99% on 2L, significantly better than on admission. He has CP
   with coughing, ? contusion from fall that is seen on his CXR and not
   pneumonia.
   - Vanc/zosyn for pneumonia, will continue for now  but would get repeat
   CXR
   - urine legionella negative
   -? Need for sputum culture
   -pt has remained afebrile
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome:  Patient currently on both the liver and kidney
   transplant list. Unclear why LFTs increased on admission. Serum
   Creatinine on discharge here was 3.8 with BUN of 60.  On admission Cr
   over 5, it is unclear if this is purely HRS or if this represents
   intrinsic kidney insult. If this were the case, it would be a separate
   process and thus would make sense for transplanting both organs. At
   this time, his urine output is slowly decreasing and Cr is increasing.
   FeNa is .3, indicating some component of renal disease. Per renal
   service, he is not a candidate for HD at this time but may need to
   consider this option if he becomes symptomatic.
   - monitor UOP
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   - continue midodrine (increase to 10mg), octreotide (increase to
   200mg), and albumin
   -follow LFTs
   .
   # Abdominal Pain/Cirrhosis: Secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis.
   Acceptance to transplant list per liver fellow. At OSH, removed 3L but
   none of the fluid was sent for analysis; yesterday we did a diagnostic
   tap showing WBC 500 PMN 37  and gram stain showing 2+ PMNs. This is not
   consistent with SBP. While it is possible that his hepatic function is
   worsening given LFTs, his abdominal pain may also be secondary to his
   fall; on exam he complains of rib pain. Also, on Doppler there is no
   evidence of thrombosis. At this time, we will continue to follow
   hepatology recommendations and trend his enzymes.
   - liver/transplant following
 appreciate recs
   - f/u paracentesis results
   -consider repeat CXR to evaluate for contusion, rib fractures
   .
   # Anemia
 On admission, drop in Hct from 31.5 -> 23.6. Likely a
   dilutional effect as pt not making urine and has gotten fluids.
   However, his INR is elevated which puts him at risk of bleeding,
   especially in the setting of fall.
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen if hct continues to fall
   - repeat hct in PM w/lytes
   -hold anticoagulation
   .
   # s/p left carotid endarterectomy: well-healed incision
   - vascular following
   .
   # Left lower extremity cellulitis:  wound care following, vanco on
   board
   - appreciate wound care recs
   - vanc as above
   .
   # Right elbow abrasion: secondary to slip and hitting his elbow
   overnight.  No signs or symptoms of fracture.
   - wound care
   .
   # Left-sided pleural effusion: Chylothorax secondary to cirrhosis.
   - monitor CXR
   - no need for thoracentesis as effusion is recurrent
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI daily, carafate.
   .
   # FEN: heart healthy diet, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: PPI, lactulose for BMs, pneumo boots

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the OSH with pneumonia and subsequently transferred here for further evaluation.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an upper/middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which suggests a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The plan is to continue these medications and repeat the chest X-ray.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's serum creatinine is elevated, and his urine output is decreasing. He is on midodrine, octreotide, and albumin. His fluid balance is negative due to ongoing fluid losses. The plan is to monitor urine output and follow renal recommendations.
3. Abdominal pain/cirrhosis: The patient has abdominal pain secondary to his cirrhosis. A diagnostic tap showed no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The plan is to follow hepatology recommendations and trend liver enzymes.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 31.5 to 23.6. This could be due to a dilutional effect from fluid administration. The patient is at risk of bleeding, especially with his elevated INR. The plan is to perform a type and screen if the hemoglobin continues to fall.
