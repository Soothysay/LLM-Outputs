","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and a previous allergy to Bactrim. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with suspected septic shock and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. 

24-hour events include central line-related bloodstream infection (CE) negative results, an echocardiogram showing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), normal ejection fraction (EF), moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. The patient received Lasix 20 mg once and had sputum gram stain results positive for GNRs. Vancomycin was discontinued.

The patient's allergies include a rash reaction to Bactrim. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 12:30 AM on 05/24/2198 and Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) at the same time.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 95/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is -1 mmHg. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 68%, and total fluid"

   likely iatrogenic
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely iatrogenic causes, now wearing off. Pt.
   with no events overnight, now much more responsive.  Sputum sample
   shows 4+ GNR, continuing with zosyn.  Advanced to pressure support.
   Will continue to wean as tolerated.  Also treating with prednisone
   60mg, will continue.
   - Cont. Zosyn
   - F/U sputum culture
   - Serial ABG's
   - Wean ventilation
   - Daily CXR
   - Cont. MDI
   # Cardiac:  Echo demonstrates LVH, RA enlargement, mod. Pulm.
   Hypertension/RV enlargement.  Nl EF.  Trops neg. x 3.  Mildly edematous
   on extremities.  Consider gentle diuresis, now that patient has
   seemingly been adequately fluid resuscitated.
   - C/S diuresis
   # Altered Mental Status:  Patient is much more responsive relative to
   yesterday, able to follow commands.  Continue to wean pressure support
   as needed and hold sedation.
   - Wean ventilation as needed.
   # Transaminitis:  In addition, transient elevation of LFT's 3 fold in 4
   hours possibly due to transient ischemia due to hypotension.  Will
   continue to trend.
   - Trend LFT's
   # Falling Hct:  Hct from 39.7 to 32.7, likely dilutional after
   receiving fluid boluses.  Will continue to monitor with serial crits.
   - Repeat Hct in early AM
   # Hypothyroidism:  Will cont. synthroid when OG tube placed
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Will cont. atorvastatin when OG tube placed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy with permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, which were likely caused by iatrogenic factors. The patient is currently being treated for respiratory failure, cardiac issues, altered mental status, transaminitis, falling hemoglobin concentration (Hct), hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma from excessive pressure during ventilation.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. These findings suggest underlying cardiac dysfunction, which can lead to heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to multiple factors such as sedation, hypothyroidism, or sepsis. It is important to monitor for any further changes in mental status, as it may indicate worsening of the underlying condition.

4. Transaminitis: The transient elevation of liver function tests (LFTs) suggests possible transient ischemic attack or hepatocellular injury. Close monitoring of LFTs"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, likely due to an iatrogenic cause. The patient's sputum sample showed 4+ GNR, so he is being treated with Zosyn. His respiratory failure is likely iatrogenic and is wearing off. He has been advanced to pressure support and will continue to be weaned as tolerated. Prednisone 60mg is also being continued.

The patient's cardiac status shows left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. His ejection fraction (EF) is normal, and troponin levels are negative. Mild edema is present on his extremities, and a gentle diuresis is being considered since the patient has been adequately fluid resuscitated.

The patient's altered mental status has improved significantly, as he is now more responsive and able to follow commands. Ventilation support will continue to be weaned as needed.

There is a transient elevation of liver function tests (LFTs) threefold in four hours, which may be due to transient ischemia caused by hypotension. This will be monitored and trended.

The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has decreased from 39.7 to 32"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy.
- He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, likely due to an iatrogenic cause.
- The patient is now more responsive and showing improvement.
- Sputum culture shows 4+ GNR, so he is being treated with Zosyn.
- His respiratory failure is likely iatrogenic and is wearing off. He is being weaned off ventilation support as tolerated.
- He is also being treated with prednisone for unknown reasons.
- The cardiac assessment reveals LVH, RA enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and negative troponin levels. Mild edema is present on extremities, and a gentle diuresis is being considered.
- The patient's altered mental status is improving, and he is able to follow commands.
- There is a transient elevation of liver function tests (LFTs), which may be due to transient ischemia caused by hypotension.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is decreasing, likely due to dilutional effects from receiving fluid boluses.
- He has hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia, for which he is being continued on synthroid and atorvastatin respectively.
- ICU care includes IV fluids, glycemic control, and monitoring of vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, but it is improving as he is being weaned off ventilation support.
2. Infection: The presence of 4+ GNR in the sputum sample indicates a possible infection. The patient is being treated with Zosyn, an antibiotic effective against gram-negative bacteria.
3. Cardiac Issues: The echocardiogram shows LVH, RA enlargement, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. These findings suggest possible cardiac strain or dysfunction. Mild edema on the extremities may indicate fluid retention, and a gentle diuresis is being considered to manage this.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient initially had decreased responsiveness, but it is improving now. Further investigation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause of the altered mental status.
5. Transaminitis: The transient elevation of LFTs suggests possible liver involvement. Monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to identify the cause and determine appropriate management.
6. Anemia: The decreasing hematocrit (Hct) indicates a potential drop in red blood cell count. Monitoring and management are required to address any anemia and its underlying cause.
7. Hypothyroidism and Hyperlipidemia: These conditions require ongoing management with synthroid and atorvastatin respectively."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy with permanent tracheostomy. He is currently in the ICU due to decreased responsiveness and hypotension, likely caused by iatrogenic factors. The patient is showing improvement, with increased responsiveness overnight. The sputum sample shows the presence of 4+ GNR (gram-negative rods), and he is being treated with Zosyn. The patient's respiratory failure is expected to wear off, and ventilation is being weaned as tolerated. He is also receiving prednisone 60mg and will continue to have daily chest X-rays, continue with MDI (medication), and follow-up sputum culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure due to likely iatrogenic causes. However, it is mentioned that the respiratory failure is wearing off, indicating potential improvement.
2. Infection: The presence of 4+ GNR in the sputum sample suggests a possible infection. The patient is being treated with Zosyn, an antibiotic effective against gram-negative bacteria. Continuous monitoring and follow-up cultures are planned to assess the progress of the infection.
3. Cardiac Issues: The echo demonstrates LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy), RA enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and normal ejection fraction. The patient's troponin levels are negative, indicating no acute cardiac"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, likely due to an iatrogenic cause. The patient's respiratory status improved, and he is now more responsive. His blood gas showed some acidosis, so his FiO2 was increased. He is being treated with Zosyn and prednisone. The plan is to continue weaning ventilation and follow up with a sputum culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of coag + staph in the sputum culture indicates a potential infection, which may require further intervention.
3. Cardiac Issues: The echocardiogram shows LVH, RA enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and RV enlargement. The patient has mildly edematous extremities, indicating possible fluid overload. Aggressive diuresis is being pursued to address this issue.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to various factors, including sedation, hypotension, or the underlying condition.
5. Transaminitis: The transient elevation of liver function tests may indicate liver damage or dysfunction, possibly due to transient ischemia caused by hypot"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who has undergone a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy.
- He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, which is believed to be iatrogenic in nature.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, with increased responsiveness and better blood gases.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is being weaned off sedation.
- The patient has hypertension that was initially managed with lisinopril and later with labetalol.
- His cardiac status shows left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and normal ejection fraction.
- Troponin levels are negative, indicating no acute coronary syndrome.
- The patient has mild peripheral edema, and diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance.
- He is also experiencing altered mental status, which is improving with decreased sedation.
- There is a transient elevation in liver function tests, likely due to transient ischemia from hypotension.
- The patient's hematocrit levels are falling, likely due to dilutional effects from fluid boluses.
- He has hypernatremia, which will be managed with free water boluses during diuresis.
- The patient has hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia, for which he is receiving synthroid and atorvastatin respectively.

- The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy.
- He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, likely due to an iatrogenic cause.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation but is showing signs of improvement, with increased responsiveness and better blood gas values.
- A sputum culture showed sparse growth of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, so vancomycin was started.
- The patient's cardiac condition includes left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and normal ejection fraction.
- He is also experiencing altered mental status, which has improved over time, and transaminitis with a transient elevation of liver function tests.
- There is a concern about falling hematocrit levels, possibly due to dilutional effects from fluid boluses.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which may worsen with the administration of Lasix, and will require free water boluses.
- Other medical conditions include hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.
- ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and monitoring for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy.
- He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, which was likely iatrogenic in nature.
- The patient has respiratory failure due to possible causes such as pneumonia or atelectasis, but it is now improving.
- His blood gases show some acidosis, so the FiO2 was increased, and he continues to be more responsive.
- There is sparse growth of coag + staph in the sputum culture, so vancomycin was started.
- The patient's hypertension was managed with lisinopril and labetalol.
- An echocardiogram showed LVH, RA enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and RV enlargement. Troponin-T levels were negative.
- The patient has altered mental status, but he is now more responsive and able to follow commands.
- There is a transient elevation of liver function tests, which could be due to transient ischemia from hypotension.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is falling, likely due to dilutional effects from fluid boluses.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which will be exacerbated by lasix. He will receive free water boluses.
- The patient has hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia, for which he will continue taking synthroid and at"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU for decreased responsiveness and hypotension, likely due to iatrogenic causes. The patient's respiratory failure is being treated with advanced pressure support ventilation and consideration for extubation. He has been started on prednisone for treatment. The patient's hypertension is being managed with lisinopril and labetalol. An echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension/right ventricular enlargement, and normal ejection fraction. Tropin-T levels are negative. The patient is mildly edematous on his extremities, and diuresis is being continued. His altered mental status has improved, allowing him to follow commands. Sedation is being held, and ventilation is being weaned as needed. The patient also has transient transaminitis, dilutional anemia, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate line management."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU for decreased responsiveness and hypotension, likely caused by iatrogenic factors. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but is expected to wear off soon. His blood gas analysis shows some acidosis, and FiO2 has been increased. He is more responsive now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may deteriorate if he experiences prolonged respiratory failure or if there are complications during weaning from mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The sparse growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the sputum sample indicates a possible infection. The patient may develop pneumonia or another type of infection if proper precautions are not taken.
3. Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure reached 200 mmHg overnight, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. If left untreated, it can lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
4. Cardiac Issues: The echo results show left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. These findings suggest underlying cardiac issues that need to be monitored closely.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to various factors, including medication side effects, hypoxia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, likely due to iatrogenic causes. The patient was intubated and received respiratory support, but has since been extubated and is now alert and interactive.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure, possibly due to iatrogenic causes. However, he has been successfully extubated and is breathing on his own with the assistance of a tracheostomy.

2. Hypertension: The patient had hypertension, which was initially managed with medications such as lisinopril and labetalol. His blood pressure has improved with these treatments.

3. Cardiac Issues: An echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. Tropin T levels were negative on three occasions, indicating no signs of acute myocardial infarction. The patient is undergoing diuresis to manage fluid retention.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved significantly since yesterday, allowing him to follow commands and interact with healthcare providers.

5. Transaminitis: The patient experienced a transient elevation of liver function tests (LFTs) possibly due to transient ischemia caused by hypotension"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-inch old individual with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchitis. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated with oxygen saturation in the high 90s and responsiveness.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 138/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus, and their central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg.

The patient has received various medications including atenolol for hypertension, antibiotics such as vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and piperacillin. The patient is currently on other ICU medications but specific names are not mentioned.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 292 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hb) at 10.5 g/dL, normal potassium (K+) level of 4.5 mEq/L, slightly low sodium (Na+) level of 135 mEq/L, normal chloride (Cl-) level of 97 mEq/L, normal bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 33 mEq/L, low magnesium (Mg++) level of 1.9 mg/dL, normal calcium (Ca++) level of 8.3 mg/dL, and normal albumin level of 2.3 g/dL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 77 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 310, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 98%. The patient's lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L, and their lactic acid level is 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination findings include a heart rate that is on the lower end of the normal range, normal blood pressure, and adequate oxygen saturation. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not evaluated due to technical difficulties.

The patient's assessment and plan include bradycardia with a history of hypertension, electrolyte and fluid disorder with hypomagnesemia, pain control, alteration in nutrition, altered mental status, hypothermia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, chronic respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating an ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, chronic respiratory failure, and acute respiratory failure. These conditions increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening COPD symptoms. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early intervention are necessary.

3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show hypomagnesemia (low magnesium level) and slightly low sodium level. These imbalances can lead to various complications including cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps, and abnormal renal function. Monitoring electrolyte levels and providing appropriate supplementation is crucial.

4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is on the lower end of the normal range, indicating bradycardia. This can potentially lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion. Close monitoring of heart rate and cardiac status is necessary.

5. Pain management: The patient's assessment indicates acute and chronic pain. Proper pain management is essential to improve comfort and prevent complications associated with uncontrolled pain.

6. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration"

- The patient experienced episodes of bradycardia, possibly junctional beats, and had negative fluid balance.
- The patient's blood pressure remains high, and the dose of atenolol was increased.
- The patient's altered mental status has improved, and he is now alert and interactive.
- The patient's cardiac condition shows left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and normal ejection fraction.
- The patient's liver function tests were transiently elevated but have trended down.
- The patient's hematocrit level is falling due to fluid boluses.
- The patient has hypernatremia and will receive free water boluses.
- The patient's thyroid and lipid levels are being managed with medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. There is a potential risk of respiratory failure if the patient's lung function worsens.
2. Infection: Although the patient's sputum sample showed sparse growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci, there is still a possibility of infection"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill man who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He was extubated yesterday and is currently experiencing increased secretions, which require deep suctioning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 138/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His temperature is within normal range at 36.5°C. The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim and has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, piperacillin/tazobactam, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is still extubated but has increased secretions today. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. Hemodynamics: The patient is normotensive, but there is a concern about fluid balance due to a negative fluid balance of 1.3 liters yesterday. The plan is to give 500-1000 cc of fluids today while monitoring blood pressure trends. Imbalances in fluid and electrolytes can lead to complications such as hypotension, pulmonary edema, or renal dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 292 K/uL suggests the presence of an infection. The ongoing need for suctioning and the presence"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, respiratory failure, hypertension, lower extremity edema, altered mental status, transient transaminitis, falling hemoglobin concentration, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's condition has been managed with various interventions including the initiation of atenolol, metoprolol, vancomycin, lasix, trazodone, and diuretics. The patient has also undergone cardiology consult, repeat EKG, and daily chest X-rays.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed episodes of asymptomatic sustained ventricular rhythms on the monitor, which convert spontaneously. This may require further management and rate control.
2. Respiratory Failure: Despite being extubated, the patient may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to worsening lung infiltrates on chest X-ray and previous respiratory infections.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments, indicating a need for continued monitoring and potential additional interventions.
4. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient's echocardiogram demonstrates LVH, RA enlargement,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU due to decreased responsiveness and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications since his admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient developed increased ectopy overnight and subsequently developed AF with rapid ventricular response. He has been prescribed ASA and BB for rate control.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation/infection, but now that he is extubated, he is stable. Vancomycin was started for worsening chest x-ray and sputum culture results.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and he has been prescribed lisinopril and metoprolol to control his hypertension.
4. Cardiac Issues: An echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. The patient's troponin levels were negative, indicating no acute coronary syndrome.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient was previously confused, but is now more alert and interactive after being extubated.
6. Transaminitis: The patient experienced a transient elevation of liver function tests, possibly due to transient ischemia caused by hypotension.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. The patient presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, and was found to be in respiratory failure. He was treated for COPD exacerbation and infection, and is now extubated and stable.

The patient's current conditions include hypertension, cardiac issues with left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. His troponin levels are negative, and he has mild edema in his extremities. He is undergoing continued diuresis with a goal of 1-2 liters net negative today.

The patient also has altered mental status, which has improved significantly since yesterday. He is now alert and interactive after being extubated. He experienced transient elevation of liver function tests possibly due to transient ischemia caused by hypotension, but this trended down.

Other observations include a falling hematocrit from 39.7 to 32.7, which is likely dilutional after receiving fluid boluses. His sodium levels are high at 145, which may be exacerbated by lasix. He has hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia, for which he will continue on synthroid and atorvastatin, respectively.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and monitoring of lines,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They have a history of hypertension and are currently being treated with antihypertensive medications such as atenolol and hydralazine. The patient experienced episodes of ectopy, which evolved into atrial fibrillation with runs of wide complex tachycardia. They were given ASA and statin therapy. The patient's 12-lead EKG showed nonspecific ST-T changes but is now back in normal sinus rhythm. The patient's chest X-ray worsened, prompting the addition of vancomycin to their antibiotic regimen. 

24-hour events include significant changes in heart rhythm, with multiple EKG readings showing varying arrhythmias. The patient's blood pressure has been relatively stable, but there have been fluctuations in heart rate and oxygen saturation levels. Fluid balance has shown an overall deficit of 955 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever (Tmax 37.1°C) and hypothermia (Tcurrent 35.7°C). They have been receiving various medications including hydralazine, metoprolol, and heparin sodium. The patient's labs reveal elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function test results. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab results show elevated lactate levels and an elevated LDH"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They have a history of hypertension and were previously agitated, leading to the administration of atenolol and hydralazine. The patient experienced ectopy that progressed into atrial fibrillation with runs of wide complex tachycardia resembling ventricular tachycardia. There is no chest pain, and the patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm. The patient has been receiving ASA, statin, and cycling enzymes. A 12-lead EKG showed transient ischemic changes similar to the patient's previous presentation but is now back in normal sinus rhythm. The chest X-ray appears worse with more secretions, so vancomycin was added yesterday. The patient has allergies to Bactrim and a rash, and their last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient is on multiple ICU medications, including hydralazine, metoprolol, and heparin sodium. They are also taking ASA, Lipitor, and Lopressor.

24-hour events include EKGs taken at 05:00 AM and 06:15 AM. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F) with a maximum temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate ranging from 53-136 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 71-138/51-138 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1130 mL and output of 1146 mL, with positive balance of -955 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a tracheostomy mask and has an oxygen saturation of 96% on ABG with pH 7.39.

Physical examination reveals the patient sitting up in bed, using their voicebox, with scattered expiratory rales in the chest. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there is no edema in the extremities. Lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 5.8, hematocrit of 33.2, platelet count of 292, creatinine of 0.7, glucose levels ranging from 121-141 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. The assessment and plan include managing wide complex tachycardia and intermittent atrial fibrillation, possibly due to ischemia or an old inferior scar. The patient will continue on beta-blockers and potassium/magnesium repletion. Cardiology consultation is recommended to discuss the role of amiodarone loading. Respiratory distress remains, and the patient's hemodynamics are stable with normotensive blood pressure. The patient requires aggressive fluid resuscitation, and the remaining issues are to be addressed by the housestaff."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have a history of hypertension and are currently experiencing episodes of ectopy, atrial fibrillation, and wide complex tachycardia. The patient's chest X-ray is worsening, and they have been started on vancomycin. The patient is uncomfortable after suctioning, showing signs of respiratory distress despite being extubated. There are concerns about ischemia, especially in the setting of known lung disease and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 138/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.1°C. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased potassium levels, and abnormalities in liver enzymes and kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wide Complex Tachy: The patient's intermittent atrial fibrillation and wide complex tachycardia may be indicative of ischemia, particularly in the context of known lung disease and hypertension. This could potentially lead to further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
2. Respiratory Distress: Despite being extubated, the patient is experiencing increased secretions and signs of respiratory distress. This could progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes hypertension and allergies to Bactrim. The patient was agitated last night and received atenolol and hydralazine. The patient experienced ectopy, which then flipped into atrial fibrillation with runs of wide complex tachycardia. No chest pain was reported, and the patient was given ASA, statin, and cycling enzymes. The patient is currently back in normal sinus rhythm. Cardiology has signed off, but will be calling back. The patient's chest X-ray looked worse, and vancomycin was added.

24-hour events include an EKG at 05:00 AM and another at 06:15 AM. The patient received multiple infusions, including hydralazine, metoprolol, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.1°C to 35.7°C, heart rate between 74 and 136 bpm, blood pressure between 138/51 mmHg and 71/0 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16 and 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,130 mL and output of 2,085 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 955 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheal mask, and their ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and others, which were not documented. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and several other abnormal values. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis is pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient remains critically ill and requires continued ICU care. Nutrition, glycemic control, lines (arterial and central venous catheters), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are all being addressed. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   with diffuse ST changes most notably ST depressions v3-v6. No CP or
   SOB, bp maintained. Cardiology was consulted who recommended starting
   heparin gtt, uptitrating beta blocker, and consulting EP in the AM.
   Trop 0.11. Cardiology called who thought that this is likely demand
   ischemia from previous MI, in the setting of new afib. Patient is chest
   pain free. Patient continued to go into wide-complex rhythm overnight.
   Systolic BPs dropped to 70s at times when this happened.
   - d/c ASA, as patient has ruled out for MI
   - continue metoprolol 50mg pot id. Uptitrate as blood pressure and HR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who has undergone laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presents with decreased responsiveness and hypotension. The note mentions several potential medical complications:

1. Arrhythmia: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (a-fib with RVR), which may be secondary to demand ischemia from a previous myocardial infarction (MI). The cardiology team recommended starting heparin, uptitrating beta-blockers, and consulting an electrophysiology (EP) specialist in the morning.

2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient was extubated and stable, there are concerns about iatrogenic causes of respiratory failure. He has been treated for COPD exacerbation/infection, but his worsening left lung infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to continue vancomycin and Zosyn for this condition.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures were elevated in the morning, reaching the 200s. He was already on lisinopril and atenolol. Hydralazine was given intravenously, and his pressures improved. The medication regimen has been adjusted, switching atenolol to metoprolol.

4. Lower Extremity Edema: An echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy ("

   tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status:  resolving. Per family, patient has
   intermittent episodes of confusion which are different from baseline.
   Neuro exam non focal. Electrolytes within normal limits. Patient does
   have transaminitis, thought to be secondary to prolonged hypotension,
   that is slowly resolving.  TSH within normal limits. Tox screen
   negative.
   - zyprexa PRN insomnia, agitation
   - Consider head CT if concern for continued MS changes
   # Transaminitis:  resolving. Transient elevation of LFT's 3 fold in 4
   hours possibly due to transient ischemia due to hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presents with decreased responsiveness and hypotension. The patient has atrial fibrillation with intermittent wide-complex rhythm, and his blood pressure drops to the 70s during these episodes. Troponin T levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial ischemia. The patient was started on heparin, metoprolol, and an electrophysiology (EP) consult was recommended. 

The patient also has respiratory failure, likely due to iatrogenic causes, and is being treated for COPD exacerbation and infection. He was extubated and is stable, but his sputum sample showed sparse growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Chest X-ray revealed worsening left lung infiltrates. The patient is receiving vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration pneumonia, prednisone for COPD exacerbation, and will have repeat sputum cultures and daily chest X-rays.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with metoprolol and lisinopril, and he is being diuresed with lasix. Lower extremity edema is present, and an echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement with a normal ejection fraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w decreased responsiveness and hypotension.
   # A fib. Pt with increased ectopy overnight, developed a-fib with RVR
   with diffuse ST changes most notably ST depressions v3-v6. No CP or
   SOB, bp maintained. Cardiology was consulted who recommended starting
   heparin gtt, uptitrating beta blocker, and consulting EP in the AM.
   Trop 0.11. Cardiology called who thought that this is likely demand
   ischemia from previous MI, in the setting of new afib. Patient is chest
   pain free. Patient continued to go into wide-complex rhythm overnight.
   Systolic BPs dropped to 70s at times when this happened.
   - d/c ASA, as patient has ruled out for MI
   - continue metoprolol 50mg pot id. Uptitrate as blood pressure and HR
   tolerates
   - aggressively replete lytes
   - EP consult this AM
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely iatrogenic causes although treating for
   COPD exacerbation/infection, now extubated, stable. Sputum sample
   sparse growth of coag + staph. CXR yesterday shows worsening L lung
   infiltrates.
   - Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day 1= [**5-26**]) for aspiration pneumonia
   - Continue Prednisone for COPD exacerbation
   - f/u repeat sputum cx
   - Daily CXR
   - Cont. MDI
   # Hypertension:  Systolic BPs 70s-180s overnight. Currently on
   Metoprolol 50mg po tid, and Lisinopril 10mg po daily. Also diuresing
   patient with lasix 20mg IV. Would not treat further episodes of
   hypertension until dysrhythmia resolves.
   # Lower extremity edema:  Echo demonstrates LVH, RA enlargement,
   moderate pulmonary HTN/RV enlargement with normal EF.  Trops neg. x 3.
   Mildly edematous on extremities.  Patient got 20mg IV lasix x2
   overnight. And is net I/O
s even.
   - Diuresis with goal of 500 cc net negative today as BP and HR
   tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status:  resolving. Per family, patient has
   intermittent episodes of confusion which are different from baseline.
   Neuro exam non focal. Electrolytes within normal limits. Patient does
   have transaminitis, thought to be secondary to prolonged hypotension,
   that is slowly resolving.  TSH within normal limits. Tox screen
   negative.
   - zyprexa PRN insomnia, agitation
   - Consider head CT if concern for continued MS changes
   # Transaminitis:  resolving. Transient elevation of LFT's 3 fold in 4
   hours possibly due to transient ischemia due to hypotension.
continue
   to follow LFTs
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Hct 33.8 this AM, which appears to be his
   baseline. 39.7 on admission, likely from hemoconcentration. Patient not
   actively bleeding. If continues to drop would obtain iron studies, B12,
   folate levels.
   - daily Hcts for now
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved. Na 147 yesterday. This AM, down to 140.
   Patient got 500cc D5W yesterday.
   -continue to monitor as we continue to diurese him, and this will
   likely recur with lasix
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue synthroid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension. The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and diffuse ST changes on ECG, suggestive of ischemia. He received heparin, uptitrated beta-blocker therapy, and an electrophysiology consult was requested. Troponin levels were elevated, but no chest pain or shortness of breath was reported. The patient continues to experience wide-complex rhythms and systolic BPs in the 70s during these episodes. 

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has ongoing wide-complex rhythms, and his systolic BPs drop to the 70s during these episodes. This may indicate ongoing ischemia or arrhythmias.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential inadequate perfusion and organ function.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated for suspected COPD exacerbation/infection, but now has been extubated and is stable. However, worsening lung infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest ongoing respiratory issues, possibly aspiration pneumonia.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which are thought to be secondary to prolonged hypotension.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and intermittent wide-complex rhythms. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension during the wide-complex rhythms. He has a history of COPD exacerbation/infection, for which he is being treated. His chest X-ray shows worsening left lung infiltrates, indicating a possible infection. He is currently on several medications, including heparin, metoprolol, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure and wide-complex rhythms suggest the possibility of cardiac complications. Atrial fibrillation and the associated reduced cardiac output can lead to hypotension and decreased tissue perfusion. The wide-complex rhythms may indicate ventricular arrhythmias, which can compromise cardiac function further.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening left lung infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a possible worsening respiratory status. This, combined with his COPD exacerbation/infection, increases the risk of respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory support with a tracheostomy and supplemental oxygen is crucial to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w decreased responsiveness and hypotension.
   # A fib. Pt with increased ectopy overnight, developed a-fib with RVR
   with diffuse ST changes most notably ST depressions v3-v6. No CP or
   SOB, bp maintained. Cardiology was consulted who recommended starting
   heparin gtt, uptitrating beta blocker, and consulting EP in the AM.
   Trop 0.11. Cardiology called who thought that this is likely demand
   ischemia from previous MI, in the setting of new afib. Patient is chest
   pain free. Patient continued to go into wide-complex rhythm overnight.
   Systolic BPs dropped to 70s at times when this happened.
   - d/c ASA, as patient has ruled out for MI
   - continue metoprolol 50mg pot id. Uptitrate as blood pressure and HR
   tolerates
   - aggressively replete lytes
   - EP consult this AM
   -continue to trend trops
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely iatrogenic causes although treating for
   COPD exacerbation/infection, now extubated, stable. Sputum sample
   sparse growth of coag + staph. CXR yesterday shows worsening L lung
   infiltrates. Sputum culture now growing MSSA.
   - D/c Vanc. Start Nafcillin. Continue Zosyn (day 1= [**5-23**]) for total 7
   day courseaspiration pneumonia
   - reduce prednisone to 40mg po daily for COPD exacerbation. Consider
   tapering to 20mg po daily on [**6-2**]
   - f/u repeat sputum cx
   - Daily CXR
   - Cont. MDI
   # Hypertension:  Systolic BPs 70s-180s overnight. Currently on
   Metoprolol 50mg po tid, and Lisinopril 10mg po daily. Also diuresing
   patient with lasix 20mg IV. Would not treat further episodes of
   hypertension until dysrhythmia resolves.
   # Lower extremity edema:  Echo demonstrates LVH, RA enlargement,
   moderate pulmonary HTN/RV enlargement with normal EF.  Trops neg. x 3.
   Mildly edematous on extremities.  Patient got 20mg IV lasix x2
   overnight. And is net I/O
s even.
   - Cautious diuresis with goal of net even today as BP and HR tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status:  resolving. Per family, patient has
   intermittent episodes of confusion which are different from baseline.
   Neuro exam non focal. Electrolytes within normal limits. Patient does
   have transaminitis, thought to be secondary to prolonged hypotension,
   that is slowly resolving.  TSH within normal limits. Tox screen
   negative.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to intermittent hypotension in the setting
   of dysrhthmia.
   - zyprexa PRN insomnia, agitation
   - Consider head CT if concern for continued MS changes
   # Transaminitis:  resolving. Transient elevation of LFT's 3 fold in 4
   hours possibly due to transient ischemia due to hypotension.
continue
   to follow LFTs
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Hct 33.8 this AM, which appears to be his
   baseline. 39.7 on admission, likely from hemoconcentration. Patient not
   actively bleeding. If continues to drop would obtain iron studies, B12,
   folate levels.
   - daily Hcts for now
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved. Na 147 yesterday. This AM, down to 140.
   Patient got 500cc D5W yesterday.
   -continue to monitor as we continue to diurese him, and this will
   likely recur with lasix

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is altered mental status and hypotension. 

The patient has been experiencing various medical issues since admission. They were initially diagnosed with new-onset atrial fibrillation (afib) and intermittent wide-complex rhythm. Heparin was started for afib, and metoprolol was recommended. An electrophysiology (EP) consult was also ordered.

The patient's troponin level is elevated, indicating possible ischemia from a prior myocardial infarction (MI). They received 20mg IV lasix twice and had a chest X-ray showing a possible infiltrate at the left base. 

The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim DS, which caused a rash. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin on 05/27/2198 at 04:32 PM, followed by Vancomycin on 05/28/2198 at 05:56 AM.

In terms of infusions, the patient is receiving heparin sodium at a rate of 500 units/hour and metoprolol. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) given on 05/28/2198 at 12:30 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted below. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w decreased responsiveness and hypotension.
   # A fib. Pt with increased ectopy overnight, developed a-fib with RVR
   with diffuse ST changes most notably ST depressions v3-v6. No CP or
   SOB, bp maintained. Cardiology was consulted who recommended starting
   heparin gtt, uptitrating beta blocker, and consulting EP in the AM.
   Trop  peaked at 0.11. Cardiology called who thought that this is likely
   demand ischemia from previous MI, in the setting of new afib. Patient
   is chest pain free. Has episodes of wide-complex rhythm associated wth
   hypotension. Systolic BPs dropped to 70s at times when this happened.
   Per EP idioventricular perfusion rhythm from some prior ischemic event,
   may resolve in time, give atropine if persistently hypotensive,
   especially if with anomalous rhythm
   - continue metoprolol 50mg po tid. Uptitrate as blood pressure and HR
   tolerates
   - heparin gtt
   - aggressively replete lytes
   - f/u EP recs
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely iatrogenic causes although treating for
   COPD exacerbation/infection, now extubated, stable. Sputum sample
   sparse growth of coag + staph. Sputum culture now growing MSSA. Repeat
   sputum culture shows no growth.
   - D/c Vanc. Start Nafcillin ([**5-28**]= day 1). Continue Zosyn ([**5-29**] = day
   [**7-31**]) for total 7 day course for aspiration pneumonia
   - reduce prednisone to 40mg po daily for COPD exacerbation. Consider
   tapering to 20mg po daily on [**6-2**]
   - Daily CXR
   - Cont. MDI
   # Hypertension/hypotension: Has had episodes of both hypertension and
   hypotension. Hypotension is transient and associated with patients
   idioventricular rhythm. One episode of hypotension overnight while in
   NSR, given 500 cc bolus with good response.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50mg po tid and Lisinopril 10mg po daily.
   - Cautious diuresis with lasix 20mg IV prn if appears fluid overloaded
   - IVF bolus prn
   - Atropine if persistently hypotensive and in anomalous rhythm
   # Lower extremity edema:  Echo demonstrates LVH, RA enlargement,
   moderate pulmonary HTN/RV enlargement with normal EF.  Trops neg. x 3.
   Mildly edematous on extremities.  Patient was 1.2 L net negative
   overnight.
   - Cautious diuresis with goal of net even today as BP and HR tolerate.
   # Altered Mental Status:  resolving. Per family, patient has
   intermittent episodes of confusion which are different from baseline.
   Neuro exam non focal. Electrolytes within normal limits. Patient does
   have transaminitis, thought to be secondary to prolonged hypotension,
   that is slowly resolving.  TSH within normal limits. Tox screen
   negative.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to intermittent hypotension in the setting
   of dysrhthmia.
   - zyprexa PRN insomnia, agitation
   - Consider head CT if concern for continued MS changes
   # Transaminitis:  resolving. Transient elevation of LFT's 3 fold in 4
   hours possibly due to transient ischemia due to hypotension.
 LFTs
   trended down.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Hct 31.3 from 33.8 this AM, which appears to be
   his baseline. 39.7 on admission, likely from hemoconcentration. No
   signs of active bleeding. If continues to trend down will consider iron
   studies, B12, folate.
   - daily Hcts for now
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved. Peaked at 147, resolved c/ 500 cc D5W. This

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presents with decreased responsiveness and hypotension. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and diffuse ST changes on EKG. Cardiology recommends starting heparin, uptitrating beta-blocker, and consulting electrophysiology in the morning. Troponin peaked at 0.11. The patient experiences wide-complex rhythm associated with hypotension, which is likely demand ischemia from a previous myocardial infarction. An idioventricular perfusion rhythm is noted, which may resolve over time, and atropine should be given if persistently hypotensive, especially with anomalous rhythm.

The patient's respiratory status is stable after being extubated for treating COPD exacerbation/infection. Sputum culture shows growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), so nafcillin has been started, and zosyn will be continued for a total of 7-day course for aspiration pneumonia.

The patient also has episodes of hypertension and hypotension, with hypotension associated with idioventricular rhythm. He is being closely monitored with cautious diuresis and IVF bolus as needed. Metoprolol and lisinopril are continued for hypertension/hypotension management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of persistent hypotension and altered mental status. He has a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sepsis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 138/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus, but he had an episode of idioventricular rhythm earlier. He is receiving heparin sodium infusion, as well as various medications for pain control, nutrition, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and increased levels of lactate and troponin T. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low magnesium. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.39. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 1,189 mL since 12 AM, and he has received a total of 1,716 mL of fluids since then.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pain control. He presented with altered mental status, hypothermia, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to his underlying COPD and acute exacerbation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Proper management of infection sources, administration of antibiotics, and hemodynamic support are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypomagnesemia (low magnesium). Correction of these imbalances is necessary to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Delirium or Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to multiple factors including sepsis, hypoxia, or medications. Continuous monitoring and appropriate interventions are required to prevent worsening of mental status.
6. Pain Management: The patient has a history of chronic pain, and acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unchanged review of systems from admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 129/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient is receiving various ICU medications and has been weaned off heparin and zosyn. The patient's critical care trending is showing improvement, with a current value of 27.9%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, nafcillin) indicating a possible infection. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay. Prophylaxis should be considered to prevent this complication.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, which have since resolved. The patient now complains of loose bowel movements for the past two days, which are brown in color. There are no new episodes of atrial fibrillation after reviewing the telecardiology results. The patient's troponin levels are trending down. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diarrhea: The patient's complaint of loose bowel movements may indicate an infection or gastrointestinal issue. It is important to obtain C. difficile toxin to rule out this possibility.
2. Dysrhythmias: Although the patient did not have any new episodes of atrial fibrillation, there is still a risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. Continuing beta blockers and monitoring the patient's heart rhythm is recommended.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 31 to 27. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, including checking for occult blood loss and sending stool samples for guaiac testing.
4. Hypertension/Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of both high and low blood pressure. Transient hypotension is associated with the patient's idioventricular rhythm. Close monitoring and appropriate medication adjustments are necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, and was found to have dysrhythmias. His Troponin-T levels are trending down. He has been extubated and is stable, with sparse growth of coag + staph in his sputum sample. The sputum culture is growing MSSA, so nafcillin has been started. He is also receiving prednisone for COPD exacerbation and metoprolol for hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dysrhythmias: The patient is experiencing dysrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac complications if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient has been extubated and is stable, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to potential iatrogenic causes or underlying COPD exacerbation/infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology and appropriate treatment.
4. Hypertension/Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of both hypertension and hypotension. Proper management of blood pressure is crucial to prevent complications.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient previously had signs of fluid overload, but these have resolved. Continued monitoring is necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, and was found to have dysrhythmias. His TropT levels are trending down. The patient was extubated and is now stable. He has been treated for a possible COPD exacerbation/infection, but sputum cultures showed no growth. He completed a 7-day course of Zosyn and was started on Nafcillin. Prednisone was initiated at 40mg daily for his COPD exacerbation and may be tapered to 20mg on [**6-2**]. He continues to have episodes of both hypertension and hypotension, which are being managed with medication adjustments. His fluid overload has resolved, and he is being monitored for altered mental status, resolving transaminitis, resolved hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with decreased responsiveness and hypotension, which are now resolving. The patient is experiencing diarrhea, dysrhythmias, respiratory failure, anemia, altered mental status, transaminitis, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diarrhea: The patient is complaining of loose stools for two days, which could be due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. However, C. diff toxin testing was negative.
2. Dysrhythmias: The patient has been experiencing irregular heart rhythms, and the decision was made to stop heparin and continue beta-blocker therapy.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing iatrogenic respiratory failure, possibly due to the treatment for COPD exacerbation and infection with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the sputum. Antibiotic therapy with Nafcillin and prednisone has been initiated.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable at 27% from 31%. Possible causes include occult blood loss, which will be investigated further with stool testing for occult blood.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient appears to be at baseline today, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy with permanent tracheostomy. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing decreased responsiveness, hypotension, resolving dysrhythmias, and transient hypotension. The patient has also been complaining of loose bowel movements for the past two days, which are brown in color. His vital signs are stable, and he is on various medications including metoprolol, Nafcillin, and Dicloxacillin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for COPD exacerbation and MSSA in sputum. There is a likelihood of iatrogenic respiratory failure due to the treatment.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is stable but decreased from 31 to 27. It is unclear etiology, and there may be occult blood loss. Stool for guaiac will be sent to investigate further.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient appears at baseline today, but his altered mental status needs continuous monitoring.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's LFTs are resolving after being elevated previously.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are now resolved, but it needs to be monitored.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient is already on Synthroid for hypothyroidism, and it should"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of chronic conditions including hypertension, alteration in nutrition, hypothermia, sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications. The patient's family is resistant to leaving the hospital until a specific doctor is available. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding potential complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can be a serious and life-threatening condition. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters will be necessary to detect any signs of infection or worsening sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic and acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory effort will be required. Intensive care interventions such as mechanical ventilation may be needed if the patient's respiratory function deteriorates.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within the normal range, but there is a history of hypotension. Frequent assessment of blood pressure and hemodynamic stability is crucial to prevent hypotensive episodes.

4. Delirium: Elderly patients in the ICU often experience delirium. Regular assessments of mental status and cognitive function should be performed to identify any changes or signs of"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock.
   # Shock:  Unclear whether refractory hypotension is a component of
   cardiac failure or sepsis.  Physical exam demonstrates cool motted
   extremities, initial EKG demonstrates some degree of an acute cardiac
   event with elevated troponins.  Patient refractory to boluses, so
   possibly cardiogenic shock.  However, increased cardiac output, and
   mottling likely due to continued pressor use.  WBC count increased, and
   patient refractory to fluid boluses (8L), could also be a picture of
   septic shock, though not febrile and source unclear (could be previous
   [**Name (NI) 1684**] growing from sputum culture, but unlikely).  Cardiology did not
   wish to do a bedside echo, possible cath today if pt. agrees.  Mixed
   venous O2 sat at 97%, peripheral tissues may not be extracting oxygen,
   possibly consider switching a pressor.
   - Cardiology cath possibly
   - Echo
   - Continue pressors for MAP > 65
   - Cont. IV fluid boluses PRN for MAP > 65
   - Cardiology c/s
   - D/C metoprolol 25mg TID
   - ASA, statin
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient possibly in ARDS, fluid overloaded on
   exam, possibly also cardiac source, PEEP at 14 currently.  Saturation
   transiently moving down to 87%.  FiO2 at 100%, possibility of ARDS
   fairly likely if continues at this level.  Pt. still having wheezes as
   well, unclear what inciting incident was to cause respiratory drop to
   mid 70
s, possibly cardiac in origin, suctioning did not reveal
   anything.  Most recent gas demonstrates resp. acidosis with pO2 in the
   mid 200
   - PEEP at 14cm, cont. to increase and decrease FiO2 as possible while
   maintaining PO2 above 80
   - Retaining Co2, though auto PEEPing currently, would decrease RR to
   make breathing more synchronous with the machine and then give 3 amps
   of bicarbonate for ensuing resp. acidosis.
   - Cont. sedation
   # Anemia:  Hct stable yesterday.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Pt. sedated and intubated, unable to assess
   at the moment.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Will monitor again given patient
s hypotension, and
   previous transaminitis in the setting of hypotension
 LFTs trended down.
    .
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved
   - continue to monitor
   - D5W as needed
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue atorvastatin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating possible infection. He is currently intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's refractory hypotension, elevated troponins, and initial EKG findings suggest an acute cardiac event. The patient may be experiencing cardiogenic shock due to a possible cardiac failure.
2. Septic shock: The increased WBC count and refractory response to fluid boluses raise the possibility of septic shock. However, the source of infection is unclear, and the patient does not have a fever.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there are concerns about the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His saturation transiently moved down to 87%, and recent gases show respiratory acidosis.
4. Transaminitis: The patient had elevated liver enzymes in the past, which improved but may worsen due to his current hypotension and other medical conditions.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had high sodium levels, but it has resolved. Close monitoring is needed to prevent its recurrence.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock.
   # Shock:  Unclear whether refractory hypotension is a component of
   cardiac failure or sepsis.  Physical exam demonstrates cool motted
   extremities, initial EKG demonstrates some degree of an acute cardiac
   event with troponins.  Patient refractory to boluses, so possibly
   cardiogenic shock.  However, increased cardiac output, and mottling
   likely due to continued pressor use.  WBC count increased, and patient
   refractory to fluid boluses (8L), could also be a picture of septic
   shock, though not febrile and source unclear (could be previous [**Name (NI) 1684**]
   growing from sputum culture, but unlikely).  Cardiology did not wish to
   do a bedside echo, possible cath today if pt. agrees.  Mixed venous O2
   sat at 97%, peripheral tissues may not be extracting oxygen, possibly
   consider switching a pressor.
   - Cardiology cath possibly
   - Echo
   - Continue pressors for MAP > 65
   - Cont. IV fluid boluses PRN for MAP > 65
   - Cardiology c/s
   - D/C metoprolol 25mg TID
   - ASA, statin
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient possibly in ARDS, fluid overloaded on
   exam, possibly also cardiac source, PEEP at 14 currently.  Saturation
   transiently moving down to 87%.  FiO2 at 100%, possibility of ARDS
   fairly likely if continues at this level.  Pt. still having wheezes as
   well, unclear what inciting incident was to cause respiratory drop to
   mid 70
s, possibly cardiac in origin, suctioning did not reveal
   anything.  Most recent gas demonstrates resp. acidosis with pO2 in the
   mid 200
   - PEEP at 14cm, cont. to increase and decrease FiO2 as possible while
   maintaining PO2 above 80
   - Retaining Co2, could increase his respiratory rate
   - Cont. sedation
   # Anemia:  Hct stable yesterday.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Pt. sedated and intubated, unable to assess
   at the moment.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Will monitor again given patient
s hypotension, and
   previous transaminitis in the setting of hypotension
 LFTs trended down.

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak, suggesting an acute cardiac event. The patient also has elevated white blood cell count and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's condition is uncertain between cardiac failure or sepsis. Physical examination shows cool mottled extremities, initial EKG demonstrates some degree of an acute cardiac event with troponins, and the patient is refractory to boluses, possibly cardiogenic shock. However, the increased cardiac output and mottling may be due to continued pressor use. The patient's WBC count is elevated, and he is refractory to fluid boluses, which could also be a picture of septic shock.

The medical team is considering a possible cardiac catheterization and echo, continuing pressors for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65, and continuing IV fluid boluses as needed for a MAP > 65. They also want to discontinue metoprolol, start ASA and statin, and consult cardiology.

The patient may be in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to fluid overload and possibly a cardiac source. His saturation has transiently moved down to 87%, and FiO2 is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and his condition suggests possible cardiogenic or septic shock. He has been receiving various treatments including heparin, aspirin, statins, and prepped with n-acetylcysteine for a possible cardiac catheterization.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's refractory hypotension could be due to cardiogenic or septic shock. Physical examination shows cool mottled extremities, and initial EKG demonstrates an acute cardiac event with troponin elevation. The patient's increased cardiac output and mottling suggest continued pressor use. The elevated WBC count and lack of response to fluid boluses raise the possibility of septic shock, although the source is unclear.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is possibly in ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), as evidenced by transiently low saturation levels, wheezing, and respiratory acidosis. The PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) has been adjusted to maintain oxygenation above 80.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is sedated and intubated, making it difficult to assess his mental status accurately"

   Echo
   The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. The left ventricular
   cavity is very small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline
   normal free wall function. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad. There are no echocardiographic
   signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-5-23**], the pulmonary artery pressure is further increased.

   IMPRESSION: severe pulmonary hypertension; dilated right ventricle;
   small, hyperdynamic left ventricle
   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock.
   # Shock:  Patient with shock of unclear etiology. Requiring multiple
   fluid boluses (11 over 24 hours) to maintain blood pressures as well as
   levophed and dopamine.  Unclear whether refractory hypotension is a
   component of cardiac failure or sepsis. Patient had sudden of shock,
   initial EKG demonstrated some degree of an acute cardiac event,
   resolved on subsequent EKGs. Troponin peaked at 0.27, trended down to
   0.11 now trending, 0.15 this am. Echo is not consistent with
   cardiogenic shock, cardiology following.  Also considering septic shock
   given leukocytosis, however afebrile, lactate 1.3 and no obvious
   source, leukocytosis could be consistent with steroids, stress
   response. On vancomycin and zosyn. Also considering adrenal
   insufficiency given patient
s treatment with steroids although other
   labs not consistent with this etiology. Given stress dose steroids last
   night. Random cortisol level 21.9.
   -?  Cardiology cath possibly
   - Continue vanco/zosyn
   - F/u cultures (negative to date)
   - Continue pressors for MAP > 65
   - Cont. IV fluid boluses PRN for MAP > 65
   - Holding metoprolol 25mg TID
   - ASA, statin
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with hypoxia with initial event. Patient
   possibly in ARDS, fluid overloaded on exam, possibly also cardiac
   source, PEEP at 14 currently.  FiO2 now at 70%. RR increased to 22
   overnight for hypercarbia. Last ABG 7.34/56/116.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - Will monitor closely for autopeeping, patient autopeeping yesterday,
   RR decreased, however increased o/n given CO2.
   - Cont. sedation
   # Anemia:  Hct stable yesterday.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Pt. sedated and intubated.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Will monitor again given patient
s hypotension, and
   previous transaminitis in the setting of hypotension
 LFTs trended down.
    .

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak, indicating a possible cardiac event. The patient also has severe pulmonary hypertension, dilated right ventricle, and small, hyperdynamic left ventricle according to the transthoracic echo.

The patient is in shock of unclear etiology, requiring multiple fluid boluses to maintain blood pressures. The initial EKG demonstrated an acute cardiac event, but it resolved on subsequent EKGs. Troponin levels are trending down, indicating improvement in cardiac injury.

The patient's leukocytosis could be consistent with steroids, stress response, or septic shock, as there is no obvious source of infection. However, the patient is afebrile, and lactate levels are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with hypoxia and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 14 and FiO2 at 70%. The RR has been increased to 22 overnight for hypercarbia.

Other issues include anemia, altered mental status due to sedation and intubation, transaminitis, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's nutritional"

   Echo
   The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. The left ventricular
   cavity is very small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline
   normal free wall function. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad. There are no echocardiographic
   signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-5-23**], the pulmonary artery pressure is further increased.
   IMPRESSION: severe pulmonary hypertension; dilated right ventricle;
   small, hyperdynamic left ventricle
   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock.
   # Shock:  Patient with shock of unclear etiology. Requiring multiple
   fluid boluses (11 over 24 hours) to maintain blood pressures as well as
   levophed and dopamine.  Unclear whether refractory hypotension is a
   component of cardiac failure or sepsis. Patient had sudden of shock,
   initial EKG demonstrated some degree of an acute cardiac event,
   resolved on subsequent EKGs. Troponin peaked at 0.27, trended down to
   0.11 now trending, 0.15 this am. Echo is not consistent with
   cardiogenic shock, cardiology following. Concern for PE, currently on
   heparin gtt, CTA deferred yesterday as too unstable to go to CT
   scanner. Also considering septic shock given leukocytosis, however
   afebrile, lactate 1.3 and no obvious source, leukocytosis could be
   consistent with steroids, stress response. On vancomycin and zosyn.
   Also considering adrenal insufficiency given patient
s treatment with
   steroids although other labs not consistent with this etiology. Given
   stress dose steroids last night. Random cortisol level 21.9.

   - ASA, statin
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with hypoxia with initial event. Patient
   possibly in ARDS, fluid overloaded on exam, possibly also cardiac
   source, PEEP at 14 currently.  FiO2 now at 60%. RR increased to 22
   overnight for hypercarbia. Last ABG 7.34/56/116.
   - Wean PEEP,  FiO2 as tolerated
   - Will monitor closely for autopeeping, patient autopeeping yesterday,
   RR decreased, however increased o/n given CO2.
   - Cont. sedation

   Echo
   The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. The left ventricular
   cavity is very small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline
   normal free wall function. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad. There are no echocardiographic
   signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-5-23**], the pulmonary artery pressure is further increased.
   IMPRESSION: severe pulmonary hypertension; dilated right ventricle;
   small, hyperdynamic left ventricle
   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock.
   # Shock:  Patient with shock of unclear etiology. Requiring multiple
   fluid boluses (11 over 24 hours) to maintain blood pressures as well as
   levophed and dopamine.  Unclear whether refractory hypotension is a
   component of cardiac failure or sepsis. Patient had sudden of shock,
   initial EKG demonstrated some degree of an acute cardiac event,
   resolved on subsequent EKGs. Troponin peaked at 0.27, trended down to
   0.11 now trending, 0.15 this am. Echo is not consistent with
   cardiogenic shock, cardiology following.  Also considering septic shock
   given leukocytosis, however afebrile, lactate 1.3 and no obvious
   source, leukocytosis could be consistent with steroids, stress
   response. On vancomycin and zosyn. Also considering adrenal
   insufficiency given patient
s treatment with steroids although other
   labs not consistent with this etiology. Given stress dose steroids last
   night. Random cortisol level 21.9.
   -?  Cardiology cath possibly
   - Continue vanco/zosyn

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. His WBC count is elevated, indicating possible cardiogenic or septic shock. He requires multiple fluid boluses to maintain blood pressures and is on levophed and dopamine. The initial EKG showed an acute cardiac event, but subsequent EKGs did not show any abnormalities. Troponin levels are decreasing. An echocardiogram reveals severe pulmonary hypertension, dilated right ventricle, and small, hyperdynamic left ventricle. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure with hypoxia and possibly in ARDS. He has altered mental status due to sedation and intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's symptoms of sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak suggest a possible acute cardiac event. The echocardiogram shows a small, hyperdynamic left ventricle, which could be indicative of cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic shock: The elevated WBC count and the use of antibiotics indicate a possible infection leading to septic shock. The patient's hypotension and requirement of multiple fluid boluses also suggest septic shock.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and requires mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The patient is also on high levels of pressors to maintain hemodynamics. The etiology of the patient's condition remains unclear, with potential causes including cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism (PE), or sepsis.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypothermia, possible PE, sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, renal issues (oliguric), hypotension, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/52 mmHg to 114/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.1°C.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values such as electrolytes, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, soft and distended abdomen, cool extremities, and unresponsive neurologic status"

SHOCK
   Etiology remains unclear.  Cardiogenic (though no change in echo in
   terms of new WMA or change in EF, mixed venous sat and lactate not
   suggestive) vs. septic (fever, wbc up though on steroids, mixed venous
   sat consistent) vs. PE/distributive (fluid dependency/responsiveness

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. The patient's condition is consistent with cardiogenic or septic shock, with an unclear etiology. He remains critically ill, requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure and high levels of pressors to maintain hemodynamics.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to increased dependence on mechanical ventilation or the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Myocardial infarction: The presence of ST elevation on the EKG and elevated troponin levels indicate an acute myocardial infarction. There is a possibility of progression or additional myocardial damage if the underlying cause of the infarction is not addressed.

3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, possible fever, and hypothermia suggest an ongoing infection. Sepsis can lead to multiorgan dysfunction and potentially worsen the patient's overall condition if not appropriately managed.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's immobility and critical illness, there is an increased risk of developing"

   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock.
   # Shock:  Patient with fewer episodes of hypotension yesterday.
   Dopamine now weaned off, levophed at 0.1 mcg.  Unclear whether initial
   refractory hypotension was a component of cardiac failure or sepsis.
   Patient had sudden of shock, initial EKG demonstrated some degree of an
   acute cardiac event, resolved on subsequent EKGs. Troponin peaked at
   0.27, trended down to 0.11. Echo is not consistent with cardiogenic
   shock, cardiology following. Concern for PE, currently on heparin gtt,
   CTA being considered.  No clot on B/L UE U/S. Also considering septic
   shock given leukocytosis, however afebrile, lactate 1.3 and no obvious
   source, leukocytosis could be consistent with steroids, stress

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak, suggesting a possible cardiac or septic shock. The patient's condition improved with dopamine weaning off and levophed at 0.1 mcg. However, there are concerns about a pulmonary embolism (PE), and the patient is on heparin. Other potential complications include respiratory failure, anemia, altered mental status, transaminitis, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac or septic shock: The patient initially presented with refractory hypotension and ST elevation on EKG, indicating a possible cardiac event or sepsis. These conditions can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may require immediate intervention.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's sudden unresponsiveness and troponin leak raise concerns for a possible PE. Heparin has been started, and a CT angiography (CTA) is being considered to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, now with possible blood loss
   anemia.
   # Anemia:  Hct at 22, possible RP bleed given flank ecchymosis. Trace
   guaiac + stools.  Giving 2 units today.
   - f/u crits
   - CT Abd/Pelvis, CT head, and CTA chest to rule out RP bleed, head
   bleed, and PE.
   - transfuse crit < 25
   - PPI
   - Discontinue heparin gtt
   .
   # Shock:  Patient with fewer episodes of hypotension yesterday.
   Dopamine now weaned off, levophed at 0.1 mcg.  Unclear whether initial
   refractory hypotension was a component of cardiac failure or sepsis.
   Patient had sudden of shock, initial EKG demonstrated some degree of an
   acute cardiac event, resolved on subsequent EKGs. Troponin peaked at
   0.27, trended down to 0.11. Echo is not consistent with cardiogenic
   shock, cardiology following. Concern for PE, currently on heparin gtt,
   CTA being considered.  No clot on B/L UE U/S. Also considering septic
   shock given leukocytosis, however afebrile, lactate 1.3 and no obvious
   source, leukocytosis could be consistent with steroids, stress
   response.  Currently at 22.1.  On vancomycin and zosyn. Also
   considering adrenal insufficiency given patient
s treatment with
   steroids although other labs not consistent with this etiology. On
   stress dose steroids.
   - Decrease steroids
   - Trend CE
   - F/u cardiology recs
   - Continue vanco/zosyn
   - F/u cultures (negative to date)
   - Continue pressors for MAP > 65
   - Cont. IV fluid boluses PRN for MAP > 65
   - Holding metoprolol 25mg TID
   - ASA, statin
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with hypoxia with initial event. Patient
   possibly in ARDS, fluid overloaded on exam, possibly also cardiac
   source, PEEP at 10 currently.  FiO2 now at 80%. RR at 22 for initial
   hypercarbia. Last ABG7.45/39/92.
   - Wean PEEP,  FiO2 as tolerated
   - Will monitor closely for autopeeping
   - Cont. sedation
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Head CT after episode of unresponsiveness on
   [**5-31**] demonstrating acute changes. Pt intubated. Sedation off since
   midnight without improvement in mental status.
   -  If pt stable to go to CT scanner will repeat head CT
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Will monitor again given patient
s hypotension, and
   previous transaminitis in the setting of hypotension
 LFTs trending down.
    .
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved
   - continue to monitor
   - D5W as needed
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue synthroid
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses PRN, NPO, replete lytes PRN

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy.
- The patient suddenly became unresponsive and had refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak, indicating a possible cardiac event or septic shock.
- The patient's WBC count is elevated, suggesting an infection or inflammatory response.
- The patient has a low hemoglobin level (Hct at 22), which may be due to blood loss anemia, possibly from a ruptured peptic ulcer given the presence of flank ecchymosis and trace guaiac positive stools.
- The patient is receiving critical care and has been diagnosed with cardiogenic or septic shock, respiratory failure (possibly ARDS), altered mental status, transaminitis, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 94 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 157/48 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.
- The patient's lab results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, platelets"

The patient's condition remains critical with ongoing respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, impaired aerobic capacity, impaired balance, and impaired transfers. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, alteration in nutrition, hypothermia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is still compromised, indicating the need for continued ventilatory support and monitoring for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further deterioration in gas exchange.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute myocardial infarction (AMI) requires close monitoring for potential cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or ischemic events. Given the patient's history of hypertension and COPD, these conditions can further exacerbate cardiac stress.
3. Sepsis-related complications: Despite previous interventions, the patient remains at risk for sepsis-related complications due to the ongoing infection and systemic inflammatory response. Close monitoring for signs of septic shock or organ dysfunction is crucial.
4. Impaired mobility and immobility-related complications: The patient's impaired balance and transfers increase the risk of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism ("

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer status post laryngectomy and permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak, which suggests a possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The etiology of the shock remains unclear, with possibilities including cardiogenic, septic, or pulmonary embolism. Pressors have been weaned off, and the patient's hemodynamics have improved. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated pending culture data.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, but there is no evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). An acute myocardial infarction is suspected based on EKG changes, but the echocardiogram did not show any significant changes in ejection fraction or new wall motion abnormalities.

A new left flank ecchymosis has been identified, which raises concerns for bleeding, especially given the low hematocrit level. Heparin has been held, and a CT abdomen has been ordered to assess for any bleeding.

The patient's mental status is described as not responsive, and a head CT has been ordered to rule out bleeding or other etiologies, particularly given the T-wave changes on the EKG.

There is also a question of possible pulmonary embolism due to the timing of decompensation with a line pull, although bilateral upper extremity ultrasound did not"

   Assessment and Plan
 85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, now with possible blood loss
   anemia.
   # Anemia:  Hct at 22  yesterday, ?  bleeding into L flank, back SQ
   tissue given ecchymosis, CT abd showed free fluid but thought not to be
   blood. Trace guaiac + stools.  Heparin gtt d/c
d. Responded
   appropriately to 4 units pRBCs with crit increased to 32.6.
   - tid crits
   - transfuse crit < 25
   - PPI
   - Hold heparin gtt
   - hemolysis labs
   .
   # Shock:  Patient with hypotension after unresponsive event.  Unclear
   whether initial refractory hypotension was a component of cardiac
   failure or sepsis. Patient had sudden of shock, initial EKG
   demonstrated some degree of an acute cardiac event, resolved on
   subsequent EKGs. Troponin peaked at 0.27, trended down to 0.11. Echo is
   not consistent with cardiogenic shock, cardiology following. Concern
   for PE, initially on heparin gtt, CTA [**6-3**] showed no PE, heparin gtt
   now d/c
d. Also considered septic shock given leukocytosis, however
   afebrile, lactates wnl and no obvious source, leukocytosis could be
   consistent with steroids, stress response, now trended down to 11.3. On
   vancomycin and zosyn. Also considered adrenal insufficiency given
   patient
s treatment with steroids although other labs not consistent
   with this etiology. Pressors now off and episodes of hypertension
   yesterday.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn x 7 days
   - F/u cultures (negative to date)
   - Maintain MAP > 65
   - ASA, statin
   - Continue steroids
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive to the 180's,significantly fluid
   overloaded and I/Os LOS 25 liters positive. Overnight was given PO
   metoprolol, IV labetalol 10 mg, and IV hydralazine. Was previously on
   metoprolol 25 mg tid, but had been held in setting of hypotension.  Now
   on 200 mg labetolol [**Hospital1 **].
   - Continue labetolol
   - Diuresis with lasix, goal 1 L net negative
   - Continue to monitor BPs.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with hypoxia with initial event. Likely
   now fluid overloaded in setting of 25 L positive LOS. Also consider
   pneumonia, ARDS, or possible cardiac etiology.  Desaturated to 90's
   with PO2 of 54 overnight, PEEP increased from 10 to 15, FiO2 to 100%
   given lasix 20mg IV x 1. Last ABG 7.47/41/63.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix for diuresis goal of 1 L net negative today
   - Continue abx as above
   - Will monitor closely for autopeeping
   - Cont. sedation
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Head CT after episode of unresponsiveness on
   [**5-31**] demonstrating acute changes. Pt intubated.
   - Repeat head CT shows no acute intracranial process.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Will monitor again given patient
s hypotension, and
   previous transaminitis in the setting of hypotension and abdomen/flank
   ecchymosis.
 Recheck LFTs, lipase
    .
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved. 137 today.
   - continue to monitor sodium.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer, who underwent laryngectomy with permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, troponin leak, elevated WBC, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with anemia due to bleeding into the left flank, back SQ tissue, and free fluid in the abdomen but not blood. He has also been diagnosed with shock, possibly cardiogenic or septic in origin. The patient's hypertension is being managed with antihypertensive medications. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to fluid overload, pneumonia, ARDS, or a cardiac etiology. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to hypoxia and possible hypotension. He has been diagnosed with transaminitis, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding into the left flank and back SQ tissue, indicating a risk of ongoing hemorrhage.
2. Shock: The patient has been diagnosed with shock, which could be cardiogenic or septic in origin. This increases the risk of organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient has refractory hypotension, which can lead"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus. He presented to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon admission, the patient was found to have an elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. 

Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial injury, as well as elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, suggesting an inflammatory response. The patient's blood glucose level was also elevated. Imaging studies showed evidence of free fluid in the abdomen but not blood, and bilateral renal cysts. 

The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, with further laboratory abnormalities including acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels. He developed hypotension and required aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. 

The patient's respiratory status worsened, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Despite these interventions, the patient continued to experience hypoxemia and hypercapnia. 

A CT scan of the head was negative for any intracranial pressure. A CT pulmonary angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism. 

The patient's allergy history includes a rash with Bactrim DS. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antacids, and vasopressors. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, troponin leak, elevated WBC count, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient also has a possible blood loss anemia indicated by flank ecchymosis and trace guaiac positive stools. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells with a critical hemoglobin level of 23, but his CT abdomen/pelvis showed free fluid in the abdomen, which was initially thought to be blood, possibly due to a bladder perforation. However, a CT cystogram showed no extravasation from the bladder. The patient's condition has been complex and dynamic, with multiple potential medical complications arising.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate possible blood loss anemia, which could be due to the reported flank ecchymosis and suspected retroperitoneal bleed.
2. Shock: The patient experienced hypotension after an unresponsive event, which may be cardiogenic or septic in origin. Initial EKG demonstrated an acute cardiac event, but subsequent EKGs did not show any abnormalities. Troponin levels peaked at 0.27 and trended down to 0.11, suggesting a resolved cardiac event.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, troponin leak, elevated WBC count, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient also had flank ecchymosis, which raised concerns for a possible retroperitoneal bleed. 

Initial laboratory results showed anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) of 22, and there was a suspicion of a possible RP bleed. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with a critical drop to 23, and then another 2 units were given with a subsequent increase in hematocrit to 32.6. A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity, but it was not confirmed to be blood. A CT cystogram also showed no extravasation from the bladder. 

The patient experienced episodes of hypertension, and he was started on metoprolol and then labetalol to manage his blood pressure. His respiratory status deteriorated, leading to hypoxia, and his PEEP was increased from 10 to 15, and FiO2 was increased to 100%. 

The patient's altered mental status was initially concerning for an intracranial process, but subsequent head CT"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, now with possible blood loss
   anemia.
   # Anemia:  Hct at 22  yesterday, ?  bleeding into L flank, back SQ
   tissue given ecchymosis, CT abd showed free fluid but thought not to be
   blood. Trace guaiac + stools.  Heparin gtt d/c
d. Responded
   appropriately to 4 units pRBCs with crit increased to 32.6.
   - tid crits
   - transfuse crit < 25
   - PPI
   - Hold heparin gtt
   - hemolysis labs
   .
   # Shock:  Patient with hypotension after unresponsive event.  Unclear
   whether initial refractory hypotension was a component of cardiac
   failure or sepsis. Patient had sudden of shock, initial EKG
   demonstrated some degree of an acute cardiac event, resolved on
   subsequent EKGs. Troponin peaked at 0.27, trended down to 0.11. Echo is
   not consistent with cardiogenic shock, cardiology following. Concern
   for PE, initially on heparin gtt, CTA [**6-3**] showed no PE, heparin gtt
   now d/c
d. Also considered septic shock given leukocytosis, however
   afebrile, lactates wnl and no obvious source, leukocytosis could be
   consistent with steroids, stress response, now trended down to 11.3. On
   vancomycin and zosyn. Also considered adrenal insufficiency given
   patient
s treatment with steroids although other labs not consistent
   with this etiology. Pressors now off and episodes of hypertension
   yesterday.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn x 7 days
   - F/u cultures (negative to date)
   - Maintain MAP > 65
   - ASA, statin
   - Continue steroids
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive to the 180's,significantly fluid
   overloaded and I/Os LOS 25 liters positive. Overnight was given PO
   metoprolol, IV labetalol 10 mg, and IV hydralazine. Was previously on
   metoprolol 25 mg tid, but had been held in setting of hypotension.  Now
   on 200 mg labetolol [**Hospital1 **].
   - Continue labetolol
   - Diuresis with lasix, goal 1 L net negative
   - Continue to monitor BPs.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with hypoxia with initial event. Likely
   now fluid overloaded in setting of 25 L positive LOS. Also consider
   pneumonia, ARDS, or possible cardiac etiology.  Desaturated to 90's
   with PO2 of 54 overnight, PEEP increased from 10 to 15, FiO2 to 100%
   given lasix 20mg IV x 1. Last ABG 7.47/41/63.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix for diuresis goal of 1 L net negative today
   - Continue abx as above
   - Will monitor closely for autopeeping
   - Cont. sedation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, and ST elevation on EKG, along with elevated WBC count, indicating possible cardiogenic or septic shock. He also has signs of blood loss anemia, with a Hct of 22 yesterday and evidence of bleeding in the left flank and back. He responded appropriately to 4 units of packed red blood cells and increased his critical threshold to 32.6.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Shock: Hypotension after an unresponsive event, with initial EKG showing some degree of acute cardiac event. Troponin peaked at 0.27 and trended down to 0.11. An echo is not consistent with cardiogenic shock, and cardiology is following up. There is concern for pulmonary embolism (PE), initially on heparin gtt, but a CTA showed no PE, so heparin gtt has been discontinued. Septic shock is also considered due to leukocytosis, but the patient is afebrile, lactates are within normal limits, and no obvious source of infection has been identified. Pressors have been stopped, and episodes of hypertension occurred yesterday.

2. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive in the 180"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, now with possible blood loss
   anemia.
   # Unresponsive events: Ddx includes (i) ACS (+mild CE, STE) currently
   on medical management with asa, BB, statin, ACEi (heparin held for
   concern of active bleeding in setting of HCT drop and bruising).  (ii)
   infection of unclear etiology given leukocytosis; currently on empiric
   vanc and pip/tazo. Pan cx today and if these neg will d/c abx.  (iii)
   PE unlikely, negative CTA. (iv) non convulsive status epilepticus (head
   CT negative for lesion/bleed): checking EEG today.
   # Respiratory Failure precipirate by hypoxia and volume overload
   (25lt+LOS):  concurrent metabolic alkalosis may complicate weaning
   efforts. Furosemide diuresis with neg 1Lt daily goal. Add acetazolamide
   for met alkalosis.
   # Normocytic anemia:  Hct stable at 34.8 after pRBC [**2198-6-3**]. Multiple
   echymosses but CT abdomen negative for overt bleed. Holding Heparin ggt
   currently  (trace guaiac + stools).  Follow tid HCT (>24), PPI,
   hemolysis labs before next transfusion.
   # Hypertension: triggered by position changes and discomfort. No
   association with Kausmal respiration or bradycardia. Managing with
   metoprolol, captopril and prn hydralazine.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Head CT after episode of unresponsiveness on
   [**5-31**] demonstrating acute changes. Pt intubated.
   - Repeat head CT shows no acute intracranial process.
   # Transaminitis:  hepatic hypoperfusion. Monitoring levels (ALT 31, AST
   67 on [**2198-6-5**]).
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue atorvastatin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who has undergone a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. The patient presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, elevated WBC count, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. There are also indications of blood loss anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there are signs of respiratory failure due to hypoxia and volume overload. This can lead to ARDS if not managed properly.

2. Infection: The patient is on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, indicating a concern for infection. The elevated WBC count supports this possibility. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The ST elevation on EKG and troponin leak suggest myocardial injury, which may be indicative of cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and cardiac function is essential.

4. Non-convulsive status epilepticus: The altered mental status and the negative head CT for lesion/bleed raise the possibility of non-convulsive status epilepticus. An EEG is planned to assess this further.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, now with possible blood loss
   anemia.
   # Unresponsive events: Differential diagnosis includes (i) ACS (+mild
   CE, STE) currently on medical management with asa, BB, statin, ACEi
   (heparin held for concern of active bleeding in setting of HCT drop and
   bruising).  (ii) infection of unclear etiology given leukocytosis;
   currently on empiric vanc and pip/tazo. Cultures show no growth to
   date. (iii) non convulsive status epilepticus (head CT negative for
   lesion/bleed): checking EEG today. (iv) CTA demonstrated no PE.
   - D/c abx as afebrile, wbc decreased, and cultures with NGTD
   - EEG prelim shows encephalopathy
   # Respiratory Failure: Unresponsive event with hypoxia [**5-31**] requiring
   intubation, now complicated by volume overload (25lt+LOS):  concurrent
   metabolic alkalosis may complicate weaning efforts. Initially was
   treated for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.  Given lasix 40 mg IV x 1
   with 850 net negative over 24 hours.  Also on acetazolamide for met
   alkalosis. Last ABG 7.46/54/95.
   - Aggressive diuresis, goal 1-2 L net negative today
   - Continue methylpred 80 q 8
   - MDIs
   - wean vent settings as tolerated.
   # Normocytic anemia:  Hct stable to 31.4 for  34.8 after pRBC [**2198-6-3**].
   Large flank ecchymosis but CT abdomen negative for overt bleed although
   demonstrates mod free fluid in abd. Heparin drip d/c
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT, transfuse for Hct >24
   - PPI
   .
   # Hypertension: Labile BPs. Persistently hypotensive after unresponsive
   event, required 20+ L fluids plus pressors. Now off pressors with
   episodes of hypertension.
   - Continue metoprolol, captopril and prn hydralazine.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Head CT after episode of unresponsiveness on
   [**5-31**] demonstrating acute changes. Pt intubated, unarousable off
   sedation, no purposeful movements.
   - Repeat head CT shows no acute intracranial process.
   - EEG prelim: encephalopathy

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient is currently being managed for possible cardiogenic or septic shock and has a possible blood loss anemia.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and infections of unclear etiology. He is on multiple medications including ASA, BB, statin, ACEi (heparin held due to concern for active bleeding), and antibiotics.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Unresponsive events: Differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with mild congestive heart failure (CHF), infection of unclear etiology, non-convulsive status epilepticus, and cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient is on medical management with aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and ACE inhibitor (heparin held for concern of active bleeding).

2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires intubation due to hypoxia and has developed volume overload with concurrent metabolic alkalosis. He is receiving aggressive diuresis with Lasix and acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis. Ventilator settings are being weaned as tolerated.

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and altered nutrition. He presented with impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, anemia secondary to blood loss, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and chronic respiratory failure.

24-hour events include the administration of metoprolol, panc endoscopy before stopping antibiotics, EEG showing encephalopathy, stable blood pressure below 130, evening lasix, negative fluid balance, addition of fluconazole for fungal skin infection, and discontinuation of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.

Infusions include furosemide (lasix) and midazolam (versed). Other medications include nutrition via Nutren 2.0 at 35 mL/hour.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/41 to 106/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with ventilator support. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and blood product transfusions are also noted.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. The patient is suspected to have cardiogenic or septic shock and possibly blood loss anemia. He has been on medical management with ASA, BB, statin, and ACEi. His WBC count is elevated but improving, and he has no evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA.

The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on CPAP for respiratory failure. He continues to be volume overloaded and requires aggressive diuresis to achieve a goal of 2 L net negative fluid balance today. He is also transitioning from methylprednisolone to prednisone, which will need to be tapered off.

The patient has normocytic anemia with a stable Hct after packed red blood cell transfusion. He has a large flank ecchymosis but no overt bleed on CT abdomen. His heparin drip has been discontinued.

The patient's blood pressure is labile and has been persistently hypotensive after the unresponsive event but is now off pressors with episodes of hypertension. He will continue on metoprolol, captopril, and prn hydralazine.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, now with possible blood loss
   anemia.
   # Unresponsive events: Differential diagnosis includes (i) ACS (+mild
   CE, STE) currently on medical management with asa, BB, statin, ACEi
   (heparin held for concern of active bleeding in setting of HCT drop and
   bruising).  (ii) infection of unclear etiology given leukocytosis;
   currently on empiric vanc and pip/tazo. Cultures show no growth to
   date. (iii) non convulsive status epilepticus (head CT negative for
   lesion/bleed). (iv) CTA demonstrated no PE.
   - D/c abx as afebrile, wbc decreased, and cultures with NGTD
   - EEG prelim shows encephalopathy
   # Respiratory Failure: Unresponsive event with hypoxia [**5-31**] requiring
   intubation, now complicated by volume overload (21lt+LOS):  Concurrent
   metabolic alkalosis may complicate weaning efforts. Initially was
   treated for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.  Given lasix 40 mg IV x 1
   with 850 net negative over 24 hours.  Also Last ABG 7.46/54/95.
   - Aggressive diuresis, goal 2 L net negative today
   - Transition methylpred to prednisone, will need prednisone taper
   - MDIs
   - Acetazolamide given metabolic alkalosis
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   # Normocytic anemia:  Hct stable to 31.4 for  34.8 after pRBC [**2198-6-3**].
   Large flank ecchymosis but CT abdomen negative for overt bleed. Heparin
   drip d/c
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT, transfuse for Hct <24
   - PPI
   - Guaiac stools
   # Hypertension: Labile BPs. Persistently hypotensive after unresponsive
   event, required 20+ L fluids plus pressors. Now off pressors with
   episodes of hypertension.
   - Continue metoprolol, captopril and prn hydralazine.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Head CT after episode of unresponsiveness on
   [**5-31**] demonstrating acute changes. Pt intubated, unarousable off
   sedation, no purposeful movements.
   - Repeat head CT shows no acute intracranial process.
   - EEG prelim: encephalopathy
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - Consider repeat head CT in next few days if MS does not improve
   # Fungal skin infection: On back. Currently on fluconazole.
   -Consider switching to topical nystatin.
   # Transaminitis:  Hepatic hypoperfusion. Monitoring levels (ALT 30, AST
   63 on [**2198-6-6**]).
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue atorvastatin
   # FEN: IVF boluses PRN, NPO, replete lytes PRN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who has undergone a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, elevated WBC count, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient also has respiratory failure requiring intubation, normocytic anemia, hypertension, altered mental status, fungal skin infection, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and is currently receiving various medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's unresponsiveness and hypoxia have necessitated endotracheal intubation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure due to volume overload and concurrent metabolic alkalosis, which may complicate weaning efforts.
2. Infection: The patient is currently on empiric antibiotics for an infection of unclear etiology. There is a risk of further infection development, especially considering the presence of leukocytosis and positive fungal skin infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been persistently hypotensive after the unresponsive event, requiring significant fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. There is a risk of recurrent hypotension, especially with labile blood pressures.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, now with possible blood loss
   anemia.
   # Unresponsive events, AMS: Differential diagnosis includes (i) ACS
   (+mild CE, STE) currently on medical management with asa, BB, statin,
   ACEi (heparin held for concern of active bleeding in setting of HCT
   drop and bruising).  (ii) leukocytosis improving; cx NGTD; vanc and
   pip/tazo d/c

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak, indicating a possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient also has elevated white blood cell count and possible blood loss anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on CPAP. He continues to be volume overloaded, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Hypotension: The patient has been persistently hypotensive after the unresponsive event and required fluids and pressors. This could indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability, potentially due to cardiogenic or septic shock.

3. Normocytic anemia: The patient has a stable hematocrit after packed red blood cell transfusion. However, the large flank ecchymosis may suggest internal bleeding, which needs to be monitored closely.

4. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressures and episodes of hypertension. Proper management of blood pressure is essential to prevent complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or cardiac events.

5. Fungal skin infection: The patient is currently on fluconazole for a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He is currently admitted to the ICU with impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance impairment, hypertension, alteration in nutrition, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, chronic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has an arterial line and PICC line in place. He is being fed through a nasogastric tube and receiving medications for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's condition is critical, and he has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: Due to the presence of multiple lines and tubes, the patient is at an increased risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent myocardial infarction increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias or further myocardial damage.
4. Bleeding: The patient's acute anemia secondary to blood loss indicates a potential ongoing bleeding event, which needs to be"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, and ST elevation on EKG, indicating a possible cardiac event or septic shock. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there are signs of blood loss anemia. He is currently on multiple medications for various conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on CPAP due to unresponsiveness. He continues to be volume overloaded, and aggressive diuresis is needed to achieve a goal of 2 L net negative fluid output today. There is also a plan to transition from methylprednisolone to prednisone and wean FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Normocytic Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable after packed red blood cell transfusion. A large flank ecchymosis is present, but CT abdomen is negative for overt bleed. Heparin drip has been discontinued.
3. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressures and has been persistently hypotensive after the unresponsive event. Pressors were required, but now the patient is off pressors with episodes of hypertension. Continue metoprolol, cap"

The patient's current medications include ASA, BB, statin, and ACEi (heparin held due to concern for active bleeding). His leukocytosis has resolved, and he no longer requires vancomycin or piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on CPAP. He continues to be volume overloaded and is expected to have a tracheostomy mask trial today. Diuretics will be given to achieve a goal of 2 liters net negative fluid balance today, and prednisone dosage will be reduced to 5 mg.

Regarding nutrition, the patient's family has discussed the possibility of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's hyperglycemia is attributed to steroids, and NPH will be added to manage it. He has normocytic anemia, but his hemoglobin concentration has stabilized after receiving packed red blood cells on [**2198-6-3**]. There is a large flank ecchymosis, but a CT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy with permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, and ST elevation on EKG, along with troponin leak. The patient has a possibility of cardiogenic or septic shock and is currently on medical management. His leukocytosis has resolved, and he is being weaned off antibiotics. The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to COPD and unresponsiveness, and he is on CPAP. There are concerns about volume overload and plans to achieve a net negative fluid balance today. The patient's nutrition needs to be addressed, as well as his hyperglycemia, normocytic anemia, and hypertension. He also has a fungal skin infection and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic or septic shock: The patient's sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak suggest the possibility of cardiogenic or septic shock. Close monitoring and aggressive management are required to prevent further complications.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and current unresponsiveness put him at risk for respiratory failure. Ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation support is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

3. Volume overload: The patient is volume overloaded, as indicated by his fluid"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. The patient has possible cardiogenic or septic shock and is currently on medical management. His leukocytosis has resolved, and he no longer requires antibiotics. He also has respiratory failure due to COPD and is currently on CPAP. The patient's nutrition, hyperglycemia, normocytic anemia, and hypertension are being closely monitored. He has a fungal skin infection and is receiving appropriate treatment. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's symptoms of sudden unresponsiveness, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak indicate a possible cardiac event leading to cardiogenic shock. This condition is characterized by impaired heart function, leading to inadequate blood flow to vital organs.
2. Septic shock: The patient's presentation of refractory hypotension and possible infection (elevated WBC count) may suggest septic shock. This occurs when an infection triggers a systemic inflammatory response, causing widespread vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.
3. Respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. The patient experienced sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, and ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, possibly indicating cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient also has elevated WBC count, which may suggest an infection.

The patient's current condition includes being unresponsive, possibly experiencing acute cerebral stroke (ACS) with possible brain injury, as indicated by the AMS (alertness, orientation, and memory). The patient is on medical management with aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and ACE inhibitor (heparin held due to concern of active bleeding).

Additionally, the patient has respiratory failure due to a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and has been successfully extubated. The patient continues to be volume overloaded and is being diuresed to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 2 liters today. Prednisone dosage has been reduced to 5 mg.

Nutrition is being discussed with the family regarding percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is also dealing with hyperglycemia, possibly related to steroid use, and is on NPH insulin. Monitoring and consideration of increasing NPH dosage will be done.

Normocytic anemia is present, but stable after packed red blood cell"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer and a permanent tracheostomy. He is currently unresponsive and has been experiencing refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, troponin leak, elevated WBC count, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. There is a concern for blood loss anemia. The patient has a history of COPD and has been on CPAP support. He is volume overloaded, and the goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance today. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, possibly due to steroids. He also has normocytic anemia and a large flank ecchymosis but no active bleed on abdominal CT. Hypotension is intermittent, and the patient is on multiple medications including antifungals, antibiotics, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's symptoms of sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak suggest a possible cardiac event leading to cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic shock: The elevated WBC count and possible infection could indicate septic shock, which can result in systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and current respiratory support on CPAP indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Volume overload and inadequate weaning from mechanical ventilation can contribute to this complication.

There are concerns about blood loss anemia. He is currently unresponsive, with altered mental status likely due to acute cerebral ischemia or brain injury. He is on medical management with antiarrhythmics, beta blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors (heparin held due to concern for active bleeding).

The patient has a history of COPD, previous unresponsiveness, and CMV infection. He is now on CPAP, successfully extubated, and continues to be volume overloaded. Diuretics are being used to achieve a goal of 2 L net negative fluid output today. Prednisone dosage has been reduced to 5 mg.

There are ongoing discussions regarding PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placement, hyperglycemia management, and normocytic anemia. The patient's hypertension is stable but persistently hypotensive after the unresponsive event, requiring pressors. Topical antifungals are being used for a fungal skin infection. IV fluids are given as needed, and the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth).

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer, who underwent laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. His white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting possible cardiogenic or septic shock. He also has anemia due to blood loss. The patient has multiple comorbidities including impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance impairment, hypertension, alteration in nutrition, anemia, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, chronic respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not in shock), and fungal skin infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has increased LLL opacity on CXR, which raises concern for VAP. Mini-BAL will be done to rule out VAP.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of blood loss and anemia, which may lead to decreased renal perfusion and AKI.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylaxis should"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis, possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, and possible blood loss anemia. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, hypertension, alteration in nutrition, anemia, hyperglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and chronic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and current acute exacerbation puts him at risk for chronic respiratory failure. His recent unresponsiveness and need for CPAP indicate potential respiratory failure.
2. Myocardial infarction: The patient's EKG changes and elevated troponin levels suggest a possible myocardial infarction.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, possible cardiogenic or septic shock, and signs of infection indicate a risk for sepsis.
4. Blood loss anemia: The patient's HCT drop and bruising suggest possible blood loss anemia.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU for sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, and ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak. The patient possibly has cardiogenic or septic shock and is experiencing blood loss anemia.

The patient has respiratory failure due to VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) and underlying COPD. He is also unresponsive, which is likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with possible brain injury. The patient's hypotension is being managed with pressor support, and his unresponsive state is being treated with medical management, including aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors.

The patient has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with steroids and NPH insulin to tighten glucose control. He also has normocytic anemia, for which packed red blood cells (pRBCs) were given on [**2198-6-3**]. The patient's large flank ecchymosis does not show any overt bleeding on the abdominal CT scan, so the heparin drip was discontinued.

The patient has a fungal skin infection, which is being treated with topical antifungals. His nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding with Nutren 2.0 (Full) at 35 mL/hour. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is to continue ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic or septic shock: The patient's sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of cardiogenic or septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt management of fluid and medication administration are crucial.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD, recent intubation, and development of VAP increase the risk of respiratory failure. Frequent assessment of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, along with appropriate antibiotic therapy, is essential.

3. Blood loss anemia: The patient's elevated WBC count, low hemoglobin levels, and evidence of blood loss (bruising and large flank ecchymosis) indicate potential blood loss anemia. Regular monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and ongoing assessment of blood count and coagulation status are necessary.

4. Possible brain injury: The patient's unresponsiveness and nonspecific EEG findings raise concerns about possible brain injury. Close neurological monitoring, including repeated head CT scans, may be required to rule out any worsening neurological conditions.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications related to hyperglycemia. Tight glycemic control using insulin and dietary adjustments is essential.

6. Normocytic anemia: The patient's"

He was admitted to the ICU with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, troponin leak, elevated WBC count, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient also has a history of COPD, unresponsiveness, and CMV infection. He is currently on CPAP and being treated with vancomycin and zosyn.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying history of COPD and recent CMV infection puts him at risk for respiratory failure. His current condition of VAP and being on CPAP indicates that he may have compromised lung function.
2. Hypotension: The patient's refractory hypotension and requirement for pressor support suggest ongoing issues with blood pressure regulation. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Unresponsive State: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to acute cerebral ischemia or injury, which could be a result of ACS or other"

   85 year old man BIBA with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy w/
   permanent tracheostomy p/w sudden unresponsiveness, refractory
   hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, with elevated WBC,
   possibly cardiogenic or septic shock, now with possible blood loss
   anemia.
   # Respiratory Failure: VAP as well as underlying h/o COPD, h/o
   unresponsiveness, s/p CMV now on CPAP. 3.2 L negative overnight, but
   continues to be volume overloaded (9L positive LOS).
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - prednisone to 5 mg and nebs
   - will check VBG prn
   - continue prednisone
   # Hypotension: Currently on pressor support.
   - Holding diuresis and anti HTN meds
   # Unresponsive state: Most likely ACS with possible brain injury.
   - Currently on medical management with asa, BB, statin, ACEi (heparin
   held for concern of active bleeding in setting of HCT drop and bruising
   and not consistently getting BB and ACEI given recent hypotension).
   - EEG nonspecific
   - head CT negative for lesion/bleed
   - Have met with family to discuss goals of care.  Will continue
   updating family. Based on current developments prognosis is poor.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, and troponin leak. His current conditions include respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypotension requiring pressor support, unresponsiveness likely caused by acute cardiac syndrome (ACS) with possible brain injury, and normocytic anemia. The patient is also experiencing hyperglycemia, which is being managed with steroids and NPH insulin. He has a large flank ecchymosis but no evidence of active bleeding on the abdominal CT. The patient's prognosis is poor, and he has been discussed with the family regarding goals of care. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and recent development of VAP increase the risk of respiratory failure. The patient is currently on CPAP support, but further deterioration may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's refractory hypotension and need for pressor support indicate ongoing instability in blood pressure regulation. This could be due to cardiogenic or septic shock, and the patient may require continuous monitoring and management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing several medical complications.

The patient's chief complaint is sudden unresponsiveness, along with refractory hypotension and ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak. These symptoms suggest possible cardiogenic or septic shock. Additionally, the patient has elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infection.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning as well. He is on CPAP and has a history of COPD. He also has a history of unresponsiveness and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is volume overloaded, as indicated by the positive liters of fluid in his lungs.

The patient's hypotension requires pressor support, and he is currently on phenylephrine. Diuretics and anti-hypertensive medications are being held. 

The patient's unresponsive state is likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with possible brain injury. He is receiving medical management with aspirin, beta-blockers, statin, and ACE inhibitor (heparin held due to concern for active bleeding).

An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed, but it was nonspecific. A head computed tomography (CT) scan showed no lesions or bleeding. The patient's family"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and now has a permanent tracheostomy. He presented with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, elevated WBC count, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient's prognosis is poor, and he is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, prednisone, nebulizers, and pressor support. The patient's condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, unresponsiveness, hyperglycemia, normocytic anemia, and a fungal skin infection. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying history of COPD and recent unresponsiveness increase the risk of respiratory failure. Additionally, being on CPAP support overnight indicates a potential need for ongoing respiratory support.
2. Hypotension: The patient's refractory hypotension and requirement for pressor support suggest ongoing cardiovascular instability. There is a risk of further blood pressure fluctuations and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Unresponsive State: The patient's unresponsiveness, likely attributed to acute cardiac syndrome (ACS) with possible brain injury, poses a risk of prolonged or irreversible neurological impairment.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and altered nutrition. On admission, the patient was unresponsive and required mechanical ventilation. The patient has shown improvement in their respiratory status over the past few days, with decreased need for supplemental oxygen and improved oxygen saturation levels.

Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed pressure ulcers, likely due to prolonged immobility and poor nutrition.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function remains compromised, necessitating ongoing mechanical ventilation support.
3. Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient exhibits signs of an acute heart attack, as evidenced by elevated cardiac markers and symptoms consistent with ischemic changes.
4. Aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired: The patient's overall physical fitness is diminished due to chronic health conditions and limited mobility.
5. Balance, impaired: The patient demonstrates difficulties with maintaining balance, likely related to muscle weakness and decreased proprioception.
6. Ineffective coping: The patient's unresponsiveness and dependency on medical interventions indicate ineffective coping mechanisms.
7. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has developed anemia as a result of significant blood loss.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of laryngeal cancer and a permanent tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU for sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG, troponin leak, elevated WBC, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient also has a history of COPD, unresponsiveness, and is currently on CPAP. He is volume overloaded and requires respiratory support. The patient remains hypotensive and is on pressors. He is also in an unresponsive state, most likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with possible brain injury. Other issues include a fungal skin infection, electrolyte imbalances, and possible blood loss anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying history of COPD, unresponsiveness, and recent respiratory support may lead to further respiratory failure, especially considering his current volume overload.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension and need for pressors indicate a potential for continued instability in blood pressure, increasing the risk of organ damage or failure.
3. Unresponsive State: The patient's unresponsiveness, likely due to ARDS and possible brain injury, increases the risk of complications such as aspiration pneumonia, pressure ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis.
4. Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's history of sudden unresponsiveness and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer who underwent a laryngectomy and has a permanent tracheostomy. He presents with sudden unresponsiveness, refractory hypotension, ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak, elevated WBC count, and possible cardiogenic or septic shock. He also has possible blood loss anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's symptoms of refractory hypotension and ST elevation on EKG with troponin leak suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic shock: The elevated WBC count and possibility of septic shock indicate that the patient may be at risk for sepsis and septic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation suggests a risk of respiratory failure, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on ventilation.
4. Unresponsive state: The patient's unresponsiveness could be due to acute cerebrovascular syndrome (ACS) with brain injury, and there is a need for further evaluation and management.
5. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite pressors indicates ongoing issues with blood pressure regulation.
6. Blood loss anemia: The possible blood loss anemia should be considered due to the patient's history and clinical presentation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has not been assessed for skin abnormalities, suggesting possible issues with their skin health.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has a low oxygen saturation level of 94%. This indicates difficulty in maintaining adequate respiratory function.

3. Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient's elevated troponin-T levels suggest a recent heart attack.

4. Impaired aerobic capacity/endurance: The patient's physical activity is limited, potentially due to their current medical conditions.

5. Balance, impaired: The patient has received fluid infusions and blood products, which may affect their balance and coordination.

6. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to respond adequately to assessments indicates potential issues with coping or consciousness.

7. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has received blood transfusions, suggesting blood loss and subsequent anemia.

8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are consistently high, indicating uncontrolled blood sugar.

9. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal laboratory values suggest a severe infection affecting multiple organs.
