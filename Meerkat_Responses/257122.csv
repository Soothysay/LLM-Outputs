   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace

   PGY 1 Addendum:
   Patient seen and examined with medical student and I agree with his
   physical exam and assessment/plan as noted below:
   Patient with a-flutter, plan for ablation this morning. Will d/c dilt
   gtt post-ablation as rate allows. On heparin gtt as bridge to coumadin
   for at least one month of treatment.  TEE this morning without evidence
   of clot. Will restart on ACE-I today and add on BB as bp
s tolerate.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and atrial flutter. He was admitted to the ICU for further management of his atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia in the 110s-120s range despite diltiazem boluses, moderate expiratory wheezes bilaterally, and pitting edema in his calves.

The assessment and plan for the patient include:
1. Atrial Flutter: The patient has been difficult to rate control despite multiple agents. He will need electrical cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to assess for clot in the left atrium. If no clot is present, Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 6092] will perform the cardioversion and ablation. The patient will continue warfarin with a goal INR of 2.0-3.0 for at least 4 weeks.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of increasing dyspnea on exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in 170s on admission. The etiology of his CHF is most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardia is the most likely culprit. The patient will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess if his cardiac function has recovered.
3. Wheezing: Given the patient's extensive history of smoking, he is at risk for COPD. At the outside hospital, he was started on multiple medications to treat presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and he is sitting in the low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in the outpatient environment.
4. Coronaries: The patient has no evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) on EKG, but because his [Location (un) 150] risk score is 20% for myocardial infarction (MI) in the next 10 years, he should be on a baby aspirin.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DMII): The patient has a history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission. Insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of dyslipidemia. He will continue his home lipid-lowering regimen.
7. Hypertension (HTN): The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, his home blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace

   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. Other etiologies,
   such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less likely
   given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse. Either
   way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess if his
   cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely improved
   after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has diuresed
   about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid overloaded
   as evidenced by moderate pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   overnight should be even to slightly (500 cc) negative, but there is no
   need at this time to aggressively diuresed as his fluid overload should
   get better after tomorrow
s procedure. Rate control should be enough
   for him for now to control his symptoms.
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   -          I/O goal net even to slightly (500 cc) negative
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation tomorrow should
   improve his LV function
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG. He is on an
   aspirin for unclear reason. We will hold the ASA for now.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

   1.       We did not restart any of his rate/rhythm medications.
   However, we may use IV diltiazem if necessary tonight.
   2.       We did not restart any of his COPD meds because of the risk
   that they may increase his heart rate and even exacerbate the flutter.
   If he develops respiratory distress overnight that is related to
   wheezing, we may consider ipratropium.
   3.       [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20%, so ASA for primary prevention is
   a good idea to decrease risk of MI in the next 10 years.
   4.       K is 5.2, but right now we can see how he does in the morning.
   CHADS2 is [**2-23**], wish is 4%.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and atrial flutter. He was admitted to the ICU for further management of his atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.

The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, with heart rates in the 110s-120s despite being on diltiazem boluses. He also has been having increased urine output, which seems to increase his heart rate during urination. His blood pressure is relatively stable.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 142 bpm, blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. He is tachycardic and has an irregular rhythm consistent with atrial flutter. His lungs have moderate expiratory wheezes bilaterally.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical history includes congestive heart failure (CHF), which is likely secondary to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. He also has a history of smoking, putting him at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday.
   We restarted his beta-blocker for rate control and he has since had
   rates mostly in the 80s-90s and has maintained NSR.  Because he
   underwent ablation yesterday, he will need to be anti-coagulated for at
   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached. Checking a PM INR would be useful, as we could
   probably d/c the heparin in the afternoon. He otherwise is continuing
   warfarin 5 mg po qd. In the long term, he will probably need warfarin
   even after the one-month post-ablation period, because his CHADS2 score
   is [**3-23**], which puts him at about 6% risk for thromboembolic disease
   without anti-coagulation.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month, possibly in the long-term as well due to CHADS2 score
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix boluses. He
   has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now with
   minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. As over this morning he diuresed 1.2L. He
   could probably benefit from a little more diuresis, but very no more
   than 2.5L for the day. Another bolus of 20 cc IV lasix could be
   helpful. In terms of long-term medications, we restarted him on
   lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid. Since his HR is
   relatively well controlled, but his BP has been slightly high in the
   SBP 130s, we could go up on his lisinopril to 10 mg po qd. More
   complete management is better suited in the outpatient setting.
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial flutter. He was transferred to the ICU for further management of atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday and is currently in sinus rhythm. He is being restarted on lisinopril 5 mg and lopressor 25 mg for rate control, and his INR this morning is 1.9. He needs to continue warfarin 5 mg po qd for a goal INR of 2.0-3.0 for at least one month, possibly in the long-term due to his CHADS2 score. The patient also has congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, which is likely due to excessive sweating and high heart rate. He is slightly fluid overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves, and his I/O goals for today should be -1L. He will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess if his cardiac function has recovered. The patient also has wheezing, which is atypical given his extensive history of smoking, but can be managed in the outpatient setting. There are no signs of coronary artery disease on EKG, but he should be on a baby aspirin due to his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday.
   We restarted his beta-blocker for rate control and he has since had
   rates mostly in the 80s-90s and has maintained NSR.  Because he
   underwent ablation yesterday, he will need to be anti-coagulated for at
   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached and continue warfarin 5 mg po qd.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          appreciate final EP recommendations
   -          f/u 2PM laboratory data
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix 40 mg iv
   bolus. He has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now
   with mild pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. However, his O2 sat has been in the 88-92%
   range, which indicates that he may still have some fluid in his lungs.
   He could benefit from more diuresis, with approximately an additional
   1.5-2.0 L. We
ll give him another bolus of 40 cc IV lasix this AM and
   reassess I/O goals in the afternoon. We hope that his high SBP
   (130-140s) will come down with lasix 40 mg iv bolus, but if it remains
   high he may need to increase lisinopril - more complete management is
   better suited in the outpatient setting. In terms of long-term
   medications, we restarted him on lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol
   25 mg po bid.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg po bid
   -          Lisinopril 5 mg po qd
   -          Lasix 40 mg iv bolus
   -          Goal I/O: 1.5-2.0 net negative by PM (for a total of
   2.7-3.2L net negative, because he already diursed 1.2L this AM)
   -          PCP appointment for further follow-up.
   -          f/u ambulatory O2 sat
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   -          Continue O2 3L by nasal canula
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   -          [**Name2 (NI) **]nue ASA 81 mg po qd
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached. Checking a PM INR would be useful, as we could
   probably d/c the heparin in the afternoon. He otherwise is continuing
   warfarin 5 mg po qd. In the long term, he will probably need warfarin
   even after the one-month post-ablation period, because his CHADS2 score
   is [**3-23**], which puts him at about 6% risk for thromboembolic disease
   without anti-coagulation.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month, possibly in the long-term as well due to CHADS2 score
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix boluses. He
   has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now with
   minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. As over this morning he diuresed 1.2L. He
   could probably benefit from a little more diuresis, but very no more
   than 2.5L for the day. Another bolus of 20 cc IV lasix could be
   helpful. In terms of long-term medications, we restarted him on
   lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid. Since his HR is
   relatively well controlled, but his BP has been slightly high in the
   SBP 130s, we could go up on his lisinopril to 10 mg po qd. More
   complete management is better suited in the outpatient setting.

The patient's physical examination shows mild wheezing in the right lower lung field, otherwise no crackles, rales, or other abnormalities.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 9.4 K/uL, platelet count of 247, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 110 mg/dL, INR of 1.9, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.5 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, magnesium of 1.9 mg/dL, and calcium of 9.4 mg/dL.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net fluid intake of 1,222 mL, output of 480 mL orally, 742 mL intravenously, and a total output of 3,800 mL with a negative balance of 2,578 mL. The patient's urine output is 3,800 mL.

Assessment and plan:
1. Atrial Flutter: The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday. He will need to be anticoagulated for at least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal of 2.0-3.0 is reached. Checking a prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) would be useful, as we could probably discontinue the heparin in the afternoon. He will continue warfarin 5 mg orally once a day. In the long term, he will probably need warfarin even after the one-month post-ablation period because his CHADS2 score is 3, which puts him at about 6% risk for thromboembolic disease without anticoagulation.
   - Metoprolol for rate control
   - HR goals: 80s-90s
   - warfarin 5 mg orally once a day for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one month, possibly in the long-term as well due to CH"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent ablation yesterday which
   successfully converted him to NSR.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial flutter. He was admitted for further management of atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion. The patient underwent ablation yesterday, successfully converting him to normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate in the 90s, blood pressure ranging from 104/57 mmHg to 156/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90% on nasal cannula.

The patient has received several medications, including diltiazem, midazolam, fentanyl, and furosemide. He has been started on lisinopril and lopressor, which were restarted overnight.

The patient has expressed a desire to be discharged before his son's housewarming at noon tomorrow. He has no known drug allergies.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mention of sweats/chills during the two weeks prior to admission, which could have induced his tachyarrhythmia.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed. The patient is responsive but movement, tone, and other neurological functions are not assessed.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet"
