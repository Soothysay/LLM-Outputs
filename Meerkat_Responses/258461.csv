   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   BM yesterday (diarrhea) and TFs started.
   Long family discussion regarding goals of care.  Daughter [**Name (NI) **] would
   like to see if he can improve enough to come home off the ventilator.
   Was discussed that he will likely not be able to breath on his own off
   the machine.  She has a lot of guilt regarding pulling the tube.  Tried
   to reassure her that this was not her decision but was his decision if
   he could speak.  Lawyer to come in on Monday.  Family is in agreement
   regarding no trach; however not ready yet to extubate.
   Need to touch base with palliative care early, perhaps someone can be
   present when lawyer comes in?

   to do what is necessary in order to gain some more time in order to get
   his affairs in order.  Some concern now that daughter/HCP seems to be
   digressing from the discussion last weekend.  Palliative care updated.
   - will try to minimize sedation to keep patient more alert to
   participate in decision making.  Propofol if needed for sedation so
   that it can be rapidly reversed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with advanced ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) who was transferred to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for progressive respiratory distress and metabolic acidosis. The patient's goals of care are to gain more time to get his affairs in order. The patient's daughter is concerned about the discussion regarding the goals of care, and there seems to be some digression from the previous weekend's discussion. Palliative care has been updated, aiming to minimize sedation and keep the patient alert to participate in decision-making. Propofol will be used for sedation that can be rapidly reversed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had resolved anion gap metabolic acidosis with ketosis, likely due to ALS progression and respiratory muscle fatigue. There was also a component of non-gap acidosis possibly caused by normal saline IV fluids.
2. Obstipation: The patient had obstipation, but it has been resolved now that the patient is stooling.
3. Hypertension (HTN): The patient had significant episodes of hypertension up to 190's-210, which may have been related to respiratory distress and held BP (blood pressure) medications. It is recommended to continue IV hydralazine prn (as needed) and oral antihypertensives via GJ (gastrojejunostomy) tube.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with advanced ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) admitted to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been worsening, with efforts to speak and decreased inspiratory volume in the lungs. He is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's acidosis is likely due to ketosis and respiratory muscle fatigue associated with ALS. Non-gap acidosis may also be present due to IV fluids.
2. Obstipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement in about 9 days and is at risk for bowel obstruction. Advance bowel regimen via GJ (Gastrojejunostomy) tube is recommended.
3. Hypertension: Prior to transfer, the patient experienced significant episodes of high blood pressure, which may be related to respiratory distress. His BP medications have been held.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of DVT.

Assessment and Plan:
- Intubation due to progressive respiratory muscle fatigue with progression of ALS.
- Advance bowel regimen via GJ tube to address obstipation.
- Continue IV fluids with D5/w/"

   progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress.
   .
   #ALS - Increased dyspnea and acidosis on transfer likely represent
   progression of underlying ALS.  Patient was intubated over the weekend
   so that he could get his affairs in order per prior discussions with
   daughter/HCP and palliative care regarding goals of care.  This morning
   he states that he trusts his daughter [**Name (NI) **] to have her name on his
   safe deposit box and house deed.  He additionally states that he does
   not wish to be reintubated or resuscitated and that he wishes to go
   home with hospice if possible.
    are to do what is necessary in order to gain some more time in order
   to get his affairs in order.  Some concern now that daughter/HCP seems
   to be digressing from the discussion last weekend.  Palliative care
   updated.
   - will try to minimize sedation to keep patient more alert to
   participate in decision making.  Propofol if needed for sedation so
   that it can be rapidly reversed.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who was transferred to the MICU for progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of hypertension, which has been uncontrolled, and obstipation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/79 mmHg to 196/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented, with clear lungs bilaterally and no evidence of edema. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, and his extremities are moving normally. 

Laboratory results indicate an increased white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormalities in potassium and phosphorus levels. 

The patient's medical conditions include advanced ALS, hypertension, and metabolic acidosis. The plan is to continue with minimal sedation to keep the patient alert and involved in decision-making. Propofol may be used for sedation, which can be rapidly reversed. 

The patient's code status is full code, meaning that all resuscitative measures will be performed in the event of a cardiac or respiratory arrest. The patient wishes to go home with hospice if possible, and does not want to be reintubated or resusc"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 2818**] is a 78 yo M w/advanced [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU [**2-24**]
   progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress.
   .
   #ALS - it is likely that current episode of increased dyspnea and
   acidosis represents progression of underlying ALS.  He has had
   discussions with daughter/HCP and palliative care and goals of care are
   to do what is necessary in order to gain some more time in order to get
   his affairs in order.  Some concern now that daughter/HCP seems to be
   digressing from the discussion last weekend.  Palliative care updated.
   - will try to minimize sedation to keep patient more alert to
   participate in decision making.  Propofol if needed for sedation so
   that it can be rapidly reversed.
   -f/u palliative care recs
   -social work recs

   .#HTN - prior to transfer having significant episodes of HTN up to
   190's-210 likely [**2-24**] respiratory distress and that his BP meds have
   been held for some time.
   -continue hydral 10mg IV prn which seems to be very effective

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress. The patient self-extubated but is now stable on BiPAP. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), blood pressure ranging from 160/79 to 196/85 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm with a normal range of 68-103 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute with a normal range of 15-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and decreased bicarbonate levels. 

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs bilaterally, presence of a Gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tube, and palpable deep tendon reflexes. 

Assessment and plan include the following: 

1. ALS: The patient's current symptoms of increased dyspnea and acidosis are likely due to the progression of underlying ALS. The goals of care are to minimize sedation and keep the patient alert to participate in decision-making.

2. Obstipation: The patient previously had constipation but is now resolving.

3. Hypertension: The patient had significant episodes of high blood pressure, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 2818**] is a 78 yo M w/advanced [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU [**2-24**]
   progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress.
   .
   #ALS - it is likely that current episode of increased dyspnea and
   acidosis represents progression of underlying ALS.  He has had
   discussions with daughter/HCP and palliative care and goals of care are
   to do what is necessary in order to gain some more time in order to get
   his affairs in order.  Some concern now that daughter/HCP seems to be
   digressing from the discussion last weekend.  Palliative care updated.
   - will try to minimize sedation to keep patient more alert to
   participate in decision making.  Propofol if needed for sedation so
   that it can be rapidly reversed.
   -f/u palliative care recs
   -social work recs
   .
   #Obstipation
 Resolved.  Patient is now stooling.
   -cont. feeds via GJ tube
   -colace/senna/dulcolax/miralax
   -lacutlose/enemas prn
   .
   .#HTN - prior to transfer having significant episodes of HTN up to
   190's-210 likely [**2-24**] respiratory distress and that his BP meds have
   been held for some time.
   -continue hydral 10mg IV prn which seems to be very effective
   -cont. po antihypertensives via GJ tube
   .
   #Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis
 Resolved.  On transfer most likely [**2-24**]
   ketosis as well as progressive respiratory muscle fatigue with
   progression of his ALS.  Also with component of non gap acidosis likely
   2/2 NS IVF.  Received IVF with D5 w/3 amps sodium bicarb for fluid
   repletion.  After lengthy discussion w/patient and daughter/HCP, was
   intubated due to progressive resp muscle fatigue with progression of
   ALS as patient
s wish is to buy time in order to allow for him to get
   his affairs in order.

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of ALS who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. He self-extubated and was placed on 100% face tent with stable oxygen saturation. The patient has a known allergy to no specific drugs, and he is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged except for the noted events. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 129/82 to 160/82 mmHg, heart rate between 68-92 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,300 mL and output of 665 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with high flow nebulization and previously had invasive ventilation. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.27, PaCO2 of 27 mmHg, and PaO2 of 50%. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal breath sounds bilaterally, and oriented mental status. Laboratory results show various values within normal ranges.

","The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of ALS and respiratory failure. He self-extubated and was placed back on 100% face tent. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 129/82 to 160/82 mmHg, heart rate between 68-92 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on multiple medications including lopressor, hydralazine prn, guaifenesin, terazosin, tizanidine, and rissole.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 1,300 mL in and 633 mL out, resulting in a net intake of 667 mL. The patient's urine output is 665 mL, NG output is 760 mL, and stool output is 473 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes high flow nebulization and an endotracheal tube with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 26 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.27, PaCO2 27 mmHg, and PaO2 60 mmHg. The patient's Ve (expired volume) is 7.4 L/min.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with normal eye and head/neck examination findings. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory/chest examination reveals bilateral rhonchi. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. Extremities show absent pulses in both upper and lower limbs. Skin examination is warm. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, responding appropriately, oriented to name, and aware of the year. Movement, tone, and other neurologic functions are not assessed.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 8.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 296 K/uL, sodium of 132 mg/dL, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, chloride of 23 mg/dL, magnesium of 27 mEq/L, glucose of 66 mg/dL, and a blood urea nitrogen of 15 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include the following problems: respiratory failure, acute; fever, unknown origin; and constipation. The patient's children are in conflict regarding end-of-life issues."

   #ALS
 Increased dyspnea and O2 requirement likely related to
   progression of underlying ALS with increased difficulty in maintaining
   the work of breathing.  He was intubated over the weekend after
   discussions with him and his daughter/HCP regarding goals of care and
   to allow him more time to get his affairs in order.  Sedation was
   stopped yesterday and patient self-extubated this morning and was
   transferred to face tent and then BiPAP to support breathing/O2 sats.
   After discussion with the patient and daughter present at the bedside
   the patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated and wanted to
   return home with hospice if possible.  Palliative care has been
   following and assisting with discussing goals of care.  Their
   assistance is appreciated.
   - Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2856**] in palliative care, he will stop by later
   today; will see if home hospice can be arranged.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 78-year-old male with advanced ALS, was admitted to the MICU due to progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress. He required intubation over the weekend and was placed on invasive ventilation. The patient expressed his trust in his daughter to manage his wife's care and handle his estate affairs. He declined reintubation and requested to return home with hospice if possible. Palliative care has been involved in discussing the patient's goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to the progression of underlying ALS, making it difficult for him to maintain the work of breathing.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may continue to progress if underlying causes are not addressed.
3. Infection: The patient may be at risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and invasive lines increase the risk of DVT.
5. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and poor nutritional status can lead to pressure ulcers.
6. Malnutrition: The patient may be at risk of malnutrition due to poor oral intake and reliance on enteral feeding.
7. Medication Non-Compliance: The patient's ability to manage his medications independently may be compromised, increasing the risk of non-compliance"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 78-year-old male with advanced illness.
- He was transferred to the MICU 2 days ago due to progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress.
- The patient has been relatively stable over the last 24 hours, maintaining oxygen saturation while switching between a face tent and CPAP.
- The patient's dyspnea and oxygen requirement have increased, likely related to the progression of underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and increased difficulty in maintaining the work of breathing.
- The goal is to get the patient home with hospice care, and arrangements are being made by case management.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status, confirmed with the patient and his daughter.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and increased dyspnea indicate potential respiratory failure due to the progression of ALS and difficulty maintaining the work of breathing.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has been experiencing progressive metabolic acidosis, which can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylactic heparin, indicating a risk for developing DVT, a blood clot in the deep veins of the legs.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient is on pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophyl"

 Increased dyspnea and O2 requirement likely related to
   progression of underlying ALS with increased difficulty in maintaining
   the work of breathing.  He has remained relatively stable
   He was intubated over the weekend after discussions with him and his
   daughter/HCP regarding goals of care and to allow him more time to get
   his affairs in order.  Sedation was stopped yesterday and patient
   self-extubated this morning and was transferred to face tent and then
   BiPAP to support breathing/O2 sats.  After discussion with the patient
   and daughter present at the bedside the patient stated that he did not
   want to be reintubated and wanted to return home with hospice if
   possible.  Palliative care has been following and assisting with
   discussing goals of care.  Their assistance is appreciated.
   - Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2856**] in palliative care, he will stop by later
   today; will see if home hospice can be arranged.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with advanced illness who has been admitted to the ICU for progressive metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress. He has a history of ALS and has been intubated over the weekend. The patient expressed his wish to return home with hospice care and does not want to be reintubated. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/63 to 160/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and low potassium levels. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased inspiratory volume in the lungs and the presence of a GJ tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and decreased inspiratory volume indicate a risk of respiratory failure, especially considering his underlying ALS and the decision against reintubation.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The fluid balance sheet shows a negative balance, indicating a possible fluid deficit. This could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged bedridden state increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can complicate his recovery and"
