   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output >200cc overnight.  Studies on pericardial
   fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30  Monos 10.
   Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - keep drain in for another until at least 4 hours after stops draining
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date.
   -          C diff in setting of recent hospitalization w Abx tx,
   persistent (chronic and unchanged) diarrhea, and rapid rise in WBC
   -          Repeat CBC to make sure it was accurate and check diff
   -          Other stool cultures
   -          SPEP/UPEP
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**], now
   held in the setting of pericardial effusion of unknown etiology.  Not
   currently on anticoagulation though she has a DVT.  No symptoms of SOB.
   -          held lovenox in setting of pericardial effusion
   -          restart lovenox while pericardial drain still in place today
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT, last night w rates into
   170s with significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT
   sustained, not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to
   adenosine.
   - continue metoprolol low dose as tolerated by BP
   # Anemia
   Stable Hct at 25-26. Patient continues to drain out hematogenous
   pericardial fluid, now more slowly.
   - cont to monitor
   # Hypoglycemia
   Episode this AM. Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency,
   insulin-producing or utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased
   hepatic or renal clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Patient had episode of Afib on floor, which she has apparently had in
   past, treated with IV metoprolol without any drop in blood pressure.
   - monitoring on telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - Mesalamine 1200 mg Tablet, three times daily
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   -  primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
   # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pericardial effusion/tamponade. She was transferred from the cardiology service to the critical care unit (CCU) for overnight monitoring after the placement of a pericardial drain. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis/fever, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), anemia, hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, lower extremity edema, acute renal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism. The patient's nutritional status is poor, and she requires further evaluation for potential malignancy. She is currently on various medications and infusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's sudden rise in white blood cell count and low-grade fevers may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly opportunistic given her immunosuppressed state. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of infection.
2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient experienced an episode of SVT with a rapid heart rate and significant drop in blood pressure. This condition requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further episodes and potential complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's stable hematocrit levels suggest chronic anemia. Continued monitoring is necessary to"

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring after the placement of a pericardial drain due to a pericardial effusion/tamponade. 

The patient had a burst of atrial tachycardia, likely atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), with rates ranging from 150 to 170 beats per minute. This caused a significant drop in blood pressure, but the patient remained asymptomatic. The tachycardia was sustained and unresponsive to intravenous metoprolol and carotid massage. It was successfully terminated with 6 mg of intravenous adenosine, with the heart rate initially breaking into the 60s and then the 70s. Oral metoprolol was then started at a low dose.

The patient also experienced a hypoglycemic episode in the morning, with a blood glucose level of 52. There were no symptoms of shortness of breath, and the right groin site where the DVT was identified is clean, dry, with no hematomas or ecchymosis. 

The patient continues to ooze pericardial fluid, with output exceeding 200 cc overnight. The fluid analysis shows white blood cell count (WBC) of 111, hemat"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output >200cc overnight.  Studies on pericardial
   fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30  Monos 10.
   Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - keep drain in for another 24 hours b/c of persistent drainage
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericardial pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**], now
   held in the setting of pericardial effusion of unknown etiology.  Not
   currently on anticoagulation though she has a DVT.  No symptoms of SOB.
   - hold lovenox in setting of pericardial effusion
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT, last night w rates into
   170s with significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT
   sustained, not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to
   adenosine.
   - continue metoprolol low dose as tolerated by BP
   # Anemia
   Stable Hct at 25-26. Patient continues to drain out hematogenous
   pericardial fluid, now more slowly.
   - cont to monitor
   # Hypoglycemia
   Episode this AM. Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency,
   insulin-producing or utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased
   hepatic or renal clearance
   - check LFTs
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Patient had episode of Afib on floor, which she has apparently had in
   past, treated with IV metoprolol without any drop in blood pressure.
   - monitoring on telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - Mesalamine 1200 mg Tablet, three times daily
   # Acute Diastolic Right Heart Failure:
   Patient has significant sacral edema. Likely worsened by acute RV
   backup secondary to impaired RV filling in setting of pericardial
   effusion and tamponade.  She does have history of lower extremity edema
   intermittently for a couple of years, which may otherwise be secondary
   to low albumin.
   # Low-grade Fever:
   Patient afebrile so far during hospitalization, and leukocytosis on
   presentation resolved.  Positive UA, but culture shows <10K organisms;
   was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which were
   discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for influenza.
   Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture- no growth
   to date.
   - Follow fever curve and wbc count
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
   # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

1. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient had an episode of SVT with rates up to 170 beats per minute, which was not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. However, the SVT responded to adenosine administration. The patient is currently on low-dose metoprolol.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient had an episode of hypoglycemia with a blood sugar level of 52 mg/dL. The patient is not on insulin, and possible causes include adrenal insufficiency or an insulin-producing tumor. Further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation earlier in the day on the floor, which was treated with IV metoprolol without any drop in blood pressure. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

4. Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion with ongoing drainage. The etiology of the effusion is likely malignant or infectious due to the patient's immunosuppressed state"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring after the placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/tamponade. The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has ongoing drainage from the pericardial drain, indicating persistent fluid accumulation. Etiology is most likely malignant or infectious, and the patient is immunosuppressed due to remicade treatment for IBD. There is a concern for possible malignancy, and further evaluation is needed.

2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient experienced an episode of SVT last night, which was likely AVNRT with rates into 170s. This caused a significant drop in blood pressure, although the patient remained asymptomatic. The SVT was not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage but responded to adenosine.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient had an episode of hypoglycemia this morning. The patient is not on insulin, and potential causes include adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or utilizing tumor. Further investigation is needed.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on the floor,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now until TTE - consider pulling drain
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - check C diff in setting of recent hospitalization w Abx tx,
   persistent (chronic and unchanged) diarrhea, and rapid rise in WBC
   - Repeat CBC to make sure it was accurate and check diff
   - Other stool cultures
   - SPEP/UPEP
   - blood, urine cultures
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - Mesalamine 1200 mg Tablet, three times daily - consider discontinuing
   mesalamine
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted in attempt to find unifying diagnosis
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and is being monitored in the critical care unit (CCU) after the placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/tamponade. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 112/52 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing some pain from gout.

The patient has a history of IBD and has been on Remicade treatment. She is immunosuppressed and has a small stable nodule noted on her kidney. Additionally, a chest CT during her last hospitalization showed central lymph nodes in the subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm. These findings may indicate potential malignancy.

The patient's leukocyte count has risen suddenly post-procedure, and she continues to have low-grade fevers. Given her immunosuppressed state, there is a concern for opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Blood cultures have shown no growth to date, and the patient is being evaluated for possible malignancy as a cause of her fever.

The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on enoxaparin. She"

   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - ID consult
 immunosuppressed patient with leukocytosis, fever and
   pressor requirement
   - follow up stool culture results
   - blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted
 thinks likely viral infection
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname**], a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pericardial effusion/tamponade, is admitted to the Cardiology service and then transferred to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) for overnight monitoring after the placement of a pericardial drain. She has multiple medical complications including hypotension, leukocytosis/fever, anemia, DVT, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), Crohn's disease, hypoglycemia, lower extremity edema, acute renal insufficiency, malnutrition, hypothyroidism, gout/pseudogout, and depression/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: Ms. [**Known lastname**] initially presented with low intravascular volume leading to hypotension. She received an albumin bolus with marginal improvement in blood pressure. Phenylephrine was started for pressure support, which increased both blood pressure and urine output. No signs of tamponade were observed. The plan is to wean phenylephrine as tolerated and continue monitoring for tamponade.

2. Leukocytosis/Fever: Ms. [**Known lastname**] is immunosuppressed due to Remicade treatment for IBD. She has intermittent fevers, and her WBC"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pericardial effusion/tamponade.
- She was transferred from the cardiology service to the critical care unit (CCU) for monitoring after the placement of a pericardial drain.
- The patient has leukocytosis, fever, anemia, hypotension, and a history of gout/pseudogout.
- She also has Crohn's disease, hypoglycemia, lower extremity edema, acute renal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism.
- The patient's nutritional status is poor, and she has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for about a month.
- She has been experiencing intermittent fevers, and there is a concern for opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
- The patient has a history of depression/anxiety and is not currently on any medications for it.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient had a pericardial effusion that required drainage. There is still some output from the drain, and further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology of the effusion. This can potentially lead to cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition"

   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring after placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/tamponade. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, leukocytosis/fever, anemia, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), Crohn's disease, hypoglycemia, lower extremity edema, acute renal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a potential cardiovascular issue. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Leukocytosis/Fever: The sudden rise in white blood cell count and presence of low-grade fevers suggest an infection. Given the patient's immunosuppressed state due to Remicade treatment for IBD, opportunistic infections should be considered. Potential causes include bacterial infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, or malignancy.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased, indicating a possible blood loss or decreased production of red blood cells. Further evaluation is necessary to identify the cause of anemia.

4. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT):"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She was transferred from the cardiology service to the critical care unit (CCU) for monitoring after the placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/tamponade. The patient has multiple medical complications including pericardial effusion, hypotension, leukocytosis/fever, anemia, DVT, supraventricular tachycardia, Crohn's disease, hypoglycemia, lower extremity edema, acute renal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion that has been partially drained. Further evaluation of the fluid is needed to determine the cause, which could be malignant or infectious given her immunosuppressed state. Monitoring for signs of tamponade and potential reaccumulation of the effusion is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension that were initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. However, the exact etiology of the hypotension is not entirely clear. Infectious workup has not shown any findings, and cortisol levels were elevated, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - ID consult
 immunosuppressed patient with leukocytosis, fever and
   pressor requirement
   - follow up stool culture results
   - blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted
 thinks likely viral infection
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. This can lead to cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition that restricts the heart's ability to pump effectively. The patient's immunosuppressed state increases the risk of infection-related causes such as bacterial or fungal pericarditis. Malignancy is also a concern, given the presence of a stable nodule on the kidney and enlarged lymph nodes on chest CT.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to low intravascular volume or a response to the pericardial effusion. The patient has received albumin bolus and phenylephrine for pressure support, which suggests ongoing efforts to manage and stabilize blood pressure.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and intermittent fevers. These symptoms may indicate an infection, especially considering the patient's immunosuppressed state. Opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) should be considered, as well as potential malignancy-related fever.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreased, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic disease, blood"

","Summary:
The patient is an 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of chest pain and a pericardial effusion. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including gastrointestinal issues, allergies to certain medications, and recent administration of Remicade. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate ranging from 73-98 bpm, blood pressure between 107/61 mmHg and 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient has been receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of lower extremity DVT, which is a significant risk factor for potential complications such as pulmonary embolism or further clot progression.
2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm, but there is a mention of a prior episode of SVT. This can be a potential complication and should be monitored closely.
3. Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade: The patient has a small echo-dense pericardial effusion, which if continues to grow, may lead to cardiac tamponade. This is a medical emergency requiring prompt intervention.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has 1+ edema in the right lower extremity, indicating possible impaired skin integrity. This can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or other skin-related complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): Although not currently present, the patient's history of cardiac issues puts him at risk for developing AFib, which can lead to complications like stroke or heart failure.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal issues and is currently on mesalamine and scheduled for a dose of Remicade. These medications can have side effects and potential complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of diarrhea and is at risk for developing infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note. Additional information may be necessary to provide a more comprehensive assessment."

 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She was transferred from the cardiology service to the critical care unit (CCU) for monitoring after the placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/tamponade. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis/fever, hypotension, anemia, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), Crohn's disease, hypoglycemia, lower extremity edema, acute renal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism. The patient is immunosuppressed due to Remicade treatment for IBD and has a history of gout/pseudogout. She is currently on TPN and has poor oral nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. The patient's hemodynamic status should be closely monitored, and further evaluation of the pericardial effusion fluid is pending.

2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in her right leg. She is currently on heparin gtt for anticoagulation. Monitoring for signs of pulmonary emb"

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. There
   is a very small pericardial effusion around the apex and anterior to
   the right ventricle and right atrium. The effusion is echo dense,
   consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements with
   some stranding c/w organization.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-2-13**], the size
   of the effusion is similar. There is now abnormal septal motion that
   may reflect early constriction.

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion: Effusion stable by TTE. Drain removed. Etiology
   remains unclear. Malignancy remains consideration. Immunosuppression
   puts at risk for infection but workup negative so far.
   Continue colchicine for gout/pericardial pain
   Monitor hemodynamics.
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - continue betablocker.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers, with T: 99.6 today.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long
   period of time and has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with
   negative workup.  Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture
   shows <10K organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on
   floor which were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out
   for influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood
   culture- no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever. WBC is
   trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - Stool negative for O/P. CDiff
ve x1, viral Cx/fecal cx pending.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - continue metoprolol
   - continue amnio
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN until calore count completed.
   - mesalamine dc
   -Per GI may need to hold [**Month (only) 572**] remicaide.
   - GI signed off.
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient has a history of pericardial effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac around the heart. This can lead to cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition where the pressure from the accumulated fluid restricts the heart's ability to pump effectively.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a right leg DVT, which is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the legs. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.

3. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient experienced an episode of SVT, a rapid heart rhythm originating above the heart's natural pacemaker. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and maintain the use of beta-blockers as prescribed.

4. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's white blood cell count rose suddenly post-procedure, and they have had intermittent fevers. This may indicate an infection, especially considering the patient's immunosuppressed state due to Remicade treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further evaluation for infectious causes is necessary.

5. Anemia: The patient has stable hemoglobin levels, but there has been a decrease in the past"

   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. There
   is a very small pericardial effusion around the apex and anterior to
   the right ventricle and right atrium. The effusion is echo dense,
   consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements with
   some stranding c/w organization.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-2-13**], the size
   of the effusion is similar. There is now abnormal septal motion that
   may reflect early constriction.

   Assessment and Plan
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion: Effusion stable by TTE. Drain removed. Etiology
   remains unclear. Malignancy remains consideration. Immunosuppression
   puts at risk for infection but workup negative so far.
   Continue colchicine for gout/pericardial pain
   Monitor hemodynamics.
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - continue betablocker.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers, with T: 99.6 today.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long
   period of time and has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with
   negative workup.  Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture
   shows <10K organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on
   floor which were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out
   for influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood
   culture- no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever. WBC is
   trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - Stool negative for O/P. CDiff
ve x1, viral Cx/fecal cx pending.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - continue metoprolol
   - continue amnio
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN until calore count completed.
   - mesalamine dc
   -Per GI may need to hold [**Month (only) 572**] remicaide.
   - GI signed off.
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's chief complaint is chest pain and a pericardial effusion. The note includes information about the patient's 24-hour events, allergies, medications, changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flow sheet data.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), pericardial effusion with tamponade, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), anemia, hypotension, leukocytosis/fever, Crohn's disease, hypoglycemia, lower extremity edema, acute renal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing colchicine for gout/pericardial pain, monitoring hemodynamics, and ruling out infectious causes for hypotension. They are also being monitored for tamponade, and the etiology of the pericardial effusion remains unclear. The patient is currently on heparin gtt for DVT, and metoprolol is being continued for SVT management. 

Regarding nutrition, the patient has been on TPN for about a month due to poor oral intake but will need a long-term nutrition plan. The TPN is being held until calorie counts are completed. The patient's Crohn's disease is being managed with Remicade, and mesalamine"
