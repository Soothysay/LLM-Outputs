   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo F with PMH of morbid obesity, PAF, DM2, COPD on 2L home oxygen,
   CAD and recent diagnosis of PE who presents from OSH with SOB and
   fevers.
   .
   # SOB: her initial SOB resolved on admission to [**Hospital1 5**] but then she had
   an acute episode once on the medical floor. The DDX for tachypnea,
   hypoxia and chest tightness with rapid onset includes new PE (she was
   subtherapeutic on admission), asthma/COPD flare (she is not moving air
   well and this is quite possible), allergic reaction (she has a strong
   allergy to many medications and latex and has been intubated several
   times for this in the past), CHF exacerbation (unlikely as she does not
   sound wet on exam although limited exam and did not put out much urine
   to the lasix), AMI (unlikely to cause hypoxia and her CE have been
   negative thus far with no change in EKG), pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (unlikely given no hemodynamic changes in blood
   pressure or HR), aortic dissection (unlikely given stable mediastinum
   on CXR and HCT stable and hemodynamics stable).
   -can not do CTA for PE given allergies and she is already on
   anticoagulation
   -LENIs lower extremities to look for clot
   -heparin gtt to treat her PE; hold warfarin for now in case procedures
   are necessary
   -steroids for COPD/asthma flare (and will help if this is allergic
   reaction as well)
   -nebs
   -BIPAP at night per home regimen and if respiratory status declines
   -consider ECHO is hemodynamics change to look at heart and aorta
   .
   # fevers: temperature went to 104 in ICU. Likely source is urine.
   Pannus cellulitis is now resolved. Does have a skin tear on sacrum
   which she says is from the ambulance ride. SHe does have a PICC line as
   well which could be a source of infection. Currently hemodynamically
   stable without signs of sepsis currently.
   -Blood cultures and urine cultures pending
   -continue vanco and ceftriaxone for presumed UTI.
   -leukocytosis now could be stress reaction since not seen on admission
   labs, but will trend and get differential.
   .
   # hypocalcemia: acute hypocalcemia on venous blood gas during acute
   episode. Repleted with 4g calcium gluconate.
   -trend ionized calciums
   -monitor exam. no longer twitching
   .
   # COPD: see above.
   -steroids, nebs, advair, singular
   .
   # PE: continue heparin gtt and coumadin to make INR therapeutic.
   .
   # afib: continue metoprolol. Currently mildly tachycardic (likely
   secondary to albuterol nebs and respiratory distress).
   .
   # CAD: not on asa given allergy. Continue BB as above. Not on statin=
   unclear why.
   .
   # DM2: continue insulin scale; hold metformin for now in case imaging
   is attempted.
   .
   # depression: continue sertraline
   .
   # chronic pain: continue gabapentin and tramadol
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now. mIVF. Monitor lytes.
   .
   # PPX: heparin gtt for anticoagulation. H2 blocker per home regimen for
   GI ppx. bowel regimen.
   .
   # Code: pt was DNR/DNI but reversed her code status during her trigger.
   Will reassess when stable. Currently full code.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, pulmonary embolism (PE), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and depression. She was admitted to the hospital due to shortness of breath (SOB) and fevers. The patient has had several acute episodes since admission, including an initial SOB episode that resolved but then she experienced another one on the medical floor. She also presented with chest tightness, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

The patient has multiple allergies, including latex, penicillins, shellfish, ibuprofen, codeine, bactrim, and aspirin. She is currently on various medications such as heparin, warfarin, steroids, nebs, BIPAP, echo, and calcium gluconate.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 104.9Â°F, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/42 mmHg to 149/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 67%. She is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has distant lung sounds with shallow breathing. The patient's physical examination reveals morbid obesity, discomfort, and distress,"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with admission with fever and dyspnea in the setting of
   COPD recently admitted with similar complaints and diagnosed with PE by
   clinical findings given history of an allergy for Shellfish.  Now
   patiet returned following discharge on treatment for cellulitis and
   PE.  Now patient with recurrent admission to [**Hospital1 5**] with fever and
   possible UTI Rx'd with CTX.  Despite this patient on the medical floor
   had acute respiratory distress with cyanosis and band-like chest
   discomfort.  Unifying diagnosis is difficult to determine but this
   acute paroxysm of respiratory distress, chest pain and fever with rapid
   resolution is quite consistent with allergen or toxin mediated
   reaction.  The severely elevated fever does have possible explanations
   with syndromes such as NMS, Sertonin Syndrome but his all seems
   unlikley and rather this may be an atypical syndromic response to
   allergin or toxin vs. manifestation of bactermia.
 Sepsis
   -Will continue Vanco/CTX
   -Likley represents manifestation of sepsis with possible urinary source
   and now with positive blood cultures
   -Follow up cultures and sensitivities
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   -Bronchodilators PRN and BIPAP to continue
   -Likley represents broncchospasm and possible irritants with transient

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress, chest pain, and sepsis.
- She has a history of COPD, recent admission with similar complaints, and diagnosis of PE due to shellfish allergy.
- The patient was discharged and returned with treatment for cellulitis and PE but developed acute respiratory distress with cyanosis and chest discomfort.
- She was admitted to the medical floor but had an acute paroxysm of respiratory distress, chest pain, and fever with rapid resolution, which is consistent with an allergen or toxin-mediated reaction.
- The patient's severely elevated fever may be explained by syndromes such as NMS or Serotonin Syndrome, but these seem unlikely, and it might be an atypical syndromic response to an allergen or toxin rather than a manifestation of bacteremia.
- She is currently experiencing sepsis, likely representing a urinary source and positive blood cultures. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone will continue, and follow-up cultures and sensitivities are planned.
- The patient also has respiratory failure, possibly due to bronchospasm and transient non-cardiogenic edema in the setting of bacteremia. Bronchodilators and BIPAP will be continued, and a repeat LENI is scheduled.
- There is no evidence or volume overload at this time, and there are no significant pulmonary infiltrates on the CXR.

   66 yo F with PMH of morbid obesity, PAF, DM2, COPD on 2L home oxygen,
   CAD and recent diagnosis of PE who presents from OSH with SOB and
   fevers.
   .
   # SOB: Most likely explanation currently is aspiration given coughing
   with food observed on morning rounds.   PNA is unlikely, but was
   started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin in the setting of fevers and GNR
   bacteremia.  LENIs neg for DVT.  COPD exacerbation considered unlikely
   given lack of improvement with steroids and nebs
   -stop vanco & cont. ceftriaxone
   -CXR
   -stop high dose steroids
   -BIPAP at night per home regimen and if respiratory status declines
   .
   # GNR Bacteremia: Likely from urine source.  Awaiting culture data.
   Monitor for signs and symptoms of sepsis.
   -Surveillance blood cultures, urine cultures pending
   - f/u speciation
   -continue ceftriaxone, stop Vanco
   -abd CT to check for kidney abscess given bacteremia from presumed
   pyelonephritis.
   .
   # hypocalcemia: acute hypocalcemia on venous blood gas during acute
   episode. Repleted with 4g calcium gluconate.
   -trend ionized calciums, currently stable
   .
   # COPD: see above.
   - advair, singular
   .
   # PE: -stop heparin gtt as pt. is therapeutic on warfarin
   .
   # afib: continue metoprolol. Currently mildly tachycardic (likely
   secondary to albuterol nebs and respiratory distress).
   .
   # CAD: not on asa given allergy. Continue BB as above. Not on statin,
   unclear why.
   .
   # DM2: increase insulin scale; hold metformin for now in case imaging
   is attempted.
   .
   # depression: continue sertraline
   .
   # chronic pain: continue gabapentin and tramadol
   .
   # FEN: Thickened liquids with speech & swallow study given concern for
   aspiration.
   .
   # PPX: warfarin for anticoagulation. H2 blocker per home regimen for GI
   ppx. bowel regimen.
   .
   # Access: PICC line
 will need to be removed given bacteremia; request
   for PIV to be placed.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, pulmonary embolism (PE), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, coronary artery disease (CAD), and depression. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the emergency department with shortness of breath (SOB) and fevers.

During her ICU stay, the patient has been on several medications, including heparin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, albuterol nebs, Advair, Singular, metoprolol, warfarin, insulin, gabapentin, and tramadol. She also receives thickened liquids due to concerns for aspiration and is on a bowel regimen.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2Â°C (99Â°F)
- Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
- Blood pressure: 150/45 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute (inspiratory)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on BiPAP mask

Physical examination reveals that the patient is morbidly obese, tachypneic, uncomfortable, and in distress. Her lungs sound distant, and she is not moving air well. There is no wheezing appreciated at this time. The patient has edema in her lower extremities and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including morbid obesity, pulmonary embolism (PE), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and fevers, and was found to have Enterobacter bacteremia which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin but these were later stopped. The patient also has hypocalcemia, atrial fibrillation (afib), and depression.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia (PNA): The patient's coughing with food observed on morning rounds suggests that she may have aspirated, leading to PNA.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient has a diagnosis of PE, there is no mention of a DVT. It is important to monitor for signs and symptoms of DVT, such as leg swelling or pain.
3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's respiratory distress and tachypnea could indicate a worsening of her COPD. This should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken if necessary.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and the presence of morbid obesity increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, peripheral arterial disease (PAF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and fevers from the outside hospital (OSH). 

The patient has been diagnosed with Enterobacter bacteremia, likely originating from the urinary tract. The source of the infection is awaiting culture data, and the patient is being monitored for signs and symptoms of sepsis. Antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone, have been started, and vancomycin has been stopped.

The patient also has acute hypocalcemia, which was identified during an acute episode. Calcium gluconate was administered, and the patient's ionized calcium levels are currently stable.

The patient's condition is complicated by several other medical conditions, including COPD, PE, atrial fibrillation (afib), CAD, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), depression, chronic pain, and recent feeding tube placement (FEN). Additionally, the patient has an allergy to penicillins and shellfish, and is allergic to codeine.

The patient's code status was initially do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), but was later reversed to full code."

The patient was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath (SOB) and fevers.

The most likely explanation for the patient's SOB is aspiration, given the observed coughing with food during morning rounds. Pneumonia (PNA) is unlikely but was initially treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin due to fevers and Gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia. The antibiotics were later stopped.

   66 yo F with PMH of morbid obesity, PAF, DM2, COPD on 2L home oxygen,
   CAD and recent diagnosis of PE who presents from OSH with SOB and
   fevers.
   .
   # SOB: Most likely explanation currently is aspiration given coughing
   with food observed on morning rounds.   PNA is unlikely, but was
   started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin in the setting of fevers and GNR
   bacteremia and then stopped.  LENIs neg for DVT.  COPD exacerbation
   considered unlikely given lack of improvement with steroids and nebs.
   Both of these have been stopped.
   -BiPAP at night per home regimen and if respiratory status declines
   - diet per speech & swallow eval.
   .
   # GNR Bacteremia:  Blood and urine cultures growing Enterobacter that
   is resistant to some cephalosporins but sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
   Started on cipro afternoon of [**10-22**] for a 14 day course given
   bacteremia.  CT abd/pelvis shows no perinephric abscess.
   -Surveillance blood cultures
   .
   # hypocalcemia: acute hypocalcemia on venous blood gas during acute
   episode. Repleted with 4g calcium gluconate.
   -trend ionized calciums, currently stable
   .
   # COPD: see above.
   - advair, singular
   .
   # anticoagulation / PE: - INR supratherapeutic now, likely [**1-1**] cipro.
   Hold warfarin today, recheck INR tomorrow and likely restart at lower
   dose (2mg?).
   .
   # afib: continue metoprolol at increased dose of 75 mg TID.
   .
   # CAD: not on asa given allergy. Continue BB as above. Not on statin,
   unclear why.
   .
   # DM2: insulin sliding scale; hold metformin for now in case imaging is
   attempted.
   .
   # depression: continue sertraline
   .
   # chronic pain: continue gabapentin and tramadol
   .
   # FEN: Thickened liquids with regular texture diabetic diet per speech
   & swallow study today; will have FEES study tomorrow.  Patient needs to
   be sitting upright while eating.
   .
   # PPX: warfarin for anticoagulation. H2 blocker per home regimen for GI
   ppx. bowel regimen.
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # Code: pt was DNR/DNI but reversed her code status during her trigger.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and fevers.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/40 mmHg to 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on BiPAP.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is morbidly obese, tachypneic, uncomfortable, and in distress. She has distant heart sounds, irregular heart rhythm, distant lung sounds, shallow breathing, and no wheezing. Her abdomen is described as morbidly obese with a positive bowel sound. She also has edema in her lower extremities.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypocalcemia. Other lab results indicate a positive lactic acid level, normal calcium and magnesium levels, and decreased phosphate level.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a possible previous pulmonary embolism (PE). She presented with respiratory distress and was found to be likely aspirating. The patient has multiple allergies and has received various medications, including antibiotics. She is currently on several ICU medications.

24-hour events include anaphylaxis to penicillins and shellfish-derived allergen, and she received Benadryl for anaphylaxis. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 132 bpm, slightly elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 90%. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.32.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be overweight/obese, with normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and warm skin without rash. Neurologic assessment is not complete due to the patient's condition. Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated blood glucose levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and Enterobacter bacteremia, which is being treated with ciprofloxacin. She also has fever of unknown origin, dyspnea, and a history of PE and cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient is suspected to have chronic obstructive pulmonary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman who presented with respiratory distress, morbid obesity, asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a possible previous pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted due to respiratory distress and suspected aspiration. The patient has multiple allergies, including latex, penicillins, shellfish, ibuprofen, codeine, Bactrim, aspirin, and clindamycin. She received various medications in the ICU, including zantac, ultram, neurontin, SSI, levoxyl, singulair, advair, sertraline, coumadin, cipro, lopressor, and neutrophils. 

The patient's vital signs have been monitored, showing fluctuations in temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. She requires respiratory support with a bipap mask and has an ABG result of ///32/. Her physical examination reveals that she is overweight/obese, with no abnormalities in her eyes/conjunctiva, head/ears/nose/throat, lymphatic system, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory/chest, abdominal area, extremities, or skin. Neurological assessment was not performed.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, pulmonary embolism, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and fevers. The patient was diagnosed with gram-negative bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae, which is sensitive to ciprofloxacin. She was started on a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed no perinephric abscess, and the patient clinically improved. She also had hypocalcemia, which was treated with calcium gluconate. The patient's respiratory status has been managed with BiPAP at night and nebulizer treatments. Her diet has been advanced to a full diet with precautions to sit upright while eating. The patient's anticoagulation therapy was adjusted due to a supratherapeutic INR level. The patient's code status was reversed from DNR/DNI to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of COPD and was on home oxygen. She presented with SOB and fevers, indicating possible respiratory infection or exacerbation of COPD. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of COPD.

2. Bacteremia and Infection: The patient was diagnosed with gram-negative bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo F with PMH of morbid obesity, PAF, DM2, COPD on 2L home oxygen,
   CAD and recent diagnosis of PE who presents from OSH with SOB and
   fevers.
   .
   # SOB: Most likely explanation currently is aspiration given coughing
   with food observed on morning rounds.   PNA is unlikely, but was
   started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin in the setting of fevers and GNR
   bacteremia and then stopped.  LENIs neg for DVT.  COPD exacerbation
   considered unlikely given lack of improvement with steroids and nebs.
   Both of these have been stopped.
   -BiPAP at night per home regimen and if respiratory status declines
   - diet per speech & swallow eval.
   .
   # GNR Bacteremia:  Blood and urine cultures growing Enterobacter that
   is resistant to some cephalosporins but sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
   Started on cipro afternoon of [**10-22**] for a 14 day course given
   bacteremia.  CT abd/pelvis shows no perinephric abscess.
   -Surveillance blood cultures
   .
   # hypocalcemia: acute hypocalcemia on venous blood gas during acute
   episode. Repleted with 4g calcium gluconate.
   -trend ionized calciums, currently stable
   .
   # COPD: see above.
   - advair, singular
   .
   # anticoagulation / PE: - INR supratherapeutic now, likely [**1-1**] cipro.
   Hold warfarin today, recheck INR tomorrow and likely restart at lower
   dose (2mg?).
   .
   # afib: continue metoprolol at increased dose of 75 mg TID.
   .
   # CAD: not on asa given allergy. Continue BB as above. Not on statin,
   unclear why.
   .
   # DM2: insulin sliding scale; hold metformin for now in case imaging is
   attempted.
   .
   # depression: continue sertraline
   .
   # chronic pain: continue gabapentin and tramadol
   .
   # FEN: Thickened liquids with regular texture diabetic diet per speech
   & swallow study today; will have FEES study tomorrow.  Patient needs to
   be sitting upright while eating.
   .
   # PPX: warfarin for anticoagulation. H2 blocker per home regimen for GI
   ppx. bowel regimen.
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # Code: pt was DNR/DNI but reversed her code status during her trigger.
   Will reassess when stable. Currently full code.
   .
   # Dispo: Patient will likely return to [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, pulmonary embolism (PE), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and depression. She was admitted from the outside hospital with shortness of breath (SOB) and fevers. The most likely explanation for her SOB is aspiration due to coughing with food observed during morning rounds. Pneumonia (PNA) is unlikely, but she was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin due to fevers and gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. However, the antibiotic treatment was stopped as the blood and urine cultures grew Enterobacter, which is resistant to some cephalosporins but sensitive to ciprofloxacin. She has been started on a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/68 to 141/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. She is tachypneic, uncomfortable appearing, and in distress. Her physical examination shows distant heart sounds with no murmur appreciated, distant lung sounds with shallow breathing, and edema in the"

She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has a history of allergies to latex, penicillins, shellfish, ibuprofen, codeine, clindamycin, Bactrim, and aspirin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/52 mmHg to 160/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, has crackles and wheezes in her lungs, diminished pulses in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurologic examination is not fully assessed.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and normal liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and is being treated for a bacterial infection caused by Enterobacter cloacae.

The patient's medical history includes pulmonary embolism, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and a previous episode of respiratory failure. The patient is currently on multiple medications including ran"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with respiratory failure, morbid obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, fever of unknown origin, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, cardiac dysrhythmia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), blood pressure ranging from 160/89 mmHg to 107/52 mmHg, heart rate between 75 and 113 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, slightly elevated platelet count, normal creatinine level, and slightly elevated glucose level. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, differential white blood cell count, lactic acid level, calcium level, magnesium level, and phosphate level are within normal range or do not indicate any specific complications.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.30. The physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in both lungs, peripheral pulses with diminished dorsalis pedis (DP) pulses, and inability to stand due to musculoskeletal"
