   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  Unlikely to be haveing significant reaccumilation of
   pericardial fluid.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated
   effusion in the right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past
   - continue dapsone and fluconazole
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis
   - urine lytes
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old gentleman with advanced AIDS, presenting with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. He has a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and has undergone a pericardiocentesis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 129/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as increased creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels. The patient's CD4 count is 1, indicating advanced immunosuppression.

Assessment and plan include renal failure, fever of unknown origin, pericardial effusion with tamponade, anxiety, diarrhea, airway obstruction, and HIV infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiorenal syndrome: The patient's renal failure may be secondary to cardiorenal syndrome, which occurs due to transient congestive heart failure from pericardio-myocarditis.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and positive Gram-positive cocci in the pericardial fluid suggest a possible infection. Further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS, presenting with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. He had a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and underwent a pericardiocentesis. The patient is currently in the ICU with persistent fevers, hypoxia, and sinus tachycardia. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 129/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

Medical Complications:
1. Pericarditis: The patient's symptoms and echocardiogram findings suggest pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium. It can cause chest pain, difficulty breathing, and even cardiac tamponade.
2. Cardiorenal syndrome: The patient's elevated creatinine level and acute kidney injury (ARF) may be related to cardiorenal syndrome, where cardiac dysfunction leads to renal dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary infection: The presence of fever, hypoxia, and pulmonary infiltrates raises the possibility of a pulmonary infection, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis.
4. Myocarditis: The elevated cardiac enzymes (AST, ALT, Alk phos, TBili) and the small pericardial effusion suggest myocarditis, inflammation"

   Assessment and Plan
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc levels
   supratherapeutic. Will check daily levels and dose if Vanc level <20
   - continuing fluconazole, doxycycline
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out. Final sputum is due back
   today. Once TB has been ruled out Pt can be taken off respiratory
   precautions
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.8
   - urine lytes
   -Will check urine phosphate to evaluate for possible nephrotoxicity
   from antiretrovirals
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS and a CD4 count of 1. He presents with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. The patient has a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and underwent a window procedure on [**2113-9-1**]. He is currently in the CCU with fevers, hypoxia, and sinus tachycardia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Infectious etiology for fever and sinus tachycardia: The patient's symptoms could be due to an infection, possibly pneumonia or pericarditis. The presence of GPC (Gram-positive cocci) in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning for bacterial infection. The patient is already on vancomycin, but with supratherapeutic levels, daily monitoring of vancomycin levels and dosage adjustment may be required.

2. Myocarditis: Positive enzymes suggest myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle. This could be contributing to the patient's depressed ejection fraction (EF).

3. Pulmonary etiology for hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to volume overload or possibly pneumonia with bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Empyema, a collection of pus in the pleural space, could also contribute to the hypoxia"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc level
   12.3. Pt will need renally adjusted vanc dose today
   - continuing fluconazole, azithromycin
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - Awaiting MRSA sensitivities to Daptomycin and Linezolid
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR--- CXR yesterday w/ no opacities, small pleural effusions
   - f/u i/o, pt continues to autodiurese
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.7
   - urine phos is 11.3. ? consistent with tenofivir nephrotoxicity
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy
   .
   # HCT - drop to 24.2 from 40.8 over 3 month period. Does not describe
   blood in stool or urine. No signs of active bleeding.
   - guiac stools
   - q24 hct  .
   # FEN: regular diet, replete e's prn,
   # PPx: on home PPI, hold heparin given possible pericarditis,
   pneumoboots

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS and a CD4 count of 1, presenting with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. The patient was found to have a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and underwent a pericardiocentesis on [**2113-9-1**]. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing fevers, hypoxia, and sinus tachycardia.

The patient has a history of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis, disseminated Cryptococcus infection, and MRSA soft tissue infection. He is currently enrolled in an experimental AIDS treatment study and has a viral load of 30K.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and low hemoglobin levels. The creatinine level is elevated at 2.7, suggesting renal impairment. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is depressed, most likely due to myopericarditis. There are also small pulmonary nodules suggestive of Kaposi's sarcoma.

The patient has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, doxycycline, fluconazole, azithromycin, and others. His blood cultures and pericardial fluid cultures are pending. The patient is also awaiting MRSA"

   Assessment and Plan
HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME,
   AIDS)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc levels
   supratherapeutic. Will check daily levels and dose if Vanc level <20
   - continuing fluconazole, doxycycline
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out. Final sputum is due back
   today. Once TB has been ruled out Pt can be taken off respiratory
   precautions
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.8
   - urine lytes
   -Will check urine phosphate to evaluate for possible nephrotoxicity
   from antiretrovirals
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy
   .
   # HCT - drop to 30.4 from 40.8 over 3 month period. Does not describe
   blood in stool or urine. No signs of active bleeding.
   - guiac stools
   - q24 hct  .
   # FEN: regular diet, replete e's prn,
   # PPx: on home PPI, hold heparin given possible pericarditis,
   pneumoboots
   # ACCESS: PIV

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS and a CD4 count of 1. He presents with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers to 101, and shaking chills. The patient was found to have a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and underwent a pericardiocentesis on [**2113-9-1**]. 

The patient's current symptoms include fever, sinus tachycardia, and hypoxia. The assessment suggests that the fever and sinus tachycardia are most likely infectious in etiology, with concerns about gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the pericardial tissue and fluid. Myocarditis is also a possibility. The hypoxia is likely due to volume overload, although pulmonary nodules and possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) have been ruled out. 

The patient's past medical history includes CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis, disseminated Cryptococcus infection, and MRSA soft tissue infection. 

The patient's current medications include antiretrovirals for AIDS treatment, fluconazole, doxycycline, and vancomycin. 

The plan includes continuing vancomycin despite supratherapeutic levels, monitoring daily levels and adjusting the dose if necessary. The patient will also be followed up with"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc level
   12.3. Pt will need renally adjusted vanc dose today
   - continuing fluconazole, azithromycin
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - Awaiting MRSA sensitivities to Daptomycin and Linezolid
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR--- CXR yesterday w/ no opacities, small pleural effusions
   - f/u i/o, pt continues to autodiurese
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.7
   - urine phos is 11.3. ? consistent with tenofivir nephrotoxicity
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy
   .
   # HCT - drop to 24.2 from 40.8 over 3 month period. Does not describe
   blood in stool or urine. No signs of active bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS, presenting with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. He has a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, for which a pericardial window was placed. The patient is now in the CCU with ongoing fevers, hypoxia, and sinus tachycardia. He has a history of CMV retinitis, [Female First Name (un)] esophagitis, disseminated Cryptococcus infection, and MRSA soft tissue infection. The patient's current medications include fluconazole, azithromycin, and vancomycin. His CD4 count is 1 and viral load is 30K, and he is enrolled in an experimental study for AIDS treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever and sinus tachycardia: These symptoms suggest an infectious etiology, possibly related to the patient's advanced AIDS and immunocompromised state. The presence of GPC in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning, indicating a potential infection in the pericardium. Myocarditis with positive enzymes is also a possibility.
2. Hypoxia: This could be due to volume overload, less likely pneumonia with bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, or empyema contributing to the hypoxia. Further evaluation with a chest X-ray is recommended.
3. ARF (Acute"
