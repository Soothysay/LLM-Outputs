 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   44 yo F with a history of chronic back pain, found today with altered
   mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia.
   #  Altered mental status: resolving compared to admission.  This is
   more likely [**12-28**] ingestion as opposed to CNS process.  Patient has
   positive tox screen for methadone and tricyclics.  Patient denies
   having taken methadone.  Takes tricyclics at home and this dose has
   recently been increased.  Overdose would result in tachycardia,
   hypotension, and urinary retention, which she has demonstrated. CT head
   negative. Neuro exam non focal.  No ketonuria. If this is in fact an
   ingestion, would continue with supportive care.  Toxicology was
   consulted. Thought this might be amitryptiline overdose, but couldn
   be sure. QRS interval prolonged this morning to 110ms.
   -supplemental O2 as needed
   -IV fluids to keep MAPs>55
   -if becomes less responsive or apneic, would give narcan
   -speak with outpatient providers regarding current pain and psychiatric
   regimen
   -restart MS contin 60mg po tid
   .
   # Hypotension: resolved.  Differential includes hypovolemia vs.
   tricyclic ingestion vs. methadone ingestion. Afebrile. No focal signs
   of infection concerning for septic physiology. Adrenal insufficiency is
   an alternate possibility.
   -f/u culture data
   .
   .
   # Acute renal failure: resolving.  Baseline Cr 0.6. Cr 3.9 on
   admission. Likely prerenal given history of poor po intake over past
   week, and marked improvement with IV fluids.  However, patient had 1L
   retained urine in ED, more concerning for ingestion. Renal US negative
   for hydronephrosis.
   -trend CK
   -encourage po intake. No need for IV fluids this morning.
   -renal consulted -f/u recs

   # Urinary retention: Ingestion vs. obstruction. Likely ingestion given
   overall clinical picture and positive tox screen for tricyclics and
   methadone.

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing altered mental status and has a history of renal failure. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/81 mmHg to 98/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F). The patient's oxygen saturation is at 100% and their heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 35 mg/dL and a creatinine level of 2.1. These findings suggest impaired kidney function. Additionally, the patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 5.4 K/uL and a low platelet count (Plt) of 252.

The patient is receiving various medications, including MS contin (morphine sulfate), heparin sodium, and prophylactic antibiotics. The patient is also on IV fluids and receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals that peripheral pulses and skin assessment were not performed, and neurologic assessment is incomplete. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, indicating acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, further deterioration in mental status, development of infections due to immunosuppression or indwelling lines, and potential bleeding risks due to the use"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   44 yo F with a history of chronic back pain, found today with altered
   mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia.
   #  Altered mental status: Patient has an odd affect, unclear if this is
   unusual for her. Intoxication vs. CNS process. Anion gap of 17. Patient
   has positive tox screen for methadone and tricyclics. Takes tricyclics
   at home and this dose has recently been increased.  Overdose would
   result in tachycardia, hypotension, and urinary retention, which she
   has demonstrated. CT head negative. Neuro exam non focal.  Anion gap of
   17, concerning possibly for ingestion of methanol or ethylene glycol.
   No ketonuria. If this is in fact an ingestion, would continue with
   supportive care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, presenting with altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The patient has a positive toxic screen for methadone and tricyclics, which were recently increased at home. She demonstrates symptoms consistent with overdose, including tachycardia, hypotension, and urinary retention. CT head is negative, and the anion gap is elevated at 17, raising concern for ingestion of methanol or ethylene glycol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension and potential tricyclic or methadone ingestion. It is important to monitor renal function and provide appropriate supportive care.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to intoxication or a central nervous system process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate management.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, tricyclic ingestion, or methadone ingestion. Fluid resuscitation and supportive care should be provided to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which may be related to poor oral intake, acute renal failure, or SIADH. Monitoring and correction of sodium levels are necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain. She was found with altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The tox screen is positive for tricyclics and methadone. The patient's condition is concerning for tricyclic toxicity, which can cause hypotension, tachycardia, and urinary retention. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to ingestion or hypovolemia. Foley catheter placement has been done, and IV fluids are being administered. Urinary retention is suspected to be caused by ingestion rather than obstruction. Hyponatremia has resolved. The patient is currently receiving ICU care and is on prophylactic antibiotics and DVT prevention. Code status is full code, and the patient is being considered for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tricyclic toxicity: The patient's tox screen is positive for tricyclics, and the clinical presentation is consistent with tricyclic toxicity. This can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, respiratory depression, and seizures.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased significantly, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to ingestion, hypovolemia, or other factors. Immediate renal consultation is required to determine the cause and appropriate management.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 yo F with a history of chronic back pain, found today with
   altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and
   hyponatremia in the setting of a tox screen positive for tricyclics and
   methadone.
   #  Altered mental status: Broad differential including hyponatremia,
   uremia, hypotension, or toxic ingestion (methadone or tricyclic
   overdose).  Tricyclic toxicity would fit with her hypotension,
   tachycardia, and urinary retention.  AG 17, HCO3 22.  Head CT negative
   and neuro exam non-focal.
   - Fall precautions
   - Check B12, Folate, TSH, RPR
   - Consider head MRI / neuro consult / psych consult
   # Hypotension/Syncope: Differential includes hypovolemia vs. tricyclic
   ingestion vs. methadone ingestion. Afebrile. No focal signs of
   infection concerning for septic physiology. No further episodes
   overnight.
   - F/U cultures
   - F/U cortisol
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine increased from 0.6 to 3.9, now down
   to 1.1 with foley placement and IVF.
   - Leave foley in for now
   - Appreciate renal consult
   # Urinary retention: Ingestion vs. obstruction. Likely ingestion given
   overall cinical picture and positive tox screen for tricyclics and
   methadone.   Renal U/S unremarkable.
   - Foley in place
   # Hyponatremia: Likely [**12-28**] hypovolemia.  Now resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain. She was found with altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The tox screen was positive for tricyclics and methadone. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hyponatremia, uremia, hypotension, or toxic ingestion (methadone or tricyclic overdose). Tricyclic toxicity fits with her hypotension, tachycardia, and urinary retention. AG 17, HCO3 22. A head CT was negative and the neuro exam was non-focal.
   - Fall precautions should be taken.
   - Blood tests for B12, Folate, TSH, and RPR should be conducted.
   - Consideration should be given to a head MRI, neuro consult, and psych consult.

2. Hypotension/Syncope: The differential diagnosis includes hypovolemia, tricyclic ingestion, or methadone ingestion. The patient has been afebrile without any signs of infection concerning for septic physiology. No further episodes occurred overnight.
   - Follow-up cultures and cortisol levels should be monitored.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   44 yo F with a history of chronic back pain, found today with altered
   mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia.
   #  Altered mental status: resolving compared to admission.  This is
   more likely [**12-28**] ingestion as opposed to CNS process.  Patient has
   positive tox screen for methadone and tricyclics.  Patient denies
   having taken methadone.  Takes tricyclics at home and this dose has
   recently been increased.  Overdose would result in tachycardia,
   hypotension, and urinary retention, which she has demonstrated. CT head
   negative. Neuro exam non focal.  No ketonuria. If this is in fact an
   ingestion, would continue with supportive care.  Toxicology was
   consulted. Thought this might be amitryptiline overdose, but couldn
   be sure. QRS interval prolonged this morning to 110ms.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The patient's altered mental status is believed to be due to an ingestion, potentially of methadone and tricyclic antidepressants. This is supported by a positive toxic screen for these substances. However, the patient denies taking methadone, but admits to increasing her dose of tricyclic antidepressants at home. The symptoms of overdose include tachycardia, hypotension, and urinary retention, which the patient has demonstrated. CT head was negative, and no ketonuria was found. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and her acute renal failure is improving with IV fluids. Her hyponatremia has also resolved. A Foley catheter has been placed due to urinary retention, which is likely due to ingestion rather than obstruction. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and she has been advised to encourage oral intake. Renal consultation has been requested for further recommendations. The patient's glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis measures, and code status are all noted. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Overdose of methadone and tricyclic antidepressants: The patient's altered mental status, hypotension, and urinary retention could be indicative of an overdose of these medications. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The patient has been on various medications including opiates, trazodone, and amitriptyline. A urine toxicology screen showed positive for amitriptyline, suggesting toxic levels. The patient's altered mental status has improved, and she no longer has hypotension or acute renal failure. Her sodium levels have also normalized. The patient admitted to taking methadone from her neighbor, but denies using it at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Drug toxicity: The patient's altered mental status and positive urine toxicology screen for amitriptyline indicate potential drug toxicity. This could be a complication of taking higher doses of amitriptyline than prescribed.
2. Urinary retention: The patient likely experienced urinary retention, which is a known side effect of amitriptyline. This may have required the placement of a Foley catheter.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, which has since resolved. This could have been caused by factors such as hypotension, dehydration, or drug toxicity.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient initially had hyponatremia, which has now resolved. This condition can be caused by various factors, including medication use, excessive fluid intake, or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The tox screen was positive for tricyclics and methadone. The patient's condition has improved, but she still requires close monitoring and medical intervention. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Tricyclic toxicity: Tricyclic overdose can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, respiratory depression, and urinary retention.
2. Methadone toxicity: Methadone overdose may cause respiratory depression, sedation, bradycardia, hypotension, and coma.
3. Hypotension: Prolonged hypotension can result in organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction, including renal failure.
4. Acute renal failure: If not properly managed, acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure and may require dialysis.
5. Urinary retention: Long-term urinary retention can lead to bladder dysfunction and potential urinary tract infections.
6. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state, she is at an increased risk of developing infections, which can be challenging to manage.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines increase the risk of DVT formation.
8. Stress ulcers: Prolonged ICU stay and the use"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 yo F with a history of chronic back pain, found today with
   altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and
   hyponatremia in the setting of a tox screen positive for tricyclics and
   methadone.
   #  Altered mental status: Broad differential including hyponatremia,
   uremia, hypotension, or toxic ingestion (methadone or tricyclic
   overdose).  Tricyclic toxicity would fit with her hypotension,
   tachycardia, and urinary retention.  Head CT negative and neuro exam
   non-focal.   Improved today.
   - Fall precautions
   - Appreciate psychiatry consult for affect and illicit methadone use
   # Hypotension/Syncope: Differential includes hypovolemia vs. tricyclic
   ingestion vs. methadone ingestion. Afebrile. No focal signs of
   infection concerning for septic physiology. No further episodes since
   admission.
   - F/U cultures
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine back to baseline 0.7 with foley
   placement and IVF.
   # Urinary retention: Ingestion vs. obstruction. Likely ingestion given
   overall cinical picture and positive tox screen for tricyclics and
   methadone.   Renal U/S unremarkable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain. She was found with altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The tox screen was positive for tricyclics and methadone. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 142/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Physical examination revealed well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no peripheral edema. Neurologic examination was not assessed.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 280 K/uL, sodium of 94 mg/dL, potassium of 0.7 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 94 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated troponin-T levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging and microbiology data are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's altered mental status may be due to hyponatremia, uremia, hypotension, or toxic ingestion (methadone or tricyclic overdose). Hypotension could be attributed to hypovolemia, tricyclic ingestion,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain. She was found with altered mental status, hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The tox screen is positive for tricyclics and methadone. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Tricyclic toxicity: The patient's tox screen is positive for tricyclics, indicating a possible overdose. Tricyclic toxicity can cause symptoms such as hypotension, tachycardia, urinary retention, and altered mental status.

2. Methadone toxicity: The patient's tox screen is also positive for methadone, suggesting the possibility of overdose. Methadone toxicity can lead to symptoms like respiratory depression, hypotension, and altered mental status.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which can have various causes including tricyclic and methadone ingestion, hypovolemia, or septic physiology.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has presented with acute renal failure, characterized by an elevated creatinine level. This could be due to factors such as ingestion-related urinary retention or obstruction.

5. Urinary retention: The patient is likely experiencing urinary retention, which may be caused by tricyclic overdose or other underlying conditions. This can lead to complications such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage"
