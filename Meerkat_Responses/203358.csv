   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-inch tall male who was admitted to the ICU due to a gluteal hematoma following a recent right hip hemiarthroplasty and re-initiation of Heparin gtt post-op. The patient had a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 27.3 to 23.3 overnight, and a subsequent CT scan identified a gluteal hematoma. The patient's INR is currently 1.5, PTT is 27, and he was taken off gtt Heparin in the afternoon of [**7-28**].

The plan includes continuing to hold Heparin gtt and Coumadin due to ongoing bleeding into the gluteal hematoma. Serial exams will be performed to evaluate for compartment syndrome, and the orthopedic team will follow up. If the patient develops foot drop, the orthopedic team will be contacted for possible hematoma evacuation.

The patient is also being treated for acute anemia due to the right gluteal hematoma. Anticoagulation is on hold until the anemia stabilizes. The patient's Hct will be checked every six hours, and PRBCs will be transfused to keep Hct >21. Daily coagulation tests will be performed, and FFP will only be given if there is a more acute drop in Hct or if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleeding.

Additionally, the patient has a mechanical a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of mechanical aortic valve, ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, allergies to penicillins and morphine, and delirium.
- The patient underwent a right hip hemiarthroplasty and was restarted on heparin post-op due to the mechanical aortic valve.
- On [**7-28**], the patient had a significant drop in hemoglobin levels from 27.3 to 23.3 overnight, and a gluteal hematoma was subsequently identified on abdominal CT.
- The patient received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since [**7-28**] with an inappropriate increase in hemoglobin following 2 units of PRBCs today on [**7-29**].
- Heparin and Coumadin have been held due to continued bleeding into the gluteal hematoma. The patient's INR is currently subtherapeutic, and PTT is normal since stopping heparin gtt.
- The patient's Hct is stable at this time, and coagulation parameters will be checked daily. If there is a further drop in Hct or signs of hemodynamic instability from bleeding, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be needed.
- The patient has a mechanical aortic valve and is off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Gluteal hematoma: The patient has developed a hematoma in the right gluteal muscle and anterior thigh musculature after recent hip surgery. This is likely due to bleeding complications caused by anticoagulation therapy. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) dropped from 27.3 to 23.3 overnight, and they required a transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's coagulation parameters, such as INR and PTT, were subtherapeutic and normal, respectively. The patient is currently off heparin and Coumadin until the bleeding issues stabilize.

2. Acute anemia: The patient has acute anemia due to the gluteal hematoma. Anticoagulation is on hold until the anemia stabilizes. The patient's Hct needs to be monitored every six hours, and PRBC transfusions should be given to keep the Hct above 21. Daily coagulation checks are recommended, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should only be used if there is an acute drop in Hct or if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleeding.

3. Mechanical aortic valve: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve, and they were previously on anticoagulation therapy. However, due to the active bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent orthopedic surgery and experienced bleeding into his hip, resulting in a hematoma. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 27.3 to 23.3 overnight and then further decreased to 24.2% after receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) today. The patient's INR is currently 1.5, PTT is 29.5, and he is off heparin gtt since the afternoon of [7-28]. The patient has been transfused a total of 3 units of PRBCs since [7-28]. The plan includes restarting heparin gtt, holding Coumadin due to ongoing bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, and monitoring the patient's coagulation parameters daily. The patient is also being evaluated for compartment syndrome, and the orthopedic team is following up with him. If the patient develops foot drop, the orthopedic team may consider hematoma evacuation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma expansion or rupture: The patient has a significant gluteal hematoma, and there is a risk of further expansion or rupture, which could lead to complications such as compartment syndrome or vascular injury.
2. Infection: The presence of a hematoma increases the risk of infection, including bacterial infection of the hematoma (abscess) or deep"

   Assessment and Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma. No heparin since yesterday at noon
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable. Will discuss this issue with cards
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Consider starting mild diuresis this evening if BP
   stable.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, mechanical aortic valve, and recent right hip hemiarthroplasty. He presented to the ICU with hypotension and a gluteal hematoma. The patient has been transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently off heparin due to ongoing bleeding. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has fluctuated, ranging from 23.3% to 24.4%. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic at 1.5, and PTT is within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gluteal hematoma: The patient has developed a gluteal hematoma, which is causing ongoing bleeding and anemia. Continuous monitoring and serial exams are required to assess for compartment syndrome. If the patient develops foot drop, contact orthopedic services for possible hematoma evacuation.

2. Acute anemia: The patient's anemia is due to the right gluteal hematoma. Anticoagulation should be held until the anemia stabilizes. The patient's Hct should be checked every 6 hours, and PRBCs should be transfused to keep the Hct >21%.

3. Mechanical aortic valve: The patient is off anticoagulation since July 28th due to active bleeding into the gluteal hematoma. The INR is"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p right hip ORIF complicated by post operative bleeding
   and admit to ICU with significant hemorrhage.  This was in the setting
   of required anticoagulation in the setting of mechanical valve
   replacement.  He now has moderate and persistent bleeding noted
   requiring 1 unit in past 24 hours.  Heparin held since 1pm on [**2128-7-29**].
   He has evidence of significant hemorrhage and external exam
although
   reassuring for no evidence of evolution of compartment syndrome.
 HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH, PACEMAKER, ICD
   BLEED)
   -he has HCT that showed minimal response to 1 unit PRBC
   -Concern for ongoing blood loss is real with ongoing blood loss
   suggested by the limited increase in HCT with transfusion.
   -Will continue HCT check q 4 hours today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent right hip ORIF surgery. He was admitted to the ICU due to post-operative bleeding, which required anticoagulation in the setting of mechanical valve replacement. The patient received 1 unit of PRBC in the past 24 hours and has evidence of significant hemorrhage. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 79-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 66-109 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. He is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 550 K/uL. His creatinine level has improved from 1.8 mg/dL to 1.5 mg/dL, indicating some improvement in renal function. Other lab values, including glucose, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and lipase, are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hemorrhage/Post-operative bleeding: The patient has moderate and persistent bleeding requiring blood transfusion. Heparin has been held since 1 pm on [**2128-7-29**]. The patient's HCT showed minimal response to 1 unit PR"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who experienced bleeding into his hip after orthopedic surgery, leading to a right gluteal hematoma. He was anticoagulated post-op but had a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's INR is currently subtherapeutic, and PTT is normal. He is off heparin gtt but will restart it. The plan is to restart heparin gtt and continue holding Coumadin due to ongoing bleeding into the gluteal hematoma. There are concerns about compartment syndrome, and the orthopedic team is following up. If the patient develops foot drop, the orthopedic team may consider hematoma evacuation. The patient also has acute anemia due to the gluteal hematoma, with Hct stabilized at this time. He will have Hct checks every 6 hours and will receive PRBC transfusions to maintain Hct >21. Daily coagulation monitoring will be performed, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be considered if there is an acute drop in Hct or if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. The patient has a mechanical aortic valve but has been off anticoagulation since July 28th due to active bleeding. He will restart heparin gtt today. His INR is subtherapeutic, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent orthopedic surgery and subsequently bled into his hip, resulting in a right gluteal hematoma. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 25.6 to 23.6 after the bleeding episode and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), with a post-transfusion Hct of 26.3. The patient has allergies to penicillins, morphine, and lorazepam, as well as confusion or delirium when given these medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/43 mmHg to 109/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently not on anticoagulation due to ongoing bleeding, but restarted on heparin gtt today. The patient's laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 14.1-14.4 K/uL, platelet count of 550-729 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.4-1.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 108-114 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. R gluteal hematoma: The patient has a significant bleed into his right gluteal region, resulting in a hematoma. There is a risk of continued bleeding, compartment syndrome, and potential need for hematoma evacuation if it compromises blood flow to the lower extremities.
2. Acute anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped due to the bleeding episode. Continued monitoring and transfusion may be required to maintain an adequate blood volume and prevent complications related to hypoperfusion.
3. Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the low normal range, and there have been episodes of hypotension. This could be due to the bleeding, orthostatic changes, or other factors. Careful monitoring and fluid resuscitation as needed are essential.
4. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease, with an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 45%. There is a concern for cardiac dysfunction and the need for ongoing management of the patient's cardiovascular status.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has had a hypotensive episode, which can lead to acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and maintaining adequate kidney perfusion are crucial.
6. Delirium: The patient has been reported to be confused and disoriented, which may be related to the recent surgery, medications, or other factors. Frequent reorientation and avoidance of certain medications that may worsen delirium are recommended.
7. Cardiovascular instability: Given the patient's history of cardiac disease and recent bleeding episode, there is a risk of cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary.

Please note that the patient's condition is complex, and this summary is based on the provided information. It is important"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. With fall in Hct by 2 points
   last night [**7-31**], stopped gtt and transfused 1 unit
   -Restart Heparin gtt slowly (no bolus doses) and continue to hold
   coumadin given continued bleeding into gluteal hematoma but strong
   medical indication for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt yesterday, held overnight and restarted this
   morning recognizing that the hct drop may be an ooze into his hip vs
   bleed from other source
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Start back on BBlocker at low dose
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -resume BB at low dose today
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of mechanical aortic valve who underwent orthopedic surgery and developed a right gluteal hematoma due to anticoagulation. He presented with hypotension and acute anemia. The patient's INR was initially elevated, but has since been brought down to an appropriate level. The patient received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable with an Hct of 26.3%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: There is a risk of rebleeding in the gluteal hematoma due to continued anticoagulation. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory values, particularly INR and PTT, is necessary.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient may develop compartment syndrome if the gluteal hematoma continues to expand and compress the surrounding tissues. Serial exams should be performed to evaluate for compartment syndrome.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at increased risk of developing DVT due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic compression devices and heparin infusion should be continued.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient had an episode of hypotension, which may have led to acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function through daily assessment of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent surgery for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of his right hip. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to post-operative bleeding in the setting of required anticoagulation for a mechanical heart valve. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has decreased from 25.6 to 23.6 over the past two days. There is no evidence of hemodynamic compromise or worsening pain at the surgical site. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 86/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, morphine, and lorazepam, as well as cough with ACE inhibitors. He is currently receiving various medications including infusions, other ICU medications, and changes to his medical and family history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage/Post-operative bleeding: The patient has experienced post-operative bleeding, leading to a decrease in HCT. Close monitoring and repeat HCT measurements are necessary to assess the need for additional blood transfusion or interventions.
2. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss: Due to the bleeding, the patient may develop acute anemia. Blood transfusion may be required to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. With fall in Hct by 2 points
   last night [**7-31**], stopped gtt and transfused 1 unit
   -Restart Heparin gtt slowly (no bolus doses) and continue to hold
   coumadin given continued bleeding into gluteal hematoma but strong
   medical indication for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt yesterday, held overnight and restarted this
   morning recognizing that the hct drop may be an ooze into his hip vs
   bleed from other source
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Start back on BBlocker at low dose
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -resume BB at low dose today
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent ortho surgery and bled into his hip, resulting in a hematoma. He was anticoagulated post-op but developed hypotension and orthostatic hypotension. The patient also has ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 45% and acute renal failure. He has a history of delirium and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. R gluteal hematoma: The patient has a hematoma in the right gluteal region due to bleeding from the hip surgery. There is a risk of compartment syndrome and possible hematoma evacuation if foot drop occurs.
2. Acute Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are low, indicating acute anemia. This may require blood transfusion to maintain Hct above 24.
3. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants increases the risk of bleeding. Coumadin should be held until the bleeding issues stabilize.
4. Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 90s-100s, and currently in the 80s/60s. This may be due to the hematoma or orthostatic hypotension. Tele monitoring, IV fluid resuscitation, and starting a beta-blocker at a low dose are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent orthopedic surgery and experienced bleeding into his hip, resulting in a hematoma and drop in hemoglobin concentration.
- The patient has been on heparin since the surgery but had to have the dosage adjusted due to a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT).
- The patient's condition has been stable with a hemoglobin concentration around 26.
- The patient has developed a fever, and cultures have been obtained to determine the source of infection, which could be related to a urinary tract infection, line infection, or surgical site infection.
- The patient's blood pressure has been variable, ranging from the 80s/60s to the 90s/100s, possibly due to the presence of a gluteal hematoma.
- The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 45%.
- The patient's renal function is improving following a hypotensive episode earlier in the admission.
- The patient continues to experience delirium, and efforts are being made to manage pain without using narcotics.
- The patient's anticoagulation therapy has been held due to active bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma expansion or rupture: The patient's gluteal hematoma needs to be monitored closely for signs of expansion or rupture, which could lead to further bleeding and potential complications.
