   24 Hour Events:
 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2113-1-31**] 05:03 PM
   -Late in afternoon final CT chest read came back as collapsed LLL and
   decision to proceed with bronchoscopy with hope of clearing secretions
   and improving aeration.  This was completed without incident.  Patient
   received 3mg midazolam IV for procedure.
   -Bronchoscopy revealed narrowed left lower mainstem bronchus ? external
   compression vs bronchiomalacia
   -Pt had been sleeping all day but as persistently sleepy in evening
   attempted to awake and assess mental status.  The patient would awaken,
   follow simple commands, and attempt to speek with some comprehensible
   sounds but still asleep much of the time.  Thus a blood gas was
   performed and showed worsened hypercarbia with ph 7.29 and PC02 of 68,
   repeat gas an hour later showed ph 7.26 and PCO2 of 74, flumazenil
   given and hypercarbia improved with CO2 of 59
   -Daughter called EXTREMELY angry about respiratory failure and decision
   to proceed to bronch without her knowledge and consent particularly
   given concern for respiratory failure.  Reported intention to contact
   quality assurance, [**Name (NI) 98**] [**Name (NI) 2576**], etc..., spoke to all members of the team

   Assessment and Plan
   IMPRESSION: 82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged
   hospitalization who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the
   floor for agitation, hypoxia, tachycardia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: given exam findings, CXR, audible upper airway gurgling, and
   new WBC, an aspiration pneumonia certainly seems likely. He has history
   of empyema and pleural effusions, and unclear how much diastolic CHF
   may be playing a role. Will order non-con chest CT for better
   characterization of lesions, infiltate pattern.
   - Unasyn IV
   - Non-con chest CT
   - pan culture (blood, sputum, re-send urine)
   - patient is tolerating and sating well on a face mask, which we will
   continue.
   - NPO for now, speech and swallow study when more stable
   .
   # Hypercarbia: patient is taking very shallow breaths. Unclear why.
   Treat pneumonia, work/up other etiologies of infection, also CT chest.
   - re-gas
   -family would want him intubated if needed.
   .
   # Delerium: likely infectious in nature, with pulmonary as source.
   Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to lines.
   - treat underlying cause (infection)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: added to problem list to broaden possible causes of
   infectious delerium. While aspiration event likely, bacteremia,
   empyema, also possible. Patient has been afebrile, but should he spike
   a temperature will need to consider meningitis, but my suspicion is not
   high for this at this time. Other source as wellcould be abdominal
   given recent copmlicated surgical history.
   - unasyn IV, can broaden if clinically worsens
   - consider risks of IV contrast to obtain CT abdomen if clinically
   worsens or spikes fevers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of empyema and pleural effusions. He was found to have a collapsed left lower lobe on CT chest, and a bronchoscopy revealed a narrowed left lower mainstem bronchus due to external compression or bronchiomalacia. The patient's mental status was altered, and he exhibited signs of encephalopathy. His blood gases showed worsening hypercarbia, which improved after administration of flumazenil. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is on respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds in the left lung field, increased muscle tone, and evidence of muscle wasting. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and recent abdominal surgery. The patient is not tolerating oral intake well and has been NPO. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status, shallow breathing, and audible upper airway gurgling suggest the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. A non-contrast chest CT is ordered to better characterize the lesions.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and delirium may be indicative of an underlying"

   IMPRESSION: 82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged
   hospitalization who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the
   floor for agitation, hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercarbia: Patient with Hypercarbic respiratory failure yesterday
   of unclear etiology.  Given no know neuromuscular disease, chest wall
   compliance issues, rib fractures, or other mechanical issues that would
   lead to acute change in ability to ventilate suspect central
   hypoventilation.  This could have been precipitated by midazolam but
   may have achieved self-perpetuating status due to depressed MS due to
   hypercarbia explaining inadequate response to BZD reversal.
   -Patient will be intubated for persistent hypercarbia, as this is
   presumed central with holding of sedating meds and correction of
   hypercarbia respiratory drive should resume and this should resolve.
   -Avoid sedating meds
   # Hypoxia: Patient with collapsed left lower lobe and narrowing of
   airways to left lower and right middle lobes.   Bronchoscopy performed
   yesterday with some improvement and removal of secretions.  Still, CXR
   not clearly demonstrating improvement in collapsed lobe.
   - Treat presumed pneumonia w/ pip-tazobactam,  vancomycin, and
   azithromycin
   -Would want to obtain CT chest w/ contrast to evaluate for external vs
   internal airway compromise when patient
s renal function has stabilized
   - pan culture  if febrile (blood, sputum, re-send urine)
   -f/u oxygenation with ABG
   -Hold off on CT  chest w/ contrast for the moment to avoid contrast
   load given [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] try to obtain after stable
   # Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Etiology unclear
   though possibility of pre-renal, infection, and hypotensive insults
   yesterday (SBP
s only dropped to 90
s but possibly could hypoperfuse in
   context of atherosclerosis).
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   -NS at 100 ml/hr *1000ml
   -F/U urine culture
   #  Abdominal Pain/No stools overnight:  Belly is still soft and bowel
   sounds present but given tenderness and hx multiple surgeries would
   have concern for SBO or other process.
   -KUB obtained, will f/u read
   -F/u exams and if worsen proceed to CT with PO contrast
   # Delirium: Patient currently sedated and thus not manifesting
   delirium.  Given infiltrates pulmonary infection most likely source of
   delirium.   Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to
   lines.
   - treat underlying cause (infection) and respiratory derangements
   # Leukocytosis: Improved w/o bands, possibly sign of improvement of
   infectious process.
   # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol in order to avoid risks of
   Afib with RVR with good holding parameters
   # FEN: NPO, will attempt to obtain OG and discuss tube feeds
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI
   # Access: Has one PIV currently will attempt to get additional PIV (and
   consider A-line for ABG
s and follow oxygenation and CO2), as will need
   long-term IV antibiotics we will have a PICC placed
   # Communication: Given family concerns about communications and
   patient
s care will speak to pt relations about best course to pursue.
   Consider SW c/s as well given past relationship with family.

1. Hypercarbia: The patient is experiencing central hypoventilation leading to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can cause respiratory failure and may require intubation to assist with ventilation.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has collapsed left lower lobe and narrowed airways, leading to decreased oxygenation. Bronchoscopy was performed to remove secretions and improve aeration, but further treatment with antibiotics and follow-up imaging may be necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggest a possible pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started to treat the infection.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and the cause is unclear. It could be due to pre-renal factors, infection, or hypotensive insults. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are important in managing this condition.
5. Abdominal Pain:"

   Assessment and Plan
   IMPRESSION: 82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged
   hospitalization who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the
   floor for agitation, hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypoxia: given exam findings, CXR, audible upper airway gurgling, and
   new WBC, an aspiration pneumonia certainly seems likely. He has history
   of empyema and pleural effusions, and unclear how much diastolic CHF
   may be playing a role. Will order non-con chest CT for better
   characterization of lesions, infiltate pattern.
   - Unasyn IV
   - Non-con chest CT
   - pan culture (blood, sputum, re-send urine)
   - patient is tolerating and sating well on a face mask, which we will
   continue.
   - NPO for now, speech and swallow study when more stable
   .
   # Hypercarbia: patient is taking very shallow breaths. Unclear why.
   Treat pneumonia, work/up other etiologies of infection, also CT chest.
   - re-gas
   -family would want him intubated if needed.
   # Delerium: likely infectious in nature, with pulmonary as source.
   Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to lines.
   - treat underlying cause (infection)
   # Leukocytosis: added to problem list to broaden possible causes of
   infectious delerium. While aspiration event likely, bacteremia,
   empyema, also possible. Patient has been afebrile, but should he spike
   a temperature will need to consider meningitis, but my suspicion is not
   high for this at this time. Other source as wellcould be abdominal
   given recent copmlicated surgical history.
   - unasyn IV, can broaden if clinically worsens
   - consider risks of IV contrast to obtain CT abdomen if clinically
   worsens or spikes fevers.
   # History of Afib/HTN: continue metoprolol, though care for masking
   sepsis
   # FEN: npo
   # PPx: heparin SC, omeprazole at home

","The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of recent major gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has a likely aspiration pneumonia, possibly due to diastolic congestive heart failure. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 120/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high-flow nasal cannula with a FiO2 of 60%. Physical examination reveals muscle wasting, absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, increased tone, and rhonchorous breath sounds. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. The patient is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and heparin. The assessment includes hypoxia, hypercarbia, delirium, leukocytosis, and history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. The plan includes treating the underlying causes of these conditions, obtaining imaging studies, and providing supportive care."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2113-1-31**] 05:03 PM--Perfomed after CT results
   final demonstrating multiple airways with complete obstruction and
   significant concern for compression.  He had Bronchoscopy performed
   which revealed significant narrowing at the level of the left lower
   lobe and right middle lobe.  Distal to the narrowing there was
   signficiant secretions seen which were cleared.  He maintained
   excellent saturations throughout procedure with SaO2 >90% throughout.
   COMMUNICATION--Although bronchoscopy was part of ICU consent which was
   discussed, patient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] immediately prior to
   procedure by medical team but not fellow/attending.  Patient family
   members expressed significant frustration and concern that procedure
   was not discussed with them prior to procedure by attending/fellow.
   They also raised the question of sedating medications contributing to
   worsening respiratory status.  I discussed with them upon arrival this
   morning that I regretted not discussing the procedure with them
   immediately prior to performing bronchoscopy but that the indications
   were clear given the evidence of mucus impaction which was seen on CT
   scan and need to evaluate the nature of obstruction and work to improve
   ventilation and oxygenation.  The issues around bronchoscopy performed
   were discussed in detail with the patient
s health care proxy
   immediately following procedure yesterday by the pulmonary fellow and
   all questions were answered and the plan for follow up CT scan was
   discussed when possible.
   WORSENING HYPOXEMIA--Patient with persistent hypercarbia and hypoxemia
   overnight.  He was given flumazenil for attempt to reverse any residual
   effects of benzodiazepine medications with little response.  Patient
   with persistent hypoxemia/hypercarbia/secretions and poor mental status
   this morning. Intubation indicated and discussed with daughter
s x2 and
   agreement for intubation reached with goal of short term trial but not
   to move for prolonged course of trach or chronic ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male admit with altered mental status and admit to ICU with
   altered mental status and likely aspiration pneumonia.
   1)Respiratory Failure-  This is combined hypercarbic and hypoxemic
   respiratory secondary to hypercarbic respiratory secondary due
   respiratory depression in the setting of CO2 narcosis and his
   persistent hypoxemia is likely related to the aspiraiton pneumonia and
   persistent secretions unable to be cleared.
   -A/C to ventilate to target PCO2 of 45
   -Continue with frequent suctioning
   -Continue with Vanco/Zosyn
   -Will place A-line for ABG monitoring
   2) PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION-
   -Continue with Vanco/Zosyn
   -Will follow up with culture results from CT scan
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Will hold on IV contast at this time given worsening renal function
   -There is clearly a component of pre-renal insult
   -Renal dose all medications
   -Check U/A and FeNa to confirm likely pre-renal state
   -Urine flow reasonable
   -Foley in place
   4)Abdominal Pain-
   -KUB this morning
   -Follow exam which will be difficult
   -Will re-evaluate on KUB for possible obstruction and consider CT
   abdomen as possible if symptoms worsening or with concerning findings
   on KUB
   5)H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)-_Remains likely in the
   setting of CVA and hypoxemia/hypercarbia and renal failure.  Will have
   to minimize any sedating medications.
   -Follow exam
   -Minimize sedating medications as possibl
   -CT if acute worsening seen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, with persistent hypercarbia and hypoxemia. 

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which revealed significant narrowing in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe, with secretions present that were cleared. The family expressed frustration and concern about not being informed prior to the procedure. The attending physician discussed the indications for bronchoscopy with the patient's healthcare proxy and answered all questions. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 111/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.27, PaCO2 of 70 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 184.

The patient's physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds with increased use of accessory muscles, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, and symmetric chest expansion. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 167 K/uL, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, blood glucose of 80 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia. The imaging shows bilateral lower lobe opacities consistent with infiltrate/collapse and possible small effusion.

The assessment and plan include:
1) Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to hypercarbic respiratory depression due to CO2 narcosis and persistent hypoxemia likely related to aspiration pneumonia and secretions. The patient will be ventilated to target PCO2 of 45, continue with frequent suctioning, continue with Vancomycin/Zosyn, and place an arterial line for ABG monitoring.
2) Pneumonia, Aspiration - Continue with Vancomycin/Zosyn and follow up with culture results from the CT scan.
3) Acute Renal Failure - Hold on IV contrast at this time given worsening renal function, check U/A and FeNa to confirm pre-renal state, Foley catheter in place, renal dose all medications, and consider CT abdomen if symptoms worsen or concerning findings on KUB.
4) Abdominal Pain - KUB this morning, follow exam, CT abdomen if acute worsening seen or concerning findings on KUB.
5) H/O Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium) - Remains likely in the setting of CVA and hypoxemia/hypercarbia and renal failure. Minimize any sedating medications, follow exam, and consider CT if acute worsening seen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening renal function, pneumonia progression, and further deterioration in mental status."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercarbia: The patient was intubated for hypoventilatory
   hypercarbic respiratory failure presumably due to decreased central
   drive possibly precipitated by midazolam.  With ventilatory support
   this has resolved.  Mental status has improved and probably can work
   toward extubation as impetus for respiratory failure has resolved.
   -Attempt trial of pressure support and follow ABG
   # Hypoxia: Patient
s hypoxia presumably due to collapsed left lower
   lobe, which appears improved on today
s CXR.  The patient also had
   possible pneumonia/vs aspiration pneumonitis.   Currently, he is well
   oxygenated with ventilation but will recheck on pressure support later
   today.
   -Wean ventilator per above with goal of extubation tomorrow, recheck
   ABG after switch to PS
   - Treat presumed pneumonia w/ pip-tazobactam,  vancomycin, and
   azithromycin
   - pan culture  if febrile (blood, sputum, re-send urine)
   -spoke to radiology who feel unlikely there is external compression of
   airway but cannot r/o; deferring exam for the moment until renal
   function improved
   # Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: FeNa of 0.4 most c/w
   prerenal [**Last Name (un) **] though possible element of ATN as well.  Cr improved
   slightly today to 2 from 2.2.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   -NS at 100 ml/hr *1000ml
   -F/U urine culture
   -monitor urine output
   #Pyuria: Patient with probable UTI given pyuria and leukocyte
   esterase.  Organism should be covered with pneumonia regimen but
   following cultures.
   -F/U urine cultures.
   #  Abdominal Pain: Patient denying abdominal pain this AM and softer
   abdominal exam with more bowel sounds.  Will defer abdominal imaging
   for the moment given concern about IV contrast and likely minimal
   utility without as less concerned about luminal process.
   # Delirium: Patient currently sedated and thus not manifesting
   delirium.  Given infiltrates pulmonary infection most likely source of
   delirium.   Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to
   lines.
   - treat underlying cause (infection) and respiratory derangements
   # Leukocytosis: Improved w/o bands, possibly sign of improvement of
   infectious process.
   # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol in order to avoid risks of
   Afib with RVR with good holding parameters
   # FEN: NPO, will attempt to obtain OG and discuss tube feeds
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI
   # Access: Has one PIV currently will attempt to get additional PIV (and
   consider A-line for ABG
s and follow oxygenation and CO2), as will need
   long-term IV antibiotics we will have a PICC placed

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old man with recent major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient had hypercarbia, which resolved after intubation for hypoventilatory hypercarbic respiratory failure. His mental status improved, and he is now likely a candidate for extubation. 

The patient also had hypoxia due to collapsed left lower lobe, which appears improved on today's chest X-ray. There is a possibility of pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. The patient is well oxygenated with ventilation, but will be rechecked on pressure support later today. 

The patient has acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease with a FeNa of 0.4, most consistent with prerenal azotemia. Creatinine improved slightly to 2 from 2.2. Renally dose medications should be given, avoiding nephrotoxins such as IV contrast. 

The patient has pyuria, indicating a urinary tract infection. The organism should be covered with the current pneumonia regimen, and follow-up urine cultures should be done. 

The patient denies abdominal pain this morning, and his abdominal exam is softer with more bowel sounds. Abdominal imaging may be deferred given concern about IV contrast and likely minimal utility without a luminal process. 

The patient has delirium, which is likely due to pulmonary infection. Treating the underlying cause and respiratory der"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercarbia: Patient with Hypercarbic respiratory failure yesterday
   of unclear etiology.  Given no know neuromuscular disease, chest wall
   compliance issues, rib fractures, or other mechanical issues that would
   lead to acute change in ability to ventilate suspect central
   hypoventilation.  This could have been precipitated by midazolam but
   may have achieved self-perpetuating status due to depressed MS due to
   hypercarbia explaining inadequate response to BZD reversal.
   -Patient will be intubated for persistent hypercarbia, as this is
   presumed central with holding of sedating meds and correction of
   hypercarbia respiratory drive should resume and this should resolve.
   -Avoid sedating meds
   # Hypoxia: Patient with collapsed left lower lobe and narrowing of
   airways to left lower and right middle lobes.   Bronchoscopy performed
   yesterday with some improvement and removal of secretions.  Still, CXR
   not clearly demonstrating improvement in collapsed lobe.
   - Treat presumed pneumonia w/ pip-tazobactam,  vancomycin, and
   azithromycin
   -Would want to obtain CT chest w/ contrast to evaluate for external vs
   internal airway compromise when patient
s renal function has stabilized
   - pan culture  if febrile (blood, sputum, re-send urine)
   -f/u oxygenation with ABG
   -Hold off on CT  chest w/ contrast for the moment to avoid contrast
   load given [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] try to obtain after stable
   # Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Etiology unclear
   though possibility of pre-renal, infection, and hypotensive insults
   yesterday (SBP
s only dropped to 90
s but possibly could hypoperfuse in
   context of atherosclerosis).
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   -NS at 100 ml/hr *1000ml
   -F/U urine culture
   #  Abdominal Pain/No stools overnight:  Belly is still soft and bowel
   sounds present but given tenderness and hx multiple surgeries would
   have concern for SBO or other process.
   -KUB obtained, will f/u read
   -F/u exams and if worsen proceed to CT with PO contrast
   # Delirium: Patient currently sedated and thus not manifesting
   delirium.  Given infiltrates pulmonary infection most likely source of
   delirium.   Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to
   lines.
   - treat underlying cause (infection) and respiratory derangements
   # Leukocytosis: Improved w/o bands, possibly sign of improvement of
   infectious process.
   # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol in order to avoid risks of
   Afib with RVR with good holding parameters
   # FEN: NPO, will attempt to obtain OG and discuss tube feeds
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI
   # Access: Has one PIV currently will attempt to get additional PIV (and
   consider A-line for ABG
s and follow oxygenation and CO2), as will need
   long-term IV antibiotics we will have a PICC placed
   # Communication: Given family concerns about communications and
   patient
s care will speak to pt relations about best course to pursue.
   Consider SW c/s as well given past relationship with family.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He has a history of major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. The patient was transferred from the floor due to his altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical conditions include hypercarbia, hypoxia, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, abdominal pain, delirium, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, and fecal incontinence. He is being treated with multiple antibiotics for presumed pneumonia and is also receiving anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and the presence of collapsed lung lobes, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Regular monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial in preventing this complication.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a possibility of further deterioration. Close monitoring of renal parameters, fluid balance, and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications are essential to prevent AKI.
3. Sepsis: Given the patient's underlying infections and compromised immune system, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Prompt identification and management of infection sources are crucial in preventing this complication.
4. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted with altered mental status and concern for significant aspiration and central airway obstruction leading to respiratory failure. He has worsening renal function, but with volume replacement, there has been some improvement in creatinine overnight. The patient's respiratory failure was primarily due to pulmonary infiltrates, primarily collapse, and central airway obstruction with focal secretions. There has been substantial improvement in aeration of the left lower lobe, with decreased secretion volume and yellow in color. There is no evidence of worsening pulmonary infection, and there has been a significant trend towards improvement. The patient's alertness is adequate this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to pulmonary infiltrates, primarily collapse, and central airway obstruction with focal secretions. Although there has been improvement, there is still a risk of recurring respiratory failure if the underlying causes are not fully addressed.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of altered mental status and concern for significant aspiration, there is a potential for aspiration pneumonia to develop or worsen if proper precautions are not taken to protect the airways.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, which could progress to acute renal failure if not managed appropriately. Volume replacement may help improve renal function, but ongoing monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with recent major gastrointestinal bleeding, prolonged hospitalization, and agitation, hypoxia, tachycardia. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to hypoventilation and hypercarbia, possibly precipitated by midazolam. The patient's mental status has improved, and there is a plan to attempt extubation as an impetus for respiratory recovery. The patient's hypoxia is presumed to be due to collapsed left lower lobe, which appears improved on today's chest X-ray. The patient also had possible pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis. Currently, he is well-oxygenated with ventilation but will be rechecked on pressure support later today.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbia: The patient was intubated for hypoventilatory hypercarbic respiratory failure presumably due to decreased central drive possibly precipitated by midazolam. With ventilatory support, this has resolved. Mental status has improved and can work toward extubation as impetus for respiratory failure has resolved.
- Attempt trial of pressure support and follow ABG.
2. Hypoxia: Patient's hypoxia presumably due to collapsed left lower lobe, which appears improved on today's CXR. The patient also had possible pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis. Currently, he is well-oxygenated with ventilation but will recheck on pressure support later today.
- Wean ventilator per above with goal"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has been intubated for hypoventilatory hypercarbic respiratory failure, which was likely caused by decreased central drive possibly precipitated by midazolam. With ventilatory support, this condition has resolved. The patient's mental status has improved, and overall appearance of lung fields/other symptoms is resolving. He has been on steadily decreasing amounts of sedating medications but received more just prior to rounds.

The patient's hypoxia is presumed due to a collapsed left lower lobe, most likely due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and possibly a mucus plug. This condition appears to be improving. Currently, he is well oxygenated with ventilation.

The patient's renal function shows signs of acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, with a feNa of 0.4 most consistent with prerenal azotemia, though there may also be an element of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given the presence of muddy brown casts. The serum creatinine has slightly improved today to less than 2.

The patient has pyuria, suggesting a urinary tract infection (UTI). The organism should be covered with the current pneumonia regimen, and follow-up urine cultures are planned.

The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and the abdominal examination shows more bowel"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course. He is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by central airway obstruction due to mucus, lower lobe collapse that has improved with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and persistent hypercarbia despite minimal changes in respiratory rate (RR). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 115/51 mmHg and a heart rate of 57 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 100% on ventilatory support. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. Imaging reveals minimal change in bilateral lower lobe infiltrates/collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates inadequate ventilation and oxygenation. If not properly managed, this could lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potential hypoxemia.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of aspiration pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus increases the risk of infection spread to other parts of the respiratory system. If left untreated, it may result in worsening lung inflammation, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creat"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercarbia: The patient was intubated for hypoventilatory
   hypercarbic respiratory failure presumably due to decreased central
   drive possibly precipitated by midazolam.  With ventilatory support
   this has resolved.  Mental status has improved and overall appearance
   of lung fields/other symptoms resolving.  Had been on steadily
   decreasing amounts of sedating meds but received more just prior to
   rounds.
   -Turn off midazolam/fentanyl and attempt pressure support trial in [**4-2**]
   hrs.
   # Hypoxia: Patient
s hypoxia presumably due to collapsed left lower

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with recent major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. The patient was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbia: The patient initially had hypoventilatory hypercarbic respiratory failure, which resolved with ventilatory support.

2. Hypoxia: The patient had hypoxia due to a collapsed left lower lobe, likely caused by staph aureus pneumonia and a mucus plug. However, it seems to be improving.

3. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has a decreased glomerular filtration rate (Cr) and a FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) of 0.4, suggesting prerenal azotemia. There is also a possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to muddy brown casts. Renal dose medications should be adjusted, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.

4. Pyuria: The patient has evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI), as indicated by pyuria and leukocyte esterase. The current pneumonia regimen should cover the organism responsible for the UTI, but follow-up urine cultures should be done.

5. Abdominal Pain: Although the patient denies abdominal pain, there is a concern for potential complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercarbia:  This patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and continues to become hypercarbic any time he is not
   maintained on assigned rate ventilation.  There does not appear to be
   an intrinsic pulmonary process contributing to this issue and it seems
   more consistent with decreased central respiratory drive.    It seems
   unlikely sever impairment of drive is due simply to low doses of
   sedatives but no indication of other, more pernicious etiologies at
   this time.
   -Sedation off, will attempt spontaneous breathing trial when this is
   off several hours
   -Attempt to  set lower minute ventilations on AC in order to not blunt
   respiratory drive.
   # Hypoxia: Patient
s hypoxia presumably due to collapsed left lower
   lobe most likley due to staph aureus pneumonia and likely a  mucus
   plug.  This continues to appear to be improved.     Currently, he is
   well oxygenated with ventilation.  .
   -Continue vancomycin and  pipercillin/tazobactam pending final culture
   results
   -Intend for 7 day course of therapy for pneumonia, will hope to d/c
   pip-tazobactam after final respiratory cultures negative
    # Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: FeNa of 0.4 most c/w
   prerenal [**Last Name (un) **] though possible element of ATN as well (given muddy brown
   casts) Cr stable since yesterday.
   -Given decreased edema and increased UOP yesterday will cautiously give
   1000 ml NS and follow UOP and edema.
   -Renally dose medications
    -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.
   -Change foley catheter
   #  Abdominal Pain: Patient continues to deny abdominal pain and exam
   benign.  Continue to monitor.
   # Delirium: Patient w/purposeful movements and nods/shakes head
   appropriately.  Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to
   lines.   No signs of current delirium.
   - treat underlying potential cause of delirium (infection) and
   respiratory derangements
   # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters
   in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He has a history of major GI bleed and prolonged hospitalization. The patient continues to experience hypercarbia, which is a high level of carbon dioxide in the blood, when he is not maintained on assigned rate ventilation. This suggests decreased central respiratory drive. The patient's hypoxia, presumably due to collapsed left lower lobe caused by Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and a mucus plug, appears to be improving.

The patient has acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease with a FeNa of 0.4, most consistent with prerenal azotemia. However, there is also a possibility of acute tubular necrosis given the presence of muddy brown casts. The patient's creatinine level has been stable since yesterday.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male admit to ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failiure.  He now
   has persistent issues with continued and recurrent hypercarbic
   respiratory failure with move to PSV mode of support.  This is in the
   setting of minimal sedation and stabilization of renal function.  He
   has persistent ventilatory failure despite stabilization of renal
   function, continued oral secreations but small amounts from ETT,
   minization of sedation.  He this morning expressed that he would want
   the breathing tube out even though he would die this morning.  This is
   with sedation recently discontinued and patient clearly following
   commands and answering questions.  Sedation off x 5 hours.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -PSV trial today and re-evaluate ABG
   -Some improvement in secretions today with Vanco/Zosyn for ABX
   -Minimal evidence of bronchospasm as a source of hypercarbia
   -He has adeaute motor strength to trigger ventilator
   -Target PCO2-45-50 on ventilator
   -NIF of -8 must be considered
   -With extubation would need to consider role of BIPAP or return to
   mechanical ventilation
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   -Vanco/Zosyn
on day #4
   -Will follow up with culture results
 .H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   -Narcotics off
   -Minimize sedation
   Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue with maintenance fluids across today

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has persistent issues with continued and recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure despite stabilization of renal function. The patient expressed his desire to have the breathing tube removed, even though it would result in his death. The patient's sedation was recently discontinued, and he is able to follow commands and answer questions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there is a need for further evaluation of arterial blood gas (ABG) during a pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial.
2. Hypotension (not shock) - The patient's blood pressure is low, and it needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
3. Pneumonia/Aspiration - The patient has been on antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) for suspected pneumonia or aspiration. The culture results are pending, and the treatment plan should be based on the results.
4. Altered Mental Status - The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to narcotics. Narcotics have been stopped, and efforts are being made to minimize sedation.
5. Acute Renal Failure - The patient has acute renal failure, and maintenance fluids will continue to be administered. Creatinine levels will be monitored tomorrow.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercarbia:  This patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and continues to become hypercarbic any time he is not
   maintained on assigned rate ventilation.  There does not appear to be
   an intrinsic pulmonary process contributing to this issue and it seems
   more consistent with decreased central respiratory drive.    It seems
   unlikely sever impairment of drive is due simply to low doses of
   sedatives but no indication of other, more pernicious etiologies at
   this time.
   -Sedation off, will attempt spontaneous breathing trial when this is
   off several hours
   -Attempt to  set lower minute ventilations on AC in order to not blunt
   respiratory drive.
   # Hypoxia: Patient
s hypoxia presumably due to collapsed left lower
   lobe most likley due to staph aureus pneumonia and likely a  mucus
   plug.  This continues to appear to be improved.     Currently, he is
   well oxygenated with ventilation.  .
   -Continue vancomycin and  pipercillin/tazobactam pending final culture
   results
   -Intend for 7 day course of therapy for pneumonia, will hope to d/c
   pip-tazobactam after final respiratory cultures negative
    # Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: FeNa of 0.4 most c/w
   prerenal [**Last Name (un) **] though possible element of ATN as well (given muddy brown
   casts) Cr stable since yesterday.
   -Given decreased edema and increased UOP yesterday will cautiously give
   1000 ml NS and follow UOP and edema.
   -Renally dose medications
    -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.
   -Change foley catheter
   #  Abdominal Pain: Patient continues to deny abdominal pain and exam
   benign.  Continue to monitor.
   # Delirium: Patient w/purposeful movements and nods/shakes head
   appropriately.  Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to
   lines.   No signs of current delirium.
   - treat underlying potential cause of delirium (infection) and
   respiratory derangements
   # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters
   in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
   # FEN: Tube feeds, 1000 ml NS over 10 hours

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with recent major gastrointestinal bleeding who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient underwent thoracentesis and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given in the note are as follows:

1. Hypercarbia: The patient becomes hypercarbic when not maintained on assigned rate ventilation. This could be due to decreased central respiratory drive. If not managed properly, it may lead to respiratory failure.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is presumed to be due to collapsed left lower lobe pneumonia. If the infection spreads or if there is a mucus plug obstruction, it may worsen the patient's oxygenation status.

3. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has a FeNa of 0.4, which suggests prerenal azotemia. However, muddy brown casts indicate a possible element of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). If not managed appropriately, it could progress to worsening renal function.

4. Pyuria: Although the urine culture is only growing yeast, which is likely a contaminant, the presence of leukocyte esterase and pyuria suggests a urinary tract infection. If left untreated, it could lead to a more severe infection.

5. Delirium: The patient is showing purposeful movements and nods/shakes head appropriately"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercarbia:  This patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and continues to become hypercarbic any time he is not
   maintained on assigned rate ventilation.  There does not appear to be
   an intrinsic pulmonary process contributing to this issue and it seems
   more consistent with decreased central respiratory drive.    It seems
   unlikely sever impairment of drive is due simply to low doses of
   sedatives but no indication of other, more pernicious etiologies at
   this time.
   -Sedation off, will attempt spontaneous breathing trial when this is
   off several hours
   -Attempt to  set lower minute ventilations on AC in order to not blunt
   respiratory drive.
   # Hypoxia: Patient
s hypoxia presumably due to collapsed left lower
   lobe most likley due to staph aureus pneumonia and likely a  mucus
   plug.  This continues to appear to be improved.     Currently, he is
   well oxygenated with ventilation.  .
   -Continue vancomycin and  pipercillin/tazobactam pending final culture
   results
   -Intend for 7 day course of therapy for pneumonia, will hope to d/c
   pip-tazobactam after final respiratory cultures negative
    # Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: FeNa of 0.4 most c/w
   prerenal [**Last Name (un) **] though possible element of ATN as well (given muddy brown
   casts) Cr stable since yesterday.
   -Given decreased edema and increased UOP yesterday will cautiously give
   1000 ml NS and follow UOP and edema.
   -Renally dose medications
    -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.
   -Change foley catheter
   #  Abdominal Pain: Patient continues to deny abdominal pain and exam
   benign.  Continue to monitor.
   # Delirium: Patient w/purposeful movements and nods/shakes head
   appropriately.  Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to
   lines.   No signs of current delirium.
   - treat underlying potential cause of delirium (infection) and
   respiratory derangements
   # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters
   in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
   # FEN: Tube feeds, 1000 ml NS over 10 hours
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with recent major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient underwent thoracentesis and had difficulty with feeding tube placement, which ultimately ended up in the stomach. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 51. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/57 to 188/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 135,000/mm3, creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 90 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low potassium (3.9 mEq/L) and magnesium (2.0 mg/dL) levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 403, and oxygen consumption of 9.9 L/min.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and he is currently on metoprolol for heart rate control. The assessment and plan include addressing hypercarbia due to decreased central respiratory drive, hypoxia due to collapsed left lower lobe most likely caused by staph aureus pneumonia, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, pyuria likely caused by a contaminated urinary catheter, abdominal pain without evidence of infection, and delirium secondary to underlying causes such as infection and respiratory derangements.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of kidney function, development of new infections, and potential cardiovascular events due to uncontrolled hypertension.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, and electrolyte imbalances. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and efforts should be made to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are essential. Regular assessment of the patient's mental status and aggressive treatment of any underlying causes of delirium should be prioritized."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and pleural effusions. The patient has been treated with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Azithromycin) and has shown substantial improvement in mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/61 mmHg to 95/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 168 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 403 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 9.5 L/min. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver enzymes, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level. Imaging reveals improved left-sided effusion and a suggestion of persistent right-sided effusion. The patient's overall condition has improved, with"

   intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to
   chest muscle weakness, extubated on [**2113-2-5**], but required re-intubation
   later that day for worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure.   [**Month (only) 60**] be
   exacerbated by mental status changes from likely continued aspiration
   events. Decreased central respiratory drive does not appear to be
   contributing as patient was tachypneic prior to intubation.   Will
   attempt to treat possible reversible causes of respiratory failure,
   including pneumonia, volume overload if indicated.  [**Month (only) 60**] ultimately
   require tracheostomy.
   - continue treatment of pneumonia, diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - check ECHO to rule out acute systolic or diastolic dysfunction
   -Attempt to set lower minute ventilations on AC in order to not blunt
   respiratory drive.
   # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe most likley due to
   staph aureus pneumonia and likely a mucus plug.  After extubation on
   [**2113-2-5**], had increased production of sputum.   Also with leukocytosis on
   [**2113-2-6**].

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. 

The patient experienced hypercapnic respiratory failure and was initially intubated but later extubated. However, due to worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure, he required reintubation. This suggests that the patient may have difficulty maintaining adequate ventilation on his own. Possible reversible causes of respiratory failure, including pneumonia, are being treated. A tracheostomy may ultimately be required.

The patient also has pneumonia, as evidenced by increased production of sputum, leukocytosis, and collapsed left lower lobe. Antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) are being continued pending final culture results. 

The patient denies abdominal pain, and the abdominal exam is benign. Monitoring will continue for any signs of abdominal issues.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Metoprolol is being continued to manage these conditions and avoid the risks of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Chronic renal insufficiency is noted, but the creatinine level appears to be at baseline. Medications will be renally dosed, and nephrotoxins will be avoided.

Pyuria is present, but cultures only grew yeast, which is likely a contaminant. The"

   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercarbia:  This patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and continues to become hypercarbic any time he is not
   maintained on assigned rate ventilation.  There does not appear to be
   an intrinsic pulmonary process contributing to this issue and it seems
   more consistent with decreased central respiratory drive.    It seems
   unlikely sever impairment of drive is due simply to low doses of
   sedatives but no indication of other, more pernicious etiologies at
   this time.
   -Sedation off, will attempt spontaneous breathing trial when this is
   off several hours
   -Attempt to  set lower minute ventilations on AC in order to not blunt
   respiratory drive.
   # Hypoxia: Patient
s hypoxia presumably due to collapsed left lower
   lobe most likley due to staph aureus pneumonia and likely a  mucus
   plug.  This continues to appear to be improved.     Currently, he is
   well oxygenated with ventilation.  .

   prerenal [**Last Name (un) **] though possible element of ATN as well (given muddy brown
   casts) Cr stable since yesterday.
   -Given decreased edema and increased UOP yesterday will cautiously give
   1000 ml NS and follow UOP and edema.
   -Renally dose medications
    -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.
   -Change foley catheter
   #  Abdominal Pain: Patient continues to deny abdominal pain and exam
   benign.  Continue to monitor.
   # Delirium: Patient w/purposeful movements and nods/shakes head
   appropriately.  Patient is not combative or a danger to himself or to
   lines.   No signs of current delirium.
   - treat underlying potential cause of delirium (infection) and
   respiratory derangements

","The patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation and hypertension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 133/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include invasive ventilation being stopped and then restarted due to his inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels. He required reintubation after initially being extubated. The patient also had increased purulent sputum production, which was sent for culture.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
- Hypercarbia: The patient continues to become hypercarbic when not maintained on assigned rate ventilation. This is likely due to decreased central respiratory drive rather than an intrinsic pulmonary process.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with respiratory failure due to weakness, aspiration, and MRSA pneumonia. He initially improved after intubation and clearance of secretions, but later experienced hypercarbic respiratory failure and was reintubated. The patient's current conditions include aspiration pneumonia with hypercarbic respiratory failure, volume overload, leukocytosis with purulent secretions, and acute renal failure (ARF). The plan includes treating the aspiration pneumonia with Vanco/Zosyn, aspiration precautions, decreasing minute ventilation to correct respiratory alkalosis, and decreasing sedation. The patient also requires management for volume overload, leukocytosis with purulent secretions, and ARF. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further aspiration events, worsening infection, development of septic shock, worsening renal function, and potential need for dialysis. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage these conditions and prevent further complications."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 82M multifactorial respiratory failure.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.9 BP 110/70 HR 90 RR18-24 with sat 98 on VAC.
   Ill appearing man, coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft, NT + BS, large wound
   healing by secondary intention.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with transition from VAC
   to PSV while allowing pCO2 to drift up. Will check CVP and BNP as well
   as echo given concern for volume overload prior to diuresis. Will
   recheck sputum and continue with vanco and zosyn for component of
   pneumonia. Will meet with family to discuss long terms goals of care.
   Need to transition off drip sedation and place PICC. Resume TFs.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with respiratory failure in the setting of weakness and aspiration. He also has pleural effusions and atelectasis secondary to MRSA pneumonia. The patient initially improved after being intubated, cleared of secretions, and treated with appropriate antibiotics. However, he was extubated yesterday due to progressive hypercarbic failure and subsequently reintubated.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia with hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   - The patient is receiving Vancomycin and Zosyn for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia.
   - Aspiration precautions are being taken to prevent further aspiration.
   - The patient's minute ventilation is being decreased to correct respiratory alkalosis.
   - Sedation is being decreased.

2. Volume overload:
   - A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is ordered to assess the patient's cardiac function and fluid status.
   - B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are being monitored.
   - Diuretic therapy will be initiated based on the above findings.

3. Leukocytosis with purulent secretions:
   - A sputum culture has been obtained to identify any potential pathogens.
   - A pan culture will be done if there are spikes in the sputum culture.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF):
   - The patient's renal function"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with respiratory failure. The patient initially presented with weakness and aspiration, leading to pneumonia caused by MRSA. He was intubated to clear secretions, pleural effusion, and received appropriate antibiotics. After showing improvement in mental status, the patient was extubated but subsequently experienced progressive hypercarbic failure and required reintubation.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Aspiration pneumonia with hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition is already being treated with antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn), aspiration precautions, decreasing minute ventilation to correct respiratory alkalosis, and decreasing sedation.

2. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess intake of 1,014 mL and output of 1,660 mL, indicating a potential volume overload. Further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels is recommended. Diuresis may be initiated based on these results.

3. Leukocytosis with purulent secretions: The patient has leukocytosis and purulent secretions, suggesting a possible infection. Sputum culture and pan culture if spikes are indicated to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated serum creatinine level of 1.9 mg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He has a history of recent major GI bleed and prolonged hospitalization. The patient required intubation initially for hypercapnic respiratory failure but was extubated on [**2113-2-5**]. However, he needed re-intubation later that day due to worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure. There are concerns about mental status changes from continued aspiration events and pulmonary edema. The patient also has collapsed left lower lobe, likely due to staph aureus pneumonia and a mucus plug. He has leukocytosis on [**2113-2-6**]. The patient's Hct is 24, which is lower than the baseline range of 25-27. He is being treated for pneumonia, anemia, history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and pyuria. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/43 to 150/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if he does not respond to treatment or if there are further complications"

   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  This patient was initially
   intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to
   chest muscle weakness, extubated on [**2113-2-5**], but required re-intubation
   later that day for worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure.   [**Month (only) 60**] be
   exacerbated by mental status changes from likely continued aspiration
   events. Decreased central respiratory drive does not appear to be
   contributing as patient was tachypneic prior to intubation.   Will
   attempt to treat possible reversible causes of respiratory failure,
   including pneumonia, volume overload if indicated.  [**Month (only) 60**] ultimately
   require tracheostomy.
   - continue treatment of pneumonia, diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - check ECHO to rule out acute systolic or diastolic dysfunction
   -Attempt to set lower minute ventilations on AC in order to not blunt
   respiratory drive.

   staph aureus pneumonia and likely a mucus plug.  After extubation on
   [**2113-2-5**], had increased production of sputum.   Also with leukocytosis on
   [**2113-2-6**].
   -Continue vancomycin and  pipercillin/tazobactam pending final culture
   results
   -Intend for [**7-7**] day course of therapy for pneumonia, will hope to d/c
   pip-tazobactam after final respiratory cultures negative
   #  Abdominal Pain: Patient continues to deny abdominal pain and exam
   benign.  Continue to monitor.
   # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters
   in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficency:  Creatinine appears to be at baseline.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient had been previously hospitalized and required re-intubation due to worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which indicates difficulty in breathing due to excess carbon dioxide in the blood. This may be exacerbated by mental status changes from likely continued aspiration events. The patient's central respiratory drive does not appear to be contributing to the respiratory failure. Treatment options include attempting to treat possible reversible causes of respiratory failure, such as pneumonia, and considering a tracheostomy.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has collapsed left lower lobe, most likely due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and a mucus plug. After extubation, the patient had an increased production of sputum, and leukocytosis was noted on [**2113-2-6**]. Continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam pending final culture results is advised, with an intended 7-7 day course of therapy for pneumonia. 

3. Abdominal pain: The patient denies abdominal pain, and the exam is benign. Monitoring for any changes or symptoms related to abdominal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of recent major gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient initially intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely secondary to chest muscle weakness, but required re-intubation later that day due to worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient also has pneumonia with a collapsed left lower lobe, likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and a mucus plug. He has anemia with a Hct of 24 from a baseline of 25-27. The patient's chronic renal insufficiency appears to be at baseline, and he has pyuria with yeast contamination in urine culture. The patient is being treated for hypercapnic respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, and chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced hypercapnic respiratory failure, which required intubation. There is a potential for further respiratory failure due to ongoing pulmonary issues such as pneumonia or aspiration events.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
3. Aspiration: The patient's mental status changes and decreased central respiratory drive increase the risk of aspiration events, leading to further respiratory compromise.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct"

   hypercapnic respiratory failure and failed extubation due to slow
   development of hypercapnea.  Initially there was concern that this was
   heavily influenced by sedating drugs but as patient was minimally/not
   sedated during extubation failure and NIF of 14 concern for significant
   neuromuscular weakness.  This is most likely secondary to
   deconditioning, nutritional status, FTT but patient does have a history
   of non-specific neuromuscular pathology so should rule out NMS.
   -NMS consult for possible EMG to r/o secondary causes of neuromuscular
   weakness/reversibility.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient initially required intubation for hypercapnic respiratory failure but failed extubation due to the slow development of hypercapnea. There is concern for significant neuromuscular weakness, which could be secondary to deconditioning, nutritional status, failure to thrive (FTT), or non-specific neuromuscular pathology. An electromyography (EMG) consult has been requested to rule out secondary causes of neuromuscular weakness and potential reversibility. 

The patient also has collapsed the left lower lobe, likely due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and a mucus plug. He completed seven days of piperacillin/tazobactam therapy, but MRSA was cultured from the sputum. The patient will continue on vancomycin therapy for an additional three days.

The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from a baseline of 25-27% to 24. A transfusion plan has been made to maintain the hemoglobin level at less than or equal to 23%. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and metoprolol will be continued to avoid the risks of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's creatinine level has worsened from baseline, initially appearing"

   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Though the patient initially
   presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure his [**Last Name 8039**] problem during
   his stay here has been hypercarbic respiratory failure that led to
   initial intubation and then was the primary reason he needed
   re-intubation.  Multiple factors contributing factors including extreme
   sensitivity to sedating meds, muscle weakness, and possible increased
   dead space due to pneumonia and mucous plugging.  Given many days of
   therapy for pneumonia and optimization of fluid status we are reaching
   the limits of improving reversible issues.  Plan to move toward
   extubation again today.
   -SBT and check ABG
   -Extubate if not hypercapnic again and will re-intubate if fails again

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He has a history of major GI bleed, prolonged hospitalization, pneumonia, and possible increased dead space due to pneumonia and mucous plugging. The patient's initial presentation was hypoxemic respiratory failure, but he developed hypercapnic respiratory failure during his stay, leading to initial intubation and subsequent re-intubation.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercapnia is contributing to his respiratory failure. He has been intubated multiple times, and the plan is to extubate him again today, but if he becomes hypercapnic again, he will be re-intubated.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a collapsed left lower lobe, likely due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and a mucus plug. He had increased sputum production after extubation on [**2113-2-5**], and his sputum grew S. aureus. He is currently on day 9 of vancomycin therapy.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is 24 from a baseline of 25-27. He will be planned for transfusion when his Hct drops to less than or equal to 23.

4. History of atrial fibrillation and hypertension: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and myasthenic crisis changes. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide history. The patient has been receiving fentanyl boluses and propofol to relieve agitation. A neurology consult has been requested for neuromuscular studies.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate at 58 bpm with a normal sinus bradycardia rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 125/42-174/73 mmHg, respiratory rate at 15 breaths per minute with spontaneous ventilation not present, and oxygen saturation at 100% on FiO2 of 40%. The patient's weight has increased from 86.2 kg at admission to 97.5 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 668 mL and output of 1460 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -792 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 450 mL/hr, and urine output is 1260 mL since 12 AM. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show pH at 7.28, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 253 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) at 100%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 38, indicating a non-spontaneous respiratory effort.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin, with normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, and nasogastric (NG) tube. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with a sinus bradycardia rhythm. Peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Respiratory examination demonstrates symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion notes, and crackles on lung auscultation. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show trace edema bilaterally. Neurologic examination is not fully assessed due to sedation and intubation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 24.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) at 7.6 g/dL, sodium (Na+) at 112 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 3.7 mEq/L, glucose at 27 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 54 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.2 mg/dL, and lactate at 0."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Though the patient initially
   presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure his [**Last Name 8039**] problem during
   his stay here has been hypercarbic respiratory failure that led to
   initial intubation and then was the primary reason he needed
   re-intubation x2.  Multiple factors contributing factors including
   extreme sensitivity to sedating meds, muscle weakness, and possible
   increased dead space due to pneumonia and mucous plugging.  Given many
   days of therapy for pneumonia and optimization of fluid status we
   suspect we have reached the limits of improving reversible issues.
   -Plan for neuromuscular eval today then to discuss further goals of
   care with family re: desire for trach or not
    # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe most likley due to
   staph aureus pneumonia and likely a mucus plug.  After extubation on
   [**2113-2-5**], had increased production of sputum.   Sputum grew S. aureus.
   Vanco originally started [**2-1**] will be stopped today and expect it to
   self taper given current renal fxn.
    # Anemia:  Hct 22.4 from baseline of 25-27.  Will order 1 u PRBCs
   today
    # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding
   parameters in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont norvasc (started [**2-8**])
    # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5 and has
   been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with pre-renal
   failure but would have expected more improvement by now.  Somewhat
   limited in ability to hydrate due to volume status issues and desire to
   optimize pulmonary status.  Cr today 2.2 from 2.0
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology.
   - continue to monitor

- The patient is an 82-year-old man with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and anemia.
- He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia.
- The patient has been experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure, leading to initial intubation and subsequent re-intubation.
- Factors contributing to the respiratory failure include sensitivity to sedating medications, muscle weakness, and increased dead space due to pneumonia and mucous plugging.
- The patient's pneumonia is caused by Staphylococcus aureus and has resulted in a collapsed left lower lobe, likely due to a mucus plug.
- The patient's hemoglobin level is low (Hct 22.4), indicating anemia, and a unit of packed red blood cells will be ordered.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and metoprolol will be continued to avoid the risks associated with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient's kidney function has worsened from baseline, and medications will be renally dosed, avoiding nephrotoxins.
- The patient has pyuria with yeast growth in urine culture, which is likely a contaminant.
- Foley catheter placement is planned.
- The patient is receiving nutrition via tube feeding and has been well-controlled in terms of blood sugar levels.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP prevention.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Though the patient initially
   presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure his [**Last Name 8039**] problem during
   his stay here has been hypercarbic respiratory failure that led to
   initial intubation and then was the primary reason he needed
   re-intubation.  Multiple factors contributing factors including extreme
   sensitivity to sedating meds, muscle weakness, and possible increased
   dead space due to pneumonia and mucous plugging.  Given many days of
   therapy for pneumonia and optimization of fluid status we are reaching
   the limits of improving reversible issues.  Plan to move toward
   extubation again today.
   -SBT and check ABG
   -Extubate if not hypercapnic again and will re-intubate if fails again
    # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe most likley due to
   staph aureus pneumonia and likely a mucus plug.  After extubation on
   [**2113-2-5**], had increased production of sputum.   Sputum grew S. aureus.
   -Intend for 14 days of vancomycin therapy (currently on day 9)
    # Anemia:  Hct 24 from baseline of 25-27.  Will plan to transfuse for
   less than or eequal than 23.
   -guiac ostomy output
    # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding
   parameters in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
    # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5 and has
   been since presentation.  Initially appeard consistent with pre-renal
   failure but would have expected more improvement by now.  Somewhat
   limited in ability to hydrate due to volume status issues and desire to
   optimize pulmonary status.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology.
   - continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure but developed hypercapnic respiratory failure during his stay, leading to initial intubation and subsequent re-intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and is currently on vancomycin therapy. His hemoglobin levels have decreased from a baseline of 25-27 to 24, indicating anemia. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension is being managed with metoprolol. His kidney function has worsened since admission, and efforts are being made to optimize pulmonary status while avoiding nephrotoxins. The patient also has pyuria, which is suspected to be caused by a yeast contaminant, and a Foley catheter has been placed. He is scheduled to receive tube feeds and will continue with prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   82 y/o with h/o GI bleed s/p colectomy/respiratory failure/prolonged
   ICU course (5 mo), PE, CVA a/w UTI then tx for hypoxia, tachycardia,
   and altered mental status.  LLL dense infiltrate on CT with RML/LLL
   collapse.  Bronch showed extrinsic compression of LLL/RML bronchi with
   bronchomalacia and thick secretions. Radiology believes airway
   narrowing more likely malacia and collapse than mass/LAD.  On vanc, s/p
   zosyn x 8 days.  Progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, so
   intubated ([**2-1**]).  Thick secretions. Did well over weekend and extubated
   ([**2-6**]) - progressive hypercarbic failure so reintubated ([**2-7**]) likely
   due to mental status/weakness.  TTE negative and BNP 5000, so not
   actively diuresing.  ARF, creatinine stabilized. Very traumatic foley
   placement ([**2-6**]) with hematuria s/p cystoscopy.  Extubated ([**2-9**]) and

   care with family re: desire for trach or not
    # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe most likley due to
   staph aureus pneumonia and likely a mucus plug.  After extubation on
   [**2113-2-5**], had increased production of sputum.   Sputum grew S. aureus.
   Vanco originally started [**2-1**] will be stopped today and expect it to
   self taper given current renal fxn.
    # Anemia:  Hct 22.4 from baseline of 25-27.  Will order 1 u PRBCs
   today
    # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding
   parameters in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont norvasc (started [**2-8**])
    # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5 and has
   been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with pre-renal
   failure but would have expected more improvement by now.  Somewhat
   limited in ability to hydrate due to volume status issues and desire to
   optimize pulmonary status.  Cr today 2.2 from 2.0
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident with urinary tract infection, and treatment for hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple factors including hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, chronic kidney disease, pyuria, and nutritional support.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to adequately ventilate and remove carbon dioxide from the blood can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent complications such as increased intracranial pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, and muscle weakness.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's collapsed left lower lobe and production of sputum indicate a possible staphylococcus aureus infection. If left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of the lung, leading to worsening pneumonia and potentially causing sepsis.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level of 22.4% is below the normal range. Severe anemia can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, resulting in fatigue, weakness, and increased susceptibility to infections.

4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. CKD can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man s/p prolonged hospital course due to GI bleed, now
   represented with hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Now s/p 2 failed
   extubations.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Likely due to neuromuscular
   weakness c/b PNA and effusions.  Has failed 2 trials of extubation, so
   now the decision will need to be made by family regarding withdrawal of
   care vs trach/peg.
   - Turn off propofol
   - Fentanyl boluses prn
   - PS later today if tolerated
   - Discuss trach/peg with family.
   - Continue vanc for MRSA PNA.
   # Anemia:  s/p PRBC
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Creatinine slowly coming down.
   -Renally dose medications
   -Avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   - Continue to follow
   All other issues per resident note.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man s/p prolonged hospital course due to GI bleed, now
   represented with hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Now s/p 2 failed
   extubations.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Likely due to neuromuscular
   weakness c/b PNA and effusions.  Has failed 2 trials of extubation, so
   now the decision will need to be made by family regarding withdrawal of
   care vs trach/peg.
   - Turn off propofol
   - Fentanyl boluses prn
   - PS later today if tolerated
   - Discuss trach/peg with family.
   - Continue vanc for MRSA PNA.
   # Anemia:  s/p PRBC
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Creatinine slowly coming down.
   -Renally dose medications
   -Avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   - Continue to follow

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Though the patient initially
   presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure his [**Last Name 8039**] problem during
   his stay here has been hypercarbic respiratory failure that led to
   initial intubation and then was the primary reason he needed
   re-intubation x2.  Possible contribution of sedating meds intially but
   has failed when not under influence of these.  Most likely due to
   general neuromuscular weakness (supported by EMG) due to chronic
   illness and/ or malnutrition.
   -only possible route to recovery is prolonged pulmonary rehab and
   placement with trach, patient seems to be indicating he does not want
   but difficult to assess given only able to write short sentences
   -Family meeting to discuss progress and alternatives
   -Trach vs presumably terminal extubation
    # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe most likley due to
   staph aureus pneumonia and likely a mucus plug.  After extubation on
   [**2113-2-5**], had increased production of sputum.   Sputum grew S. aureus.
   Vanco originally started [**2-1**] and will be continued through [**2113-2-15**] (14
   day course given degree of illness).  Currently self tapering.
   -recheck level in AM
   -dose if <= 20
     -# Anemia:  Hct 25.1 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
    # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding
   parameters in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont norvasc (started [**2-8**])
    # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5 and has
   been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with pre-renal
   failure and after some slow improvement has started to improve again
   consisten with pre-renal failure.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.

","Summary:
- The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of major gastrointestinal bleeding, prolonged hospitalization, agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia.
- He presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure but developed hypercarbic respiratory failure during his stay, leading to intubation and re-intubation twice.
- The cause of the hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely neuromuscular weakness due to chronic illness and/or malnutrition.
- The patient has a collapsed left lower lobe likely due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and a mucus plug.
- He has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 25.1, which is near baseline levels.
- The patient has worsening chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 1.8.
- He also has pyuria, but the urine culture only grew yeast, which is likely a contaminant.
- The patient is receiving tube feeds through a nasogastric tube and has an arterial line and central venous line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a collapsed left lower lobe, which is suggestive of pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially worsen his current respiratory failure.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to adequately ventilate and clear carbon dioxide can lead to respiratory acidosis, which can have serious consequences on multiple organ systems.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease:"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Though the patient initially
   presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure his [**Last Name 8039**] problem during
   his stay here has been hypercarbic respiratory failure that led to
   initial intubation and then was the primary reason he needed
   re-intubation x2.  Multiple factors contributing factors including
   extreme sensitivity to sedating meds, muscle weakness, and possible
   increased dead space due to pneumonia and mucous plugging.  Given many
   days of therapy for pneumonia and optimization of fluid status we
   suspect we have reached the limits of improving reversible issues.
   -Plan for neuromuscular eval today then to discuss further goals of
   care with family re: desire for trach or not
    # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe most likley due to
   staph aureus pneumonia and likely a mucus plug.  After extubation on
   [**2113-2-5**], had increased production of sputum.   Sputum grew S. aureus.
   Vanco originally started [**2-1**] will be stopped today and expect it to
   self taper given current renal fxn.
    # Anemia:  Hct 22.4 from baseline of 25-27.  Will order 1 u PRBCs
   today
    # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding
   parameters in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont norvasc (started [**2-8**])
    # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5 and has
   been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with pre-renal
   failure but would have expected more improvement by now.  Somewhat
   limited in ability to hydrate due to volume status issues and desire to
   optimize pulmonary status.  Cr today 2.2 from 2.0
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology.
   - continue to monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with recent major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has been diagnosed with hypercapnic respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and pyuria.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to hypercapnia. This condition can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further hypoxia and potential organ damage.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has collapsed left lower lobe pneumonia most likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus. This infection needs to be addressed promptly to prevent the spread and worsening of the infection.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is below the normal range, indicating anemia. This condition can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and may contribute to fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms.

4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have worsened since admission, suggesting a decline in kidney function. CKD can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

5. Pyuria: Although the urine culture only grew yeast, which is likely a contaminant, the presence of leukocyte esterase and pyuria indicates an"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man who has had a prolonged hospital course due to a gastrointestinal bleed. He is currently represented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely caused by neuromuscular weakness resulting from pneumonia and effusions. The patient has failed two trials of extubation, so a decision needs to be made by the family regarding the withdrawal of care or tracheostomy/peg tube placement. The patient also has anemia and chronic kidney disease, for which medications are being renally dosed and nephrotoxins are being avoided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation increases the risk of further respiratory complications, such as hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has failed two extubation attempts, which increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are slowly coming down, indicating potential improvement in kidney function. However, careful monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function, especially considering the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Anemia: The patient has received packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to address his anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the transfusion and prevent further complications related to low oxygen-c"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old individual with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident with urinary tract infection, and treatment for hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient was previously intubated due to progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, but was successfully extubated on [**2-6**]. However, the patient's condition worsened, leading to reintubation on [**2-7**]. The patient was extubated again on [**2-9**] but required another reintubation later that day.

The patient has chronic polyneuropathy and ongoing discussions regarding the possibility of a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's primary issues include hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely caused by neuromuscular weakness resulting from pneumonia and effusions. The patient has failed two trials of extubation, and the decision regarding withdrawal of care versus tracheostomy/PEG needs to be made by the family.

Other medical conditions include anemia, which has been managed with packed red blood cells (PRBC), and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with creatinine levels slowly coming down. Renal dose medications are being administered, and nephrotoxins are being avoided. 

The patient is receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN at a rate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been admitted multiple times and has had several complications including reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and neuromuscular weakness. The patient's condition is critical, and there are ongoing discussions regarding the placement of a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient has expressed his wishes to be extubated and not trached, indicating that he does not want any further prolongation of his life.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's repeated episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate difficulty in adequately ventilating and removing carbon dioxide from the bloodstream. This could be due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions.
2. Tracheostomy vs. extubation: The patient's condition requires careful consideration of whether to perform a tracheostomy or allow for extubation. If the patient continues to fail extubation attempts, tracheostomy may be necessary for long-term airway management.
3. Chronic polyneuropathy: The patient has been evaluated for chronic polyneuropathy, which may contribute to his respiratory difficulties and overall weakness.
4. Anemia: The patient has received packed red blood cells"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o with h/o GI bleed s/p colectomy/respiratory failure/prolonged
   ICU course (5 mo), PE, CVA a/w UTI then tx for hypoxia, tachycardia,
   and altered mental status.  Progressive hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, so intubated ([**2-1**]).  Thick secretions. Did well and extubated
   ([**2-6**]) - progressive hypercarbic failure so reintubated ([**2-7**]) likely
   due to mental status/weakness.  Extubated ([**2-9**]) and reintubated later
   that day
 neuromuscular eval c/w chronic polyneuropathy.  Ongoing
   discussions regarding trach/peg.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Likely due to neuromuscular
   weakness c/b PNA and effusions.  Has failed 2 trials of extubation, so
   now the decision will need to be made by family regarding withdrawal of
   care vs trach/peg.
   - Fentanyl boluses prn
   - PS as tolerated
   - Discuss trach/peg with family today.
   - Continue vanc for MRSA PNA x 14 days.
   # Anemia:  s/p PRBC
   - Hct stable. Will follow
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Creatinine slowly coming down.
   -Renally dose medications
   -Avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   - Continue to follow
   #Code status: Patient expressed his wishes this am to be extubated and
   not trached.  When explained that he may not be able to breath without
   a trach, he wrote the word
dead
 and confirmed that he does not want
   any further prolongation.  We will call the children today and express
   to them the wishes the patient has made clear to us.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleed, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident with urinary tract infection, hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to multiple intubations and extubations. He has a chronic polyneuropathy and ongoing discussions regarding the placement of a tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: This is already present in the patient due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. The patient has failed two trials of extubation, indicating the severity of the respiratory failure.

2. Tracheostomy or PEG placement: The patient's decision to be extubated and not trached may lead to further respiratory complications if the tracheostomy or PEG is not performed. This could result in difficulty breathing without mechanical ventilation support.

3. Anemia: The patient has received packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has a stable hematocrit level. Monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin and oxygenation is crucial to prevent further complications related to anemia.

4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are slowly coming down"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Though the patient initially
   presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure his [**Last Name 8039**] problem during
   his stay here has been hypercarbic respiratory failure that led to
   initial intubation and then was the primary reason he needed
   re-intubation x2.  Possible contribution of sedating meds intially but
   has failed when not under influence of these.  Most likely due to
   general neuromuscular weakness (supported by EMG) due to chronic
   illness and/ or malnutrition.
   -only possible route to recovery is prolonged pulmonary rehab and
   placement with trach, patient seems to be indicating he does not want
   but difficult to assess given only able to write short sentences
   -Family meeting to discuss progress and alternatives
   -Trach vs presumably terminal extubation
   # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe most likley due to
   staph aureus pneumonia and likely a mucus plug.  After extubation on
   [**2113-2-5**], had increased production of sputum.   Sputum grew S. aureus.
   Vanco originally started [**2-1**] and will be continued through [**2113-2-15**] (14
   day course given degree of illness).  Currently self tapering.
   -recheck level in AM
   -dose if <= 20
   # Anemia:  Hct 25.1 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
   # History of Afib/HTN: Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters
   in order to avoid risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont norvasc (started [**2-8**])
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5 and has
   been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with pre-renal
   failure and after some slow improvement has started to improve again
   consisten with pre-renal failure.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.
   - continue to monitor
    # FEN: NG placed, cont tube feeds
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation and hypertension, chronic kidney disease, anemia, pneumonia, and pyuria.

The patient's current condition shows that he is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy planned early next week. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 171/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan section of the note highlights several issues. The patient has hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely due to neuromuscular weakness from chronic illness and malnutrition. The patient requires prolonged pulmonary rehabilitation and may need a tracheostomy, despite initial reluctance. The patient also has pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, for which vancomycin has been initiated. Anemia is present with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension should be managed with appropriate medications. There"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Though the patient initially
   presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure his [**Last Name 8039**] problem during
   his stay here has been hypercarbic respiratory failure that led to
   initial intubation and then was the primary reason he needed
   re-intubation x2 (Intubated first on [**2-1**]; extubated unsuccessfully on
   [**2-5**] and [**2-9**]).  Possible contribution of sedating meds intially but has
   failed when not under influence of these.  Most likely due to general
   neuromuscular weakness (supported by EMG) due to chronic illness and/
   or malnutrition.
   -will need trach and pulmonary rehab
   -surgery c/s tomorrow but will send fyi page today
   -Family meeting to discuss progress and alternatives
   -Trach vs presumably terminal extubation
   # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  Vanco originally started [**2-1**]
   and will be continued through [**2113-2-14**] (14 day course given degree of
   illness).
   -will self-taper vanc and complete 14 day course tomorrow
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.  A-line BP reads higher
   measurement than manual cuff.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  norvasc (started [**2-8**])
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5 and has

   failure and after some slow improvement has started to improve again
   consisten with pre-renal failure.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   # Anemia:  Hct 25.1 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure but has developed hypercapnic respiratory failure, leading to repeated intubations. This may be due to general neuromuscular weakness or malnutrition.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph aureus pneumonia and likely mucus plug. Antibiotic treatment with vancomycin has been initiated and will be continued for a 14-day course.
3. History of atrial fibrillation (Afib) and hypertension (HTN): The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has a history of stroke. The blood pressure readings show higher measurements in the arterial line compared to the manual cuff.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have worsened from baseline and indicate pre-renal failure. Renal dose medications should be adjusted, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is near baseline, indicating anemia. Further evaluation and management are required.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He has a history of major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure but has now developed hypercapnic respiratory failure, which has led to two previous intubations. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and likely mucus plug. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, chronic kidney disease, anemia, pyuria (yeast contamination), and feeding tube placement.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, worsening of chronic kidney disease, development of further infections, and complications related to the feeding tube.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, and nutritional intake. Regular assessments of blood gases, electrolytes, and kidney function tests should be performed. Infection control measures should be maintained, and the patient's feeding tube should be monitored for any complications such as aspiration or blockage.

Given the patient's age and comorbidities, a multidisciplinary approach involving ICU specialists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, and nutritionists should be considered to manage his complex medical conditions effectively."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. He was previously extubated twice but required reintubation due to progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely caused by neuromuscular weakness secondary to pneumonia and effusions. The patient and family have decided on tracheostomy as the next course of action.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation may lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient is currently on day 13/14 of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. There is a risk of developing new infections or resistant organisms due to prolonged antibiotic use.
3. Anemia: The patient received packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but has stable hematocrit levels. Monitoring of blood counts is necessary to ensure adequate oxygen delivery.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are slowly decreasing. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are important to prevent further kidney damage.
5. Neuromuscular weakness: The patient's chronic polyneuropathy may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure and weakness, potentially leading to complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and immobility-related issues.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been admitted multiple times with hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. He was initially intubated due to progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure but was later extubated and reintubated. The patient has chronic polyneuropathy and has failed two trials of extubation. The family has decided that the patient wants to be trached. The patient's current medical conditions include hypercapnic respiratory failure, anemia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation may lead to further respiratory compromise, potentially resulting in hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tissue perfusion.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are slowly coming down, indicating some improvement. However, CKD can progress and lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
4. Tracheostomy: If the family decides to proceed with tracheostomy, there are potential complications associated with the procedure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has been intubated twice due to hypercapnic respiratory failure, which is likely caused by general neuromuscular weakness from polyneuropathy due to chronic illness and/or malnutrition. The patient also has pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and is being treated with vancomycin. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, but is currently in normal sinus rhythm and not anticoagulated. The patient's kidney function has worsened from baseline creatinine levels, suggesting acute kidney injury, possibly due to pre-renal failure. He also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL. There is evidence of pyuria, but cultures only grew yeast, indicating contamination. The patient has a nasogastric tube and is receiving tube feeds. He is also receiving prophylactic heparin and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate ventilation can lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, causing respiratory acidosis and potential organ damage.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus can progress to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted with progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, intubated, and later extubated but required reintubation due to mental status/weakness. The patient has chronic polyneuropathy and has failed two trials of extubation. The family has decided that the patient wants to be trached. The patient's current issues include hypercapnic respiratory failure, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: This condition is likely due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. The patient has already failed two trials of extubation, and the decision between withdrawal of care vs tracheostomy/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) needs to be made by the family.

2. Anemia: The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to address the anemia. The hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and further management will be based on the Hct levels.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are slowly coming down. Renal dosing of medications, avoidance of nephrotoxins (such as IV"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident. He was admitted due to hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely caused by neuromuscular weakness secondary to pneumonia and effusions. He has failed two trials of extubation, so the decision regarding withdrawal of care or tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) needs to be made by the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. This condition can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which can result in confusion, decreased consciousness, and even cardiac arrest if not promptly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. If the infection persists or new infections occur, it can worsen the patient's condition and potentially lead to sepsis.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are slowly coming down, indicating some improvement in kidney function. However, CKD can have long-term complications such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased risk of infections.
4. Anemia: The patient received packed red blood"

   There was a questionable contribution of sedating meds to his initial
   hypventilatory failure but .  Most likely due to general neuromuscular
   weakness chronic illness and/ or malnutrition.
   -will need trach and pulmonary rehab
   # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a  14 day
   course of vancomycin for this.
   #Pulmonary edema: Patient with bilateral pulmonary edema on chest
   radiograph and trace lower extremity edema.  We will attempt gentle
   diuresis today after his trach placement.  If poor response to bolus
   furosemide would consider albumin to pull fluid intravascular prior to
   further boluses due to assumed low colloid pressure.
   -Goal I/O is -500-1000ml
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.  A-line BP reads higher
   measurement than manual cuff.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.

   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   # Anemia:  Hct 25.3 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture

- He has been intubated twice and failed extubation on two occasions.
- The patient has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for staph aureus pneumonia.
- He also has bilateral pulmonary edema and trace lower extremity edema.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, currently in normal sinus rhythm.
- His renal function has worsened from baseline creatinine of 1.4-1.5.
- The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 25.3.
- He has pyuria with yeast growth in urine culture, likely a contaminant.
- The patient is on a Dobhoff tube for enteral nutrition and continues tube feeding.
- He is also on heparin subcutaneously for prophylaxis and a proton pump inhibitor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to adequately ventilate can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which can result in respiratory acidosis and subsequent organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph aureus"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of recent major gastrointestinal bleed, prolonged hospitalization, and previous admissions for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pneumonia.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, specifically hypercapnic respiratory failure, which has required intubation twice. The primary cause of this failure is believed to be general neuromuscular weakness due to chronic illness and malnutrition. The patient will need a tracheostomy and pulmonary rehabilitation.

Additionally, the patient has pneumonia caused by staphylococcus aureus and likely mucus plug. Vancomycin was started on 2/1 and will be continued until 2/14, after which the patient will self-taper and complete a 14-day course.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, currently in normal sinus rhythm. He is not anticoagulated per patient choice, despite having a history of stroke. His blood pressure readings show higher measurements with the arterial line compared to the manual cuff. It is recommended to continue metoprolol with good holding parameters to avoid risks of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's kidney function has worsened from baseline creatinine levels of 1.4-1.5 and has been since presentation. Initially, it appeared consistent with pre-renal failure, but there has"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident with urinary tract infection, and treatment for hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure and neuromuscular weakness caused by polyneuropathy. The patient and family have decided on tracheostomy. The patient is being treated for hypercapnic respiratory failure, anemia, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, and feeding issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to being intubated and having a weakened immune system.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and other factors increase the risk of blood clots, which can lead to DVT and potentially PE.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of developing infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or wound infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been admitted multiple times and has undergone various interventions. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently intubated due to progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely caused by neuromuscular weakness secondary to pneumonia and effusions. The patient and his family have decided that he should be tracheostomized. The patient has failed two trials of extubation, so tracheostomy is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. This can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood and subsequent respiratory acidosis. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Tracheostomy: The patient is scheduled to undergo tracheostomy due to failed extubation attempts. Tracheostomy carries its own risks, including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, and damage to the trachea or surrounding structures. Careful technique and postoperative monitoring are crucial.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Blood transfusions may be required to address this issue. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and symptoms of an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, urinary tract infection, and hypoxia. The patient has been admitted multiple times and has undergone a colectomy. The patient has been experiencing progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to multiple intubations and extubations. The patient's mental status and weakness are likely contributing to the respiratory failure. A neuromuscular evaluation revealed chronic polyneuropathy, and the patient and family have decided on tracheostomy. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has failed two trials of extubation. The medical team is considering withdrawal of care versus tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: Due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions.
2. Tracheostomy: There is a risk of bleeding, infection, or damage to structures in the neck during the procedure.
3. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient may develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated lung injury, or muscle weakness.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are slowly decreasing, indicating improvement, but there is still a risk of further kidney damage.
5. Anemia: The patient has received packed red blood cells"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. He was previously extubated but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and neuromuscular weakness. The patient and family have decided to proceed with a tracheostomy. The patient's current condition includes hypercapnic respiratory failure, anemia, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, and feeding issues. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including sedation, pain management, diuretics, blood transfusions, and renal dose medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Fluid balance shows an overall negative balance, indicating fluid loss. Laboratory results indicate some abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and liver function tests. The patient's neurological exam reveals attentive behavior and ability to follow simple commands. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is planned for a tracheostomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated multiple times, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls should be implemented to prevent VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. He has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for staphylococcus pneumonia and trace lower extremity edema. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 179/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight has increased from 86.2 kg at admission to 97.5 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal limits. The patient has an Hct of 25.3% and a platelet count of 296 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which led to initial intubation and subsequent failed extubation attempts. This may require tracheostomy and pulmonary rehabilitation.

2. Pneumonia: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with recent major gastrointestinal bleeding who is admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation and hypertension. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure but has since developed hypercapnic respiratory failure. This is the primary reason for his initial intubation and subsequent failed extubation attempts. The patient requires a tracheostomy and pulmonary rehabilitation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a collapsed left lower lobe secondary to Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug. The patient has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for this.

3. Pulmonary edema: The patient exhibits bilateral pulmonary edema on chest radiograph and trace lower extremity edema. Gentle diuresis will be attempted today after tracheostomy placement. If there is a poor response to bolus furosemide, albumin may be considered to pull fluid intravascular prior to further boluses due to assumed low colloid pressure. The goal is to achieve an input/output balance of -500 to 1000 mL.

4. History of atrial fibrillation/ hypertension: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm and not anticoagulated per"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident associated with urinary tract infection. The patient has been experiencing progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness, possibly caused by pneumonia and pleural effusions. Despite two previous attempts at extubation, the patient has failed and will now undergo tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and pleural effusions. This condition can lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, resulting in confusion, drowsiness, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is characterized by an altered mental state, confusion, and agitation. Delirium can increase the risk of complications such as falls, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pressure ulcers.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. If left untreated, it may worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of complications during surgery or other medical procedures.

4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has CKD, indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Poorly controlled CKD can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident with subsequent urinary tract infection. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. The patient has failed two trials of extubation and has decided to undergo tracheostomy. Other issues include delirium, anemia, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, and feeding difficulties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: This condition can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness, headache, and even loss of consciousness.
2. Neuromuscular weakness: The patient's chronic polyneuropathy and prolonged ICU stay may contribute to muscle weakness, which can affect breathing and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of MRSA pneumonia increases the risk of complications such as sepsis or multi-drug resistant infection.
4. Delirium: Delirium can progress to severe confusion, agitation, and increased risk of falls or other accidents.
5. Anemia: Severe anemia can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Chronic kidney disease: Progressive kidney dysfunction may result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances,"

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident associated with urinary tract infection. The patient had previously undergone a colectomy and was admitted with hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. He was initially intubated due to progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, but was successfully extubated on day 6. However, he experienced another episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure and was reintubated. On day 9, he was extubated again but was reintubated later that day.

The patient's medical conditions include anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation with hypertension, and femoral neck fracture. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen. His vital signs include a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has shown improvements in his laboratory values, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, and glucose levels. However, his potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels remain within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal bilateral lower lung field airspace disease with effusions, which is slightly improving.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a pressure support of 5 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Imaging reveals bilateral lower lung field airspace disease with effusions, which is slightly improving. The patient is being managed with antibiotics, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and systemic anticoagulation. The patient's code status is set to full code, and the current disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be implemented.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is already in"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Low NIF
s and recurrently
   ventilatory failure soon after extubation with other etiologies
   excluded seems to suggest primary muscle weakness (EEG performed to
   rule out secondary causes).  Patient has been trached due to need for
   prolonged ventilatory support  and will go to rehab for further
   pulmonary rehab.
   -check ABG now and after transition to trach mass
   # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a 14
   day course of vancomycin for this.
   - continue to follow
   #Pulmonary edema: Patient has had pulmonary edema previously and
   continues to have trace lower extremity edema.  We will attempt gentle
   diuresis today.  If poor response to bolus furosemide would consider
   albumin to pull fluid intravascular prior to further boluses due to
   assumed low colloid pressure.
   -Goal I/O is -euvolemic
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.  A-line BP reads higher
   measurement than manual cuff.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  norvasc (started [**2-8**])
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is mildly worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5
   and has been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with
   pre-renal failure and worsening now a bit with diuresis.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   # Arterial line erythema:  Will send blood cultures (though patient
   afebrile) from A line and IJ and plan to place peripherals, eventually
   pull IJ, and pull A-line tomorrow after checking ABG on trach.
   -take ABG on PS and trach mask  then pull A-line
   -One more dose of prophylactic vancomycin
   # Anemia:  Hct 25.8 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.
   - continue to monitor
   # FEN: Dobhoff placed, continue tube foods
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI
   # Communication: W/ [**Name (NI) 2856**], HCP.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient experienced recurrent ventilatory failure after extubation, which suggests primary muscle weakness. An EEG was performed to rule out secondary causes.

2. Pneumonia: The patient developed a collapsed left lower lobe secondary to Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug. He has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for this.

3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has had previous episodes of pulmonary edema and continues to have trace lower extremity edema. Gentle diuresis will be attempted today.

4. History of atrial fibrillation (Afib) and hypertension (HTN): The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Although the patient has a history of stroke, they are not anticoagulated per their choice. There is a discrepancy between the arterial line blood pressure readings and the manual cuff readings.

5. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have worsened from baseline, initially appearing consistent with pre-renal failure and now showing signs of worsening with diuresis. Renal dosing of medications will be necessary, and nephrotoxins should be"

","The patient is a 71-inch tall, 97.5 kg male who is currently in the ICU with hypoxia and pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes tracheostomy, granulation tissue, and tracheal stenosis from a prior tracheostomy. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.

In the 24-hour period, the patient had a blood culture drawn at 11:12 AM and subsequently underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy at 2:30 PM due to granulation tissue and tracheal stenosis from a prior tracheostomy. The patient became agitated after the procedure and was given 25 fentanyl by the doctor at the request of the nurse. Additionally, Vancomycin was administered for line prophylaxis, and the level will be checked in the morning with plans for redosing if needed. The patient's IV team could not place peripheral IVs and will try again tomorrow.

The patient's current infusions include pantoprazole, midazolam, vecuronium, propofol, fentanyl, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications administered include Vancomycin and fibersource HN (full) nutrition at a rate of 65 mL/hour.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms related to pneumonia and aspiration. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F),"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Though the patient initially
   presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure his [**Last Name 8039**] problem during
   his stay here has been hypercarbic respiratory failure that led to
   initial intubation and then was the primary reason he failed extubation
   x2 (Intubated first on [**2-1**]; extubated unsuccessfully on [**2-5**] and [**2-9**]).
   There was a questionable contribution of sedating meds to his initial
   hypventilatory failure but most likely due to general neuromuscular
   weakness (polyneuropathy documented), chronic illness and/ or
   malnutrition.
   -will need trach and pulmonary rehab
   # Pneumonia: Patient has collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a 14
   day course of vancomycin for this.
   - continue to follow
   #Pulmonary edema: Patient with bilateral pulmonary edema on chest
   radiograph and trace lower extremity edema.  We will attempt gentle
   diuresis today after his trach placement.  If poor response to bolus
   furosemide would consider albumin to pull fluid intravascular prior to
   further boluses due to assumed low colloid pressure.
   -Goal I/O is -500-1000ml
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.  A-line BP reads higher
   measurement than manual cuff.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  norvasc (started [**2-8**])
   -Patient currently somewhat agitated due to tube and awareness, after
   ET tube removed will  reevaluate need for further anti-hypertensives
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is mildly worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5
   and has been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with
   pre-renal failure and after some slow improvement has started to
   improve again consistent with pre-renal failure.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   # Arterial line erythema:  Will send blood cultures (though patient
   afebrile) from A line and IJ and plan to place peripherals, eventually
   pull IJ, and pull A-line tomorrow after checking ABG on trach.
   # Anemia:  Hct 25.8 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.
   - continue to monitor
   # FEN: Dobhoff placed, continue tube foods
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI
   # Communication: W/ [**Name (NI) 2856**], HCP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of recent major gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure initially but then developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, leading to intubation and subsequent extubation attempts that were unsuccessful. The patient also has pneumonia caused by MRSA and mucus plug in the left lower lobe, for which he completed a 14-day course of vancomycin. Additionally, he has pulmonary edema, trace lower extremity edema, and is at risk for further fluid overload. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. His kidney function is mildly worsened from baseline, showing an increase in creatinine levels. The patient has erythema around the arterial line site, and blood cultures have been sent. He also has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 25.8, which is near his baseline range. The patient's urinary analysis showed leukocyte esterase and pyuria, but the urine culture only grew yeast, suggesting contamination. A coude foley catheter was placed on [**2113-2-7**] and will not be changed at this time. The patient requires tracheostomy and pulmonary rehabilitation. His blood pressure readings are higher on the arterial line compared to manual cuff"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident. The patient has been experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone multiple intubations and extubations. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is scheduled to undergo tracheostomy. The patient's medical conditions include hypercapnic respiratory failure, delirium, anemia, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, and feeding difficulties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of the bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring respiratory secretions.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, including the use of compression stockings and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be implemented.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at increased risk for stress ulcers. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors should be continued to prevent gastric ulcers.
4. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes and agitation may be indicative of delirium. It is important to monitor the patient closely and manage any underlying causes such as infection or medication"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. The patient was previously extubated twice but had to be reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and neuromuscular weakness. He is currently on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. The patient has chronic polyneuropathy and has decided to undergo tracheostomy. His current issues include hypercapnic respiratory failure, delirium, anemia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular assessment of sputum culture are necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous heparin should be continued.
3. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged pressure on certain body areas can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessment and repositioning are important to prevent pressure ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. Regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any potential infections.
5. Delirium: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Low NIF
s and recurrently
   ventilatory failure soon after extubation with other etiologies
   excluded seems to suggest primary muscle weakness (EEG performed to
   rule out secondary causes).  Patient has been trached due to need for
   prolonged ventilatory support  and will go to rehab for further
   pulmonary rehab.
    # Pneumonia: Patient had collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a 14
   day course of vancomycin for this.  No fevers or chills.
    #Pulmonary edema: Patient has had pulmonary edema previously and
   continues to have trace lower extremity edema.  We will continue to
   monitor respiratory status and attempt gentle diuresis as tolerated.
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  amlodipine (started [**2-8**])
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is mildly worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5
   and has been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with
   pre-renal failure and improved with hydration (Cr down to 1.5) but has
   mildly worsened with attempted diuresis.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   -Hold off on further active diuresis for now as long as patient not
   grossly fluid positive
   # Arterial line erythema:  A-line removed and cultures remained
   negative.  Patient did receive two doses of cautionary vancomycin.
    # Anemia:  Hct 24.4 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
    #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.
   - continue to monitor
   # FEN: Dobhoff placed, continue tube foods
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI

","The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He has a history of major GI bleed and prolonged hospitalization. The patient was transferred from the floor due to recurrent ventilatory failure soon after extubation, suggesting primary muscle weakness. An EEG was performed to rule out secondary causes. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with FiO2 50%. His arterial blood gas shows pH 7.40, PaCO2 52, PaO2 90, and HCO3- 32. 

The patient's past medical history includes pneumonia caused by MRSA, for which he received a 14-day course of vancomycin. He also has a history of pulmonary edema, for which diuretics are being used cautiously. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. 

Other assessments and plans include worsening kidney function, possibly due to pre-renal failure initially but now showing signs of worsening with attempted diuresis. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended. Anemia is present with a Hct of 24.4, and pyuria is also noted, most likely due to a yeast contaminant in the urine culture. 

The patient's nutrition is being managed through tube feeding, and prophylaxis measures include DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Low NIF
s and recurrently
   ventilatory failure soon after extubation with other etiologies
   excluded seems to suggest primary muscle weakness (EEG performed to
   rule out secondary causes).  Patient has been trached due to need for
   prolonged ventilatory support  and will go to rehab for further
   pulmonary rehab.
    # Pneumonia: Patient had collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a 14
   day course of vancomycin for this.  No fevers, chills, or signs of
   active infection.
    #Pulmonary edema: Patient has had pulmonary edema previously and
   continues to have trace lower extremity edema.  We will continue to
   monitor respiratory status and attempt gentle diuresis as tolerated.
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  amlodipine (started [**2-8**])
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is mildly worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5
   and has been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with
   pre-renal failure and improved with hydration (Cr down to 1.5) but has
   mildly worsened with attempted diuresis.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   -10 mg furosemide IV *1 in order to attempt to remedy persistent lower
   extremity edema
   # Arterial line erythema:  A-line removed and cultures remained
   negative.  Patient did receive two doses of cautionary vancomycin.
    # Anemia:  Hct 24.4 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
    #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.
   - continue to monitor
   # FEN: Dobhoff placed, continue tubefeeds
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of recent major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has been diagnosed with hypercapnic respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, arterial line erythema, anemia, and pyuria. He requires prolonged ventilatory support and will undergo pulmonary rehabilitation. The patient's conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, arterial line erythema, anemia, and pyuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilatory support: The patient requires prolonged ventilatory support due to primary muscle weakness. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient has low respiratory muscle strength leading to recurrent ventilatory failure. This condition can progress to severe hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis, and subsequent complications such as confusion, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Pneumonia: The patient previously had collapsed left lower lobe secondary to Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrent pneumonia due to immobility, tracheostomy, and prolonged ICU stay.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident associated with urinary tract infection, treatment for hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has had multiple episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring multiple intubations and extubations.

The patient's current condition includes chronic polyneuropathy, tracheostomy, delirium, anemia treated with packed red blood cells (PRBC), and renal issues with increased creatinine. The patient is currently receiving several medications including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and fentanyl boluses as needed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/64 mmHg to 153/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is described as attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolyte levels. However, the patient has elevated levels of lactic acid and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

","The patient is an 82-year-old man with recent major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization, admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for this. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. He is not anticoagulated despite his history of stroke. 

The patient has pulmonary edema, trace lower extremity edema, and worsening mild chronic kidney disease (CKD). His creatinine level has been between 1.4-1.7 since presentation. Initially, it improved with hydration but then worsened with attempted diuresis. Renal dose medications should be continued, and nephrotoxins should be avoided. 

The patient had erythema around an arterial line, but cultures remained negative. He received two doses of cautionary vancomycin. The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 7.7 g/dL, near his baseline of 7-9 g/dL. Pyuria was found on urinalysis, but the urine culture only grew yeast, which is likely a contaminant. 

The patient's care includes continuing tube feeds through a Dobhoff tube, monitoring for rehabilitation, and managing his medications including anticoagulation, stress ulcer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of recent major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has respiratory failure, pneumonia caused by MRSA, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, erythema around an arterial line, anemia, and pyuria due to a yeast infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are any complications with ventilatory support or if the underlying cause of the failure is not adequately addressed.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, there is a risk of recurrent or new infections due to his prolonged hospitalization and weakened immune system.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may progress if fluid overload occurs or if heart function deteriorates further.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Hypertension: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension could lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's worsening renal function indicates a potential decline in kidney health, which may require adjustments in medication dosages and fluid management.
6. Arterial Line Erythema: Although the arterial line was removed and cultures remained negative, there is"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Low NIF
s and recurrently
   ventilatory failure soon after extubation with other etiologies
   excluded seems to suggest primary muscle weakness (EEG performed to
   rule out secondary causes).  Patient has been trached due to need for
   prolonged ventilatory support  and will go to rehab for further
   pulmonary rehab. Blood gas this afternoon shows hypercarbia but primary
   metabolic alkalosis with resp compensation 7.44/50/ 109/35
    # Pneumonia: Patient had collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a 14
   day course of vancomycin for this.  No fevers, chills, or signs of
   active infection.
    #Pulmonary edema: Patient has had pulmonary edema previously and
   continues to have trace lower extremity edema.  We will continue to
   monitor respiratory status and attempt gentle diuresis as tolerated.
   No need for diuresis today
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  amlodipine (started [**2-8**])
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is mildly worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5
   and has been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with
   pre-renal failure and improved with hydration (Cr down to 1.5) but has
   mildly worsened with attempted diuresis. Have not been diuresing for
   several days.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   # Arterial line erythema:  A-line removed and cultures remained
   negative.  Patient did receive two doses of cautionary vancomycin.
    # Anemia:  Hct 24.4 and near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
    #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.
   - continue to monitor- family wants foley out prior to d/c . Will d/w
   urology on Monday
   # FEN: Dobhoff placed, continue tubefeeds
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI
   # Communication: W/ [**Name (NI) 2856**], HCP.

","The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of recent major gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has respiratory failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and is currently in normal sinus rhythm. The patient's kidney function is mildly worsened from baseline creatinine levels of 1.4-1.5. He has anemia with a hematocrit level of 24.4 and near baseline. The patient also has pyuria, which is likely caused by a yeast contaminant in his urinary catheter. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 116/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including heparin for DVT prophylaxis, a proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and other medications for his various conditions. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 50, and partial pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident associated with urinary tract infection, and treatment for hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has experienced progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been intubated multiple times due to mental status/weakness. 

The patient also has chronic polyneuropathy, which is contributing to neuromuscular weakness. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has undergone tracheostomy. 

Other medical issues include delirium with sundowning, anemia treated with packed red blood cells, and stable renal function with slight increase in creatinine during diuresis. 

Nutrition is being provided through Fibersource HN at a rate of 65 mL/hour. 

The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently on multiple medications for prophylaxis and treatment, including heparin for deep vein thrombosis, pantoprazole for stress ulcers, and vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, infections, kidney dysfunction, and complications related to the tracheostomy. It is important to monitor the patient's vital signs, ABG results, and continue with appropriate treatments and interventions as outlined"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Low NIF
s and recurrently
   ventilatory failure soon after extubation with other etiologies
   excluded seems to suggest primary muscle weakness (EEG performed to
   rule out secondary causes and demonstrated polyneuropathy).  Patient
   trached on [**2-16**] and has tolerated trach mask well without need for
   ventilator since [**2113-2-19**].
   - S&S eval for Passy-Muir valve
   # Pneumonia: Patient had collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a 14
   day course of vancomycin for this.  No fevers, chills, or signs of
   active infection.
   #Pulmonary edema: Patient has had pulmonary edema previously and
   continues to have trace lower extremity edema.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   hypoalbuminemia given ECHO in [**2-6**] showing normal LV systolic and
   diastolic function.  We will continue to monitor respiratory status and
   attempt gentle diuresis as tolerated.
   - lasix 10 mg IV x [**4-28**] need low dose lasix for maintenance
   # Insomnia:  Asked by family not to give seroquel after patient was
   somnolent in the setting of seroquel administration on [**2-19**].  However,
   patient expresses desire for sleep-inducing medication.
   - touch base with family re: restarting seroquel
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  amlodipine (started [**2-8**])
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is mildly worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5
   and has been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with
   pre-renal failure and improved with hydration (Cr down to 1.5) but has
   mildly worsened with attempted diuresis. Have not been diuresing for
   several days.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   # Arterial line erythema:  A-line removed and cultures remained
   negative.  Patient did receive two doses of cautionary vancomycin.
   # Anemia:  Hct near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.  Also, urology requests that patient follow-up as outpatient
   for removal of foley.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and is not currently anticoagulated. He has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and has shown improvement. The patient's recent medical history includes pulmonary edema, insomnia, anemia, pyuria, and CKD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient has experienced recurrent ventilatory failure after extubation, suggesting primary muscle weakness. An EEG ruled out secondary causes and demonstrated polyneuropathy.
2. Pneumonia: The patient had a collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and mucus plug. Although he has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin, there are no current signs of active infection.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has had previous episodes of pulmonary edema and continues to have trace lower extremity edema. This may be due to hypoalbuminemia, as an echo showed normal LV systolic and diastolic function.
4. Insomnia: The patient's family does not want to administer Seroquel, which caused somnolence, but the patient desires a sleep-inducing medication.
5. History of atrial fibrillation"

- Respiratory support: The patient is on standby ventilator mode, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an FiO2 of 50%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, PaO2 of 109 mmHg, HCO3- of 32 mEq/L, and BE of -2 mEq/L.
- Physical examination: The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, skin is not assessed, and neurologic examination is incomplete.
- Labs: The patient has a white blood cell count of 4.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 296 K/uL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 108 mg/dL, and sodium of 142 mEq/L, among other abnormalities.
- Imaging: There are no imaging studies mentioned in the progress note.
- Assessment and plan: The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypercapnic respiratory failure, pneumonia (previously treated with vancomycin), pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and anemia. The patient is being weaned off mechanical ventilation and will undergo pulmonary rehabilitation. The plan includes monitoring respiratory status, continuing antibiotics, and attempting gentle diuresis as tolerated. Renal dosing of medications and avoiding nephrotoxins are recommended. The patient's arterial line was removed due to erythema, but cultures remained negative. The patient has pyuria without bacteriuria, suggesting a possible yeast contamination. A coude foley catheter was placed on [**2113-2-7**] and will not be changed at this time. The patient's central venous catheter was placed on [**2113-2-17**]."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. The patient also has chronic polyneuropathy and has undergone tracheostomy. Other medical issues include delirium, anemia, and renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's repeated episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a potential for ongoing respiratory compromise. This could be due to neuromuscular weakness resulting from pneumonia and effusions.
2. Tracheostomy complications: As the patient has undergone tracheostomy, there is a risk of infection, bleeding, tracheal stenosis, and difficulty with decannulation.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium, characterized by sundowning at night, can be challenging to manage, especially considering the family's concerns about daytime somnolence. It is important to treat the delirium carefully to prevent further cognitive decline.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia requires ongoing monitoring and management, including transfusion if necessary.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, especially considering the slight increase in"

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and hypoxia. The patient was previously extubated twice but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely caused by neuromuscular weakness resulting from pneumonia and effusions. The patient has a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. Despite two trials of extubation, the patient failed and required tracheostomy and continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, specifically sundowning at night. The family is concerned about daytime somnolence and does not want to use seroquel or olanzipine for treatment.
3. Foley catheter: The patient has a Foley catheter placed by urology under direct visualization/cystoscopy. The family desires its removal prior to transfer to rehab, but urology recommends leaving it in throughout the hospitalization with removal/voiding trial to be done as an outpatient.
4. Anemia: The patient received packed red blood cells (PRBC) for anemia and will be followed up accordingly.
5. Renal function: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, slightly increased with"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of GI bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, and prolonged ICU stay. The patient has been diagnosed with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. He has failed two trials of extubation and is currently intubated with a tracheostomy. The patient is also experiencing delirium, particularly at night, and requires treatment with low doses of usual agents. The family is concerned about daytime somnolence and has requested not to use seroquel or olanzipine. The patient has a Foley catheter placed by urology under direct visualization/cystoscopy, and the family desires its removal prior to transfer to rehab. The patient received PRBCs for anemia and is being closely monitored for renal function. The patient is receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN at 65 mL/hour and is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to complications such as hypercarbia, respiratory acidosis, and increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can cause symptoms like confusion, drowsiness, headaches, and potentially lead to organ damage if not managed properly.
2. Neuromuscular weakness: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, chronic polyneuropathy, delirium, Foley catheter, anemia, and renal issues. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for five months and has experienced multiple episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/66 mmHg to 153/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in kidney function tests. Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing acidosis and potential organ damage.
2. Tracheostomy-related complications: The patient has a tracheostomy, which carries risks such as infection, bleeding, displacement, or obstruction.
3. Neuromuscular"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU stay, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident with urinary tract infection, and treatment for hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has had progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to multiple intubations and extubations. The patient was found to have chronic polyneuropathy and was tracheostomized. The patient's current issues include hypercapnic respiratory failure, delirium, Foley catheter, anemia, and renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's repeated episodes of hypercapnic respiratory failure indicate difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, characterized by fluctuating levels of consciousness, disorientation, and agitation. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, infections, and other complications. It is essential to address the underlying causes and manage symptoms promptly.

3. Tracheostomy complications: As the patient has undergone tracheostomy, there is a risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, displacement, or obstruction of the tracheostomy tube. Regular assessment and maintenance of the tracheostomy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and urinary tract infection. The patient presented with hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions. The patient has been intubated multiple times and currently has a tracheostomy. Other medical issues include delirium, anemia, and renal function. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including diuretics, antibiotics, and nutritional support. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying neuromuscular weakness, combined with pneumonia and effusions, has resulted in hypercapnic respiratory failure. This condition can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing symptoms such as confusion, headache, dizziness, and eventually, respiratory arrest if not managed properly.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is characterized by sudden changes in mental status, including confusion, disorientation, and hallucinations. Delirium can worsen the patient's overall prognosis and increase the risk of complications such as falls, infections, and worsening respiratory status.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may contribute"

   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Low NIF
s and recurrently
   ventilatory failure soon after extubation with other etiologies
   excluded seems to suggest primary muscle weakness (EEG performed to
   rule out secondary causes and demonstrated polyneuropathy).  Patient
   trached on [**2-16**] and has tolerated trach mask well without need for
   ventilator since [**2113-2-19**].
   - S&S eval for Passy-Muir valve
    # Pneumonia: Patient had collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a 14
   day course of vancomycin for this.  No fevers, chills, or signs of
   active infection.
    #Pulmonary edema: Patient has had pulmonary edema previously and
   continues to have trace lower extremity edema.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   hypoalbuminemia given ECHO in [**2-6**] showing normal LV systolic and
   diastolic function.  We will continue to monitor respiratory status and
   attempt gentle diuresis as tolerated.
   - lasix 10 mg IV x [**4-28**] need low dose lasix for maintenance
   # Insomnia:  Asked by family not to give seroquel after patient was
   somnolent in the setting of seroquel administration on [**2-19**].  However,
   patient expresses desire for sleep-inducing medication.
   - touch base with family re: restarting seroquel
    #History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  amlodipine (started [**2-8**])
    # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is mildly worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5
   and has been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with
   pre-renal failure and improved with hydration (Cr down to 1.5) but has
   mildly worsened with attempted diuresis. Have not been diuresing for
   several days.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
    # Arterial line erythema:  A-line removed and cultures remained
   negative.  Patient did receive two doses of cautionary vancomycin.
    # Anemia:  Hct near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
    #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.  Also, urology requests that patient follow-up as outpatient
   for removal of foley.
   - touch base with urology to confirm foley management plan

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o with h/o GI bleed s/p colectomy/respiratory failure/prolonged
   ICU course (5 mo), PE, CVA a/w UTI then tx for hypoxia, tachycardia,
   and altered mental status.  Progressive hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, so intubated ([**2-1**]).  Thick secretions. Did well and extubated
   ([**2-6**]) - progressive hypercarbic failure so reintubated ([**2-7**]) likely
   due to mental status/weakness.  Extubated ([**2-9**]) and reintubated later
   that day
 neuromuscular eval c/w chronic polyneuropathy.  Pt
   trached.
   # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:
   - Likely due to neuromuscular weakness (NIF [**8-24**]) c/b PNA and
   effusions.
   - Failed 2 trials of extubation -> trach
   - Fentanyl boluses prn
   - TC as tolerated (family requested pt not be put back on PS)
   - S/p vanc for MRSA PNA x 14 days
   - Will need to be seen by IP prior to decannulation given concerns over
   scar tissue from first trach limiting his extubation
   - Check ABG prn (family requested one be sent yesterday with somnolent)
   - Eval for PMV valve/SLP consult today
   #Delerium:
   - Sundowning at night
   - Family concerned about daytime somnolence, but now okay with using
   seroquel
   # Foley: Placed by urology under direct visualization/cystoscopy.
   Family desires it removed prior to transfer to rehab, but urology
   recommended to leave it in throughout this hospitalization with
   removal/voiding trial to be done as outpatient.
   # Anemia:  PRBC this admission
   - Will follow
   # Renal:
   - Creatinine stable
   - Renally dose medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   - Continue to follow
   #FEN: dophoff with TF
   - S/p Dophoff for feeding
 deferred PEG, but now pulled Dophoff
   - SLP eval to determine if pt can eat.
   All other issues per resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident with urinary tract infection, and treatment for hypoxia, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has had multiple episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation and extubation. He also has a chronic polyneuropathy and is currently tracheostomized.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure:
- Likely due to neuromuscular weakness caused by pneumonia and effusions.
- Failed two trials of extubation, so the patient is now on long-term tracheostomy.
- Fentanyl boluses as needed for pain management.
- Titration of sedation as tolerated.
- Treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia for 14 days.
- Consultation with an otolaryngologist prior to decannulation due to concerns over scar tissue from the first tracheostomy limiting extubation.
- Frequent checking of arterial blood gas (ABG) levels.

2. Delirium:
- Sundowning at night.
- Family concerned about daytime somnolence but now agrees to use Seroquel for delirium management.

3. Foley catheter:
- Placed by uro"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, colectomy, respiratory failure, prolonged ICU course, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident. The patient has been admitted multiple times due to hypoxia, tachycardia, altered mental status, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been intubated and extubated several times. The patient has a chronic polyneuropathy and is currently tracheostomized. He is being treated for hypercapnic respiratory failure, delirium, Foley catheter, anemia, renal issues, and feeding problems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic polyneuropathy may contribute to his respiratory failure. Interventions such as non-invasive ventilation or tracheostomy may be necessary.
2. Delirium: The patient exhibits signs of delirium, including sundowning at night and daytime somnolence. Medications like Seroquel may be prescribed to manage symptoms.
3. Foley Catheter: The patient has a Foley catheter placed by urology. There is a family desire to remove it prior to transfer to rehab, but urology recommends leaving it in throughout the hospitalization.
4. Anemia: The patient requires packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion this admission. Further management of anemia will be determined.
5. Renal Issues: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, and medications are being dosed accordingly. Renal dosing and avoidance of nephrotoxins are important considerations.
6. Feeding Problems: The patient underwent a duodenal feeding tube placement (Dophoff) for nutrition. A speech-language pathology (SLP) evaluation will determine if the patient can eat orally.
7. Restraints: The need for restraints should be reviewed regularly.
8. Tracheostomy Care: The patient's tracheostomy site needs to be monitored for any signs of infection or complications.
9. Potential Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis measures such as boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued to prevent DVT.
10. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be continued to prevent stress ulcers.
11. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Measures to prevent VAP, such as head-of-bed elevation, oral care, and respiratory system bowl index (RSBI) assessment, should be implemented."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o man with recent major GI bleed w/prolonged hospitalization who
   is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] as a transfer from the floor for agitation,
   hypoxia, tachycardia.
    # Hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Low NIF
s and recurrently
   ventilatory failure soon after extubation with other etiologies
   excluded seems to suggest primary muscle weakness (EEG performed to
   rule out secondary causes and demonstrated polyneuropathy).  Patient
   trached on [**2-16**] and has tolerated trach mask well without need for
   ventilator since [**2113-2-19**].
   - Did well with Passy-Muir today for brief periods
   # Pneumonia: Patient had collapsed left lower lobe secondary to staph
   aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely mucus plug.  He has completed a 14
   day course of vancomycin for this.  No fevers, chills, or signs of
   active infection.
   -monitor, recheck CXR tomorrow
   #Pulmonary edema: Patient has had pulmonary edema previously and
   continues to have trace lower extremity edema.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   hypoalbuminemia given ECHO in [**2-6**] showing normal LV systolic and
   diastolic function.  We will continue to monitor respiratory status and
   hold diuresis today due to elevated Cr
   -keep fluid balance equal today
   - may need low dose lasix for maintenance
   # Insomnia:  Asked by family not to give seroquel after patient was
   somnolent in the setting of seroquel administration on [**2-19**].  However,
   patient expresses desire for sleep-inducing medication.  Family
   reluctantly agreed.
   # History of Afib/HTN:  Currently in NSR.  Not anticoagulated per
   patient choice despite history of stroke.
   -Continue metoprolol with good holding parameters in order to avoid
   risks of Afib with RVR.
   -Cont  amlodipine (started [**2-8**])
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient is mildly worsened from baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5
   and has been since presentation.  Initially appeared consistent with
   pre-renal failure and improved with hydration (Cr down to 1.5) but has
   mildly worsened with attempted diuresis.   Holding diueresis and aiming
   for goal I and O of equal.
   -Renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins (i.e. IV contrast)
   # Arterial line erythema:  A-line removed and cultures remained
   negative.  Patient did receive two doses of cautionary vancomycin.
   # Anemia:  Hct near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.  Also, urology requests that patient follow-up as outpatient
   for removal of foley.
   - touch base with urology to confirm foley management plan
   # FEN: Dobhoff placed, continue tube feeds
   # PPx: heparin SC and continue PPI
   # Communication: W/ [**Name (NI) 2856**], HCP.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old man with recent major GI bleed who was admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He has been diagnosed with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to primary muscle weakness, pneumonia caused by staph aureus (MRSA), pulmonary edema, and insomnia. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and pyuria with yeast contamination in urine culture.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's primary muscle weakness may lead to recurrent ventilatory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia relapse: Although the patient has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, there is still a risk of recurrence or development of new infections.
3. Pulmonary edema exacerbation: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen due to hypoalbuminemia and other underlying factors, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
4. Insomnia and agitation: The patient's insomnia and agitation can lead to increased stress and discomfort, potentially affecting his overall well-being and recovery.
5. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. CKD progression: The patient's mild worsening from"

   # Arterial line erythema:  A-line removed and cultures remained
   negative.  Patient did receive two doses of cautionary vancomycin.
   # Anemia:  Hct near baseline of 25-27.  Will follow.
   #Pyuria: Patient with leukocyte esterase and pyuria on UA but culture
   only growing yeast.  This is most likely a contaminant.  Coude foley
   placed on [**2113-2-7**] by urology, will not change for moment as unable to
   replace.  Also, urology requests that patient follow-up as outpatient
   for removal of foley.

","Summary:
An 82-year-old man with a recent major gastrointestinal bleed and prolonged hospitalization is admitted to the ICU for agitation, hypoxia, and tachycardia. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, but is currently in sinus rhythm. He has been experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, insomnia, anemia, pyuria, and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis. He has undergone tracheostomy and has tolerated the tracheal mask well without the need for a ventilator since February 19th. His laboratory results show mild worsening from baseline creatinine and he has been since presentation. He is being closely monitored for various medical complications and is receiving appropriate treatments and interventions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ICU stay: The patient's recent major GI bleed and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of developing complications associated with a prolonged ICU stay, such as delirium, muscle weakness, and pressure ulcers.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of hypercapnic respiratory failure and recurrent ventilatory failure suggest a potential risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or exacerbation of pulmonary edema.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension may predispose him to cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Renal impairment: The patient's mild worsening from baseline creatinine indicates potential renal impairment"
