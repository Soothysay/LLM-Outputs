   recurrence of her baseline recurring chest pain with development of
   tamponade physiology now s/p pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericarditis/ Tamponade: Ultimate etiology of pericarditis and
   effusion unclear.  The patient's elevated JVP with respiratory
   variation and tamponade with minimal effusion are both concerning for
   constrictive pericarditis.  Lack of pressure tracings from actual
   procedure make constrictive physiology rather hard to confirm. Patient
   may have recurrent pericarditis causing her pain complaints though
   previous echos have never shown similar findings.  Work up underway.
   -Pericardial drain to gravity, will remove as output trails off
   -Await results of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] send inflammatory markers ESR and CRP for
   better idea of possibility of chronic inflammatory state
   -Repeat TTE today to evaluate for reaccumulation
   -Regular pulsus checks

   -If oxygen sats decrease or becomes tachycardic/tachypnic, consider
   re-evaluating for PE

   hypercoagulable state has been unremarkable.  Likely needs full work-up
   but patient has not kept outpatient follow up appointments.  MRI
   negative for central pulmonary lesions/thromboses. Also would be
   cautious with anticoagulation given blood in pericardial fluid and fear
   of hemorrhagic conversion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), coronary artery disease (CAD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF).
- She presented with recurrent chest pain and was found to have tamponade physiology, which was managed by pericardial drain.
- The patient has an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) with respiratory variation, suggesting constrictive pericarditis.
- She has a history of chest pain associated with heart failure exacerbation.
- The patient is hypervolemic but improving, and her coronary artery disease is being managed with beta-blockers.
- She has a previous workup for hypercoagulable state that was unremarkable, but further evaluation is needed.
- The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, likely due to hemodynamic instability, and will be monitored closely.
- She has anemia with a low hematocrit (Hct) and may require endoscopy if her Hct continues to fall.
- The patient has well-controlled hypertension and depression/anxiety, for which she is receiving citalopram and clonazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent pericarditis: The patient's pain complaints and elevated JVP with respiratory variation suggest recurrent pericarditis. This can be confirmed through further evaluation, such as repeating TTE (transesophageal ech"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of venous thromboembolism, coronary artery disease, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She presented with recurrent chest pain and was found to have tamponade physiology. She underwent pericardial drain and removal of 410cc pericardial fluid. The patient has multiple allergies to medications including penicillins, aspirin, Motrin, Tylenol, codeine, Plavix, Percocet, Zofran, and morphine. She also has edema in both lower extremities. Her vital signs are stable, but her respiratory support is required due to a low oxygen saturation level of 93%. The patient has an elevated JVP with respiratory variation, which is concerning for constrictive pericarditis. The etiology of her pericarditis and effusion is unclear. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased Hct, creatinine, and potassium levels. An echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular systolic function, and a small to moderate-sized pericardial effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse. The patient's cardiac catheterization showed pericardial tamponade, moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension, elevated right-sided filling pressures, and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small to
   moderate sized pericardial effusion. There is right ventricular
   diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
   physiology.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-2-1**], right
   ventricular collapse is now present.
   [**2-3**] Cardiac cath: 1. Pericardial tamponade with improvement in
   pericardial pressure after

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old female with strange and complicated past medical history of
   VTE, CAD, and dCHF and multiple vascular risk factors presenting with
   recurrence of her baseline recurring chest pain with development of
   tamponade physiology now s/p pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericarditis/ Tamponade: Ultimate etiology of pericarditis and
   effusion unclear.  The patient's elevated JVP with respiratory
   variation and tamponade with minimal effusion are both concerning for
   constrictive pericarditis.  Lack of pressure tracings from actual
   procedure make constrictive physiology rather hard to confirm. Patient
   may have recurrent pericarditis causing her pain complaints though
   previous echos have never shown similar findings.  Work up underway.
   -Pericardial drain to gravity, will remove as output trails off
   -Await results of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] send inflammatory markers ESR and CRP for
   better idea of possibility of chronic inflammatory state
   -Repeat TTE today to evaluate for reaccumulation
   -Regular pulsus checks
   -Initiate colchicine for pericarditis, can c/w PRN PO hydromorphone
   -Keep drain in place until no further output
   .
   # Pump: Patient has an acute exacerbation of her diastolic heart
   failure and has previously had chest pain in the context of heart
   failure exacerbation.  Hypervolemia is improving
   -continue BB, no ASA due to allergy
   -Consider restarting home PO furosemide if patient remains stable and
   hold off on aggressive further diuresis for now
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient in NSR, continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient has other clear etiologies for chest pain and
   flat troponins so minimal suspicion for ACS.
   -Continue BB, no ASA due to allergy
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -If oxygen sats decrease or becomes tachycardic/tachypnic, consider
   re-evaluating for PE
   .
   # History of venous thomboembolic disease: Previous work up for
   hypercoagulable state has been unremarkable.  Likely needs full work-up
   but patient has not kept outpatient follow up appointments.  MRI
   negative for central pulmonary lesions/thromboses. Also would be
   cautious with anticoagulation given blood in pericardial fluid and fear
   of hemorrhagic conversion.
   -Hold heparin drip
   -Likely restart coumadin when patient stable
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Creatinine elevated to 2.2 (baseline ~1.2). Likely
   hemodynamic in the context of tamponade and other issues.  Will trend,
   hold fluids for now especially as tamponade now resolved. U/A
   unrevealing, other than [**12-25**] RBCs
   -Monitor BUN/creat
   -Avoid nephrotoxins
   -Urine lytes
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home statin.
   .
   # Gastritis: Continue Pantoprazole
   .
   # Anemia: Hct low but stable. Low-normal MCV. Has reportedly had guaiac
   positive stools
   -Continue PPI
   -Trend Hct, if continues to fall may need endoscopy

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of venous thromboembolic disease, coronary artery disease, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with recurring chest pain and was found to have pericardial effusion leading to tamponade physiology. A pericardial drain was placed, and she is currently being monitored for reaccumulation of fluid. Other issues include an exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, potential constrictive pericarditis, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient also has hyperlipidemia, gastritis, anemia, hypertension, presumed depression/anxiety, and requires dietary modifications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Recurrence of pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
2. Constrictive pericarditis, which may cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema.
3. Exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, leading to worsening symptoms like shortness of breath and fluid retention.
4. Chronic kidney disease, indicated by the elevated creatinine level.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding, suggested by the guaiac positive stools.
6. Thromboembolic events, considering the patient's history of VTE and hypercoagulable state.
7. Respiratory infections, as indicated by the need for prophylaxis against ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Poor glycemic control, which could lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old female with strange and complicated past medical history of
   VTE, CAD, and dCHF and multiple vascular risk factors presenting with
   recurrence of her baseline recurring chest pain with development of
   tamponade physiology now s/p pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericarditis/ Tamponade: Ultimate etiology of pericarditis and
   effusion unclear.  The patient's elevated JVP with respiratory
   variation and tamponade with minimal effusion are both concerning for
   constrictive pericarditis.  Lack of pressure tracings from actual
   procedure make constrictive physiology rather hard to confirm. Patient
   may have recurrent pericarditis causing her pain complaints though
   previous echos have never shown similar findings.  Work up underway.
   -Pericardial drain to gravity, will remove as output trails off
   -Await results of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] send inflammatory markers ESR and CRP for
   better idea of possibility of chronic inflammatory state
   -Repeat TTE today to evaluate for reaccumulation
   -Regular pulsus checks
   -Initiate colchicine for pericarditis, can c/w PRN PO hydromorphone
   -Keep drain in place until no further output
   .
   # Pump: Patient has an acute exacerbation of her diastolic heart
   failure and has previously had chest pain in the context of heart
   failure exacerbation.  Hypervolemia is improving
   -continue BB, no ASA due to allergy
   -Consider restarting home PO furosemide if patient remains stable and
   hold off on aggressive further diuresis for now
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient in NSR, continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient has other clear etiologies for chest pain and
   flat troponins so minimal suspicion for ACS.
   -Continue BB, no ASA due to allergy
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -If oxygen sats decrease or becomes tachycardic/tachypnic, consider
   re-evaluating for PE
   .
   # History of venous thomboembolic disease: Previous work up for
   hypercoagulable state has been unremarkable.  Likely needs full work-up
   but patient has not kept outpatient follow up appointments.  MRI
   negative for central pulmonary lesions/thromboses. Also would be
   cautious with anticoagulation given blood in pericardial fluid and fear
   of hemorrhagic conversion.
   -Hold heparin drip
   -Likely restart coumadin when patient stable
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Creatinine elevated to 2.2 (baseline ~1.2). Likely
   hemodynamic in the context of tamponade and other issues.  Will trend,
   hold fluids for now especially as tamponade now resolved. U/A
   unrevealing, other than [**12-25**] RBCs
   -Monitor BUN/creat
   -Avoid nephrotoxins
   -Urine lytes

   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home statin.

   # Gastritis: Continue Pantoprazole

   # Anemia: Hct low but stable. Low-normal MCV. Has reportedly had guaiac
   positive stools
   -Continue PPI
   -Trend Hct, if continues to fall may need endoscopy

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a complex medical history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), coronary artery disease (CAD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). She presents with recurrent chest pain and evidence of tamponade physiology, which has been treated with a pericardial drain. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent pericarditis: The patient may have recurrent episodes of pericarditis causing her pain complaints. Further evaluation and management are required to prevent future episodes.

2. Constrictive pericarditis: The patient's elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) with respiratory variation and tamponade with minimal effusion are concerning for constrictive pericarditis. Confirmation of this diagnosis may be challenging without pressure tracings from the pericardial procedure.

3. Acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure: The patient has an acute exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure. Close monitoring and management are necessary to optimize cardiac function and prevent further complications.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (Hct) level and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to address the anemia and its underlying cause.

5. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired renal function. Monitoring kidney function and avoiding neph"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), coronary artery disease (CAD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF). The patient presented with recurrent chest pain and signs of tamponade physiology, which were treated with a pericardial drain.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Constrictive pericarditis: The elevated JVP with respiratory variation and tamponade with minimal effusion are concerning for constrictive pericarditis. Lack of pressure tracings from the actual procedure make constrictive physiology hard to confirm.

2. Recurrent pericarditis: The patient may have recurrent pericarditis causing her pain complaints, although previous echos have never shown similar findings.

3. Acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure: The patient has an acute exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure, previously associated with chest pain in the context of heart failure exacerbation.

4. Hypervolemia: The patient is hypervolemic, which is improving. Aggressive further diuresis is being held off for now.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has other clear etiologies for chest pain and flat troponins, minimizing suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), coronary artery disease (CAD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF) presenting with recurrent chest pain and tamponade physiology. The patient underwent a pericardial drain and now shows no signs of tamponade.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrence of pericarditis and effusion: The patient may develop recurrent episodes of pericarditis, leading to the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac.
2. Constrictive pericarditis: The elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) with respiratory variation and tamponade with minimal effusion are concerning for constrictive physiology. This condition restricts the heart's ability to fill properly during diastole.
3. Acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure: The patient has an acute exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure, which can lead to worsening symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and reduced exercise tolerance.
4. Hypervolemia: The patient's hypervolemia needs to be monitored and managed appropriately to prevent fluid overload and further complications.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD, and there is minimal suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to evaluate for any"
