   Assessment and Plan
   #. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Patient initially presented with abdominal
   pain and nausea and vomiting with lipase>3000 and evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis on CT scan. Amylase and lipase have since trended
   down but patient still has pain on exam.
   - continue meropenem for necrotizing pancreatitis. DC if our cultures
   are negative.
   - pain control with dilaudid IV
   # ETOH Withdrawal/abuse: Patient reportedly agitated at OSH secondary
   to ETOH withdrawal and has reported heavy daily ETOH intake. No prior
   h/o withdrawal but has been in active withdrawal there on ativan drip
   and also getting haldol for agitation. Last ETOH [**12-22**] or [**12-23**].
   - Valium PO as tolerated
   - MVI, thiamine, folic acid banana bag QDay
   - Follow K, Mg, Phos and replete as needed
   - Order vitamin B, niacin levels (thiamine levels not necessary bc pt
   has received thiamine)
   # GPC bacteremia: Most likely sources include catheter related
   bloodstream infection given PICC line or intrabdominal source. Will
   treat with vanco and [**Last Name (un) **] for now while awaiting speciation and
   sensitivities. WBC seems to be trending down from prior when was 30K.
   - continue vanco and meropenem
   - check vanc level in 12 hours
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely multifactorial secondary to pancreatitis
   and bacteremia.
   - check urine cx, repeat blood cx, C diff
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 1540**] for now as above
   - Tylenol PRN fever
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely secondary to pain, fever, and dehydration
   as well as ETOH withdrawal.
   - continue clonidine (taper to 0.2 PO to avoid rebound hypertension)
   - Continue IVF maintenance.
   - pain control with dilaudid IV.
   - CIWA per protocol.
   # AMS: Likely secondary to med effect and infection but would have low
   threshold to CT head given difficult to assess neuro exam.  Ativan drip
   and haldol discontinued.
   - consider CT head if mental status does not improve.
   - monitor per CIWA

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and Crohn's disease. He was admitted for acute pancreatitis and EtOH withdrawal delirium tremens (DTs). The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications and conditions.

1. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with significantly elevated lipase levels (>3000) and evidence of pancreatic necrosis on the CT scan. Although the amylase and lipase levels have trended down, the patient still experiences pain during the examination. The treatment plan includes continuing meropenem for necrotizing pancreatitis and providing pain control with Dilaudid IV.

2. ETOH Withdrawal/abuse: The patient reportedly became agitated at the outside hospital due to ETOH withdrawal and has a history of heavy daily ETOH intake. He has been receiving Ativan drip and Haldol for agitation. The last known ETOH intake was on [**12-22**] or [**12-23**]. The treatment plan includes Valium PO as tolerated, MVI, thiamine, folic acid banana bag QDay, repletion of K, Mg, Phos as needed, and ordering vitamin B and niacin levels.

3. GPC Bacteremia: The most likely sources of bacteremia include a catheter-related bloodstream infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Patient initially presented with abdominal
   pain and nausea and vomiting with lipase>3000 and evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis on CT scan. Amylase and lipase have since trended
   down but patient still has pain on exam.
   - continue meropenem for necrotizing pancreatitis
   - pain control with dilaudid IV
   # ETOH Withdrawal/abuse: Patient reportedly agitated at OSH secondary
   to ETOH withdrawal and has reported heavy daily ETOH intake. No prior
   h/o withdrawal but has been in active withdrawal there on ativan drip
   and also getting haldol for agitation. Last ETOH [**12-22**] or [**12-23**].
   - d/c ativan drip and change to valium PO as tolerated, may need ativan
   prn if unable to tolerate POs but would prefer longer acting valium and
   self-taper
   - MVI, thiamine, folic acid
   - aggressively replete electrolytes
   # GPC bacteremia: Most likely sources include catheter related
   bloodstream infection given PICC line or intrabdominal source. Will
   treat with vanco and [**Last Name (un) **] for now while awaiting speciation and
   sensitivities. WBC seems to be trending down from prior when was 30K.
   - continue vanco and meropenem
   - check random vanc level
   - consider linezolid to cover VRE if decompensates
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely multifactorial secondary to pancreatitis
   and bacteremia.
   - check urine cx, repeat blood cx, C diff
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 1540**] for now as above
   - Tylenol PRN fever
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely secondary to pain, fever, and dehydration
   as well as ETOH withdrawal.
   - continue clonidine (taper to avoid rebound hypertension)
   - Continue IVF maintenance.
   - pain control with dilaudid IV.
   - CIWA per protocol.
   # AMS: Likely secondary to med effect and infection but would have low
   threshold to CT head given difficult to assess neuro exam.  Ativan drip
   and haldol discontinued.
   - consider CT head if mental status does not improve.
   - monitor per CIWA

","Summary:
- 44-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and Crohn's disease admitted to OSH for acute pancreatitis and entered EtOH withdrawal DTs.
- Transfer to Hospital1 ICU.
- Patient has been placed on various lines, including a PICC line, and is receiving multiple medications for prophylaxis and treatment.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and elevated blood glucose levels.
- Labs indicate elevated WBC count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging and microbiology results are pending.
- The patient is currently being managed for acute pancreatitis, alcohol withdrawal, and has a history of Crohn's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and pending cultures suggest the possibility of an infection. The presence of a central line also increases the risk of line-associated infections.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for complications associated with alcohol withdrawal, including seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), and autonomic instability.
4. Crohn's Disease Flare-up: The patient's history of Crohn's disease increases the risk of a flare-up during times of stress or illness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of acute necrotizing pancreatitis and alcohol withdrawal. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing delirium, agitation, and confusion. The patient has had multiple tubes placed, including an NG tube and a feeding tube. He is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics. His blood cultures have shown positive results for GPCs, but no growth was observed in two bottles from December 26th. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. He also has elevated liver enzymes, particularly ALT and AST. Imaging studies have not been performed yet. The patient is being treated with medications such as diazepam, haloperidol, and multivitamins. His nutritional support includes a feeding tube with Peptamen 1.5. The patient's condition is stable, and he is currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of acute necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or abscesses.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens, seizures, or hallucinations. Close monitoring and appropriate medication management are necessary to prevent complications.
3. Infection: The positive blood cultures indicate the presence of an infection in the patient's body. If"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with acute necrotizing pancreatitis and ETOH withdrawal. He is currently less sedated and more agitated, requiring restraints. The patient has been placed on a tube for frequent stooling and post-pyloric feeding tube for tube feeds. A PICC line has been placed, and a chest X-ray has been ordered for today. The patient's c.diff negative, and vancomycin has been given again with a trough level of 4.6. The patient's allergies include unknown allergies, and he has a history of Crohn's disease. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood cultures from Hospital3 show GPCs in a cluster and two bottles from 12-26 with no growth. Other lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and elevated platelet count. Imaging and microbiology data are pending. The patient's medications include diazepam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and hydromorphone. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for diarrhea, agitation, and delirium.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and Crohn's disease. He was admitted with necrotizing pancreatitis and required treatment for alcohol withdrawal. The patient also had a history of consuming 1/4 bottles of GPC in clusters from OSH, and was on vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/66 to 134/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's general appearance is not well-nourished, and he appears agitated. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin levels, and increased lactic acid levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include delirium/confusion, acute pancreatitis, and alcohol withdrawal. The plan involves supportive care, hydration, serial labs/exams, and ruling out any obstruction through RUQ USG. The patient will receive banana bag QD, check thiamine and niacin levels, hold benzos/haldol, and continue vancomycin. The patient will also have post-pyloric tube placement for nutritional support and transition clonidine"
