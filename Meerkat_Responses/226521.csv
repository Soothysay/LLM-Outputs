   - Patient initially started on Vanc and Zosyn.  Called from OSH with

   coverage GNR sepsis (rec by uro) insetting of possible prostatitis.
   - Low blood pressures: fluid boluses and maint fluids
   - K of 6 --> repeat K 5.3 after fluids. Lactate of 1.3.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and renal stones. He presented with abdominal pain and was found to have left pyelonephritis and a high suspicion for renal and prostate abscesses. The patient underwent interventional radiology (IR) drainage, which resulted in the drainage of bloody fluid from the perinephric site and pus-like fluid from the prostatic site. There is concern that the needle may have drained the bladder instead of the prostate. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn and vancomycin) and has been given one dose of gentamicin for double coverage against gram-negative rods (GNR) sepsis, as recommended by the urology team.

Medical Complications:
1. GNR Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for GNR bacteria, indicating a systemic infection. The addition of gentamicin is intended to provide double coverage against GNR organisms.
2. Possible Prostatitis: The patient's prostatic massage revealed tenderness and boggy consistency, suggesting prostatitis. The drainage procedure may have caused trauma to the prostate, leading to this condition.
3. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, indicating anemia. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 1.4"

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin, with the addition of gentamicin for double coverage against Gram-negative bacteria. Blood and urinary cultures have been ordered, and the patient is scheduled for hemodialysis today. His other medical conditions include hypertension and anemia, for which he is being closely monitored. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests a possible severe infection, which could progress to sepsis if not effectively managed.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:  60 yoM with history of ESRD and renal stones presenting
   with abdominal pain, found to have left pylonephritis and high
   suspecion for renal and prostate abscesses.
   PLAN:
   # Pylonephritis/renal and prostatic abscesses: Pt may have seeded
   urinary tract during recent urologic procedures. Possible causative
   organisms would include urinary flora (E. Coli, enterococcus, staph)
   versus MRSA given indwelling stent.  Patient went for IR drainage
   yesterday which resulted in 4cc bloody fluid from perinephric site and
   5cc pus like fluid from prostatic site.  There is some concern that the
   needle went through the prostate and drained the bladder.  Called by
   OSH for +BC
 GNR in
 bottles.  Lactate decreased with fluids and
   blood pressure responeded to fluids.
   - continue emperic broad coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin.  Add one
   dose of Gentamycin to double cover GNR.
   - follow-up blood and urinary cultures
   - hold all antihypertensives for now
   - pyridium and narcotics for pain control
   # ESRD: MWF schedule as above. Will notify renal of pt's presence so HD
   may continue.  Will hold ACEi for now as above.  Continue renagel.
   -HD today.
   # HTN: Hold antihypertensives for now given tenuous clinical status.
   Restart lisinopril and amlodipine when BP allows.
   # Anemia: No baseline for comparison. Will trend for now. Will send T&S
   given planned surgery.
   # Coagulopathy: INR 1.5 on admission. No prior history of liver
   disease, but will check LFTs. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to nutritional status.
   Will trend and give 1 mg Vitamin K in anticipation of surgery.
   # FEN: feed him today if not getting procedure.

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 5725**]
s note and I agree
   with the findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 5708**] was admitted with
   urosepsis, including hypotension and positive blood cultures.  Today he
   is doing much better.  His blood pressure, while not his norm, is
   certainly adequate for perfusion and has only  needed fluids, not
   pressors. Lactate much improved. He also feels better and even is
   demanding to eat! We will give double GNR coverage for a couple more
   days, but I think his Vancomycin can be stopped, as no evidence of a
   GPC infection. He should remain in MICU for at least another day, but
   hopefully soon thereafter he will be stable enough for transfer to the
   wards with urology f/u.  35 min spent in the care of this critically
   ill patient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and renal stones who presented with abdominal pain. He was found to have left pyelonephritis and a high suspicion for renal and prostate abscesses.

The patient underwent interventional radiology (IR) drainage yesterday, which resulted in the removal of bloody fluid from the perinephric site and pus-like fluid from the prostatic site. There is concern that the needle may have drained the bladder instead of the prostate. The patient has been on empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin. Additionally, one dose of gentamicin was added to double cover gram-negative bacteria (GNR) sepsis, considering the possibility of prostatitis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/55 mmHg to 162/129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is hemodynamically stable with fluid resuscitation and maintains a normal sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (18.1 K/uL), hemoglobin (9.0 g/dL), creatinine (7.8 mg"

   A 60 year-old man with history of ESRD and renal stones presenting with
   abdominal pain, found to have left pylonephritis and high suspecion for
   renal and prostate abscesses.

   Pseudomonas in [**3-13**] culture bottles, sensitivities pending. So far
   patient received vanco and gent x1 dose. Currently on Zosyn for empiric

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and renal stones.
- He presented with abdominal pain and was found to have left pyelonephritis and suspected renal and prostate abscesses.
- The patient underwent interventional radiology (IR) drainage, resulting in the removal of bloody fluid from the perinephric site and pus-like fluid from the prostatic site.
- Blood cultures are growing Pseudomonas, and antibiotic sensitivities are pending.
- The patient has been started on Zosyn for empirical coverage against Pseudomonas.
- He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the plan is to continue this until follow-up blood culture sensitivities are available.
- The patient will be held on all antihypertensives for now, and pain control will be managed with Pyridium and narcotics.
- Tamsulosin and finasteride have been prescribed by the urology team.
- The patient will require a 5-week antibiotic course, after which the stent can be removed.
- For ESRD management, the patient will continue on a MWF schedule as previously planned, with ongoing HD and Renagel.
- Antihypertensives will be restarted when the patient's blood pressure allows.
- Anemia is likely due to ESRD and"

   Chief Complaint: prostatic abscess s/p drainage
   24 Hour Events:
   - hemodialysis- no fluid removed
   - micro data- GNR in urine, prostatic abscess fluid, and [**2-11**] bcx; (from
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital [**6-8**]: Pseudomonas aeroginosa 2/2 blood cultures,
   no sensitivities yet)
   - stopped vancomycin, continued Zosyn and gentamicin
   - urology recs- keep stent in, to be removed by outpatient urologist
   once infection clears in [**3-15**] weeks; keep foley to gravity until
   discharge, once afebrile and no leukocytosis; start flomax and proscar;
   continue antibiotics for 4-6 weeks for prostatitis; ADAT
   - renal recs- increase Zosyn to 2.25g IV q8h; dose gent by level, stop
   maintanence fluids
   - access- PIV x3
   - goal I+O- slightly positive overnight
   - CXR- probable subsegmental atelectasis or scarring at the left base.
   Consider followup imaging to exclude progression to infiltrate, if
   clinically indicated. No CHF. Right IJ line tip, as described. No ptx.
