       -Continue Thiamine/Folate.
   2. Abdominal pain.  Very benign exam.
          -No amylase/lipase drawn at [**Hospital1 781**].  Will Check here.
   3. Pancytopenia - pt with low WBC, HCT and plts, most likely related to
   chronic liver disease leading to bone marrow suppression from EtOH.
         -Will check B12 level.  Folate supplementation has already begun.
   4. AMS -  Seems appropriate this morning.
   5. EtOH Abuse - per ED records last drink 5 days ago, will place on
   CIWA scale given unclear time course of EtOH ingestion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple medical problems admitted with alcoholic ketoacidosis and abdominal pain/N/V. The patient has a mixed acid-base disturbance with triple disorder of AG metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and non-anion gap acidosis. He is refusing blood draws today. The patient's abdominal pain is very benign, and no amylase/lipase was drawn. He has pancytopenia with low WBC, HCT, and plates, which is most likely related to chronic liver disease leading to bone marrow suppression from EtOH. The patient also has acute memory syndrome (AMS), EtOH abuse, tachycardia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a history of cardiac arrest, and failure to thrive (FEN). The patient is currently on a regular diet if tolerated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mixed Acid-base disturbance: The patient has triple disorder of AG metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and non-anion gap acidosis. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, rapid breathing, and changes in blood pH levels.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has low WBC, HCT, and plates, which can increase the risk of infections, anemia, and bleeding disorders.

3. EtOH abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse can lead to complications such as liver damage, gastrointestinal bleeding, malnutrition, and withdrawal symptoms"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-inch tall individual with a weight not specified. They are admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of EtOH withdrawal, EtOH ketoacidosis, and a history of cardiac arrest. The patient has been placed in four-point restraints due to being deemed incompetent by the psych team and given lorazepam (Ativan) and haloperidol (Haldol). The patient's vital signs show a slightly low body temperature, normal heart rate, elevated blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and high oxygen saturation. The patient has been monitored using the CIWA scale for EtOH withdrawal. 

Fluid balance indicates an intake of 3,984 mL with 763 mL being IV fluids and output of 2,100 mL including 180 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output is 1,800 mL and the NG output is 583 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a normal ABG result.

","Summary:
The patient is a male with chief complaints of EtOH withdrawal and EtOH ketoacidosis. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone several interventions. They have been given ativan and haldol for agitation, monitored on CIWA, and placed in 4-point restraints. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.7C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 138/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mixed Acid-base Disturbance: The patient has a triple disorder of AG metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and non-anion gap acidosis. This is likely due to EtOH ketoacidosis. The patient's elevated ketones and acetone levels indicate this. The plan is to continue IVF, monitor chemistry every 12 hours, and continue thiamine and folate.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has low WBC, HCT, and platelets, which is most likely related to chronic liver disease leading to bone marrow suppression from EtOH. B12 and folate levels are pending.
3. EtOH Abuse: The patient's last drink was 5 days ago, and they will be placed on CIWA to assess the time course of EtOH ingestion."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with complaints of EtOH withdrawal, EtOH ketoacidosis, and incompetence in making medical decisions. The patient was deemed incompetent by psychiatry and placed in 4-point restraints. Lorazepam and haloperidol were administered to manage agitation and potential harm. Vital signs are within normal limits, with a slight deviation in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,984 mL and output of 2,100 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates stable conditions.

The patient has been on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and nasal cannula. ABG results show mixed acid-base disturbance, including AG metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and non-AG metabolic acidosis. Labs reveal pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's history of heavy EtOH use raises concerns for EtOH withdrawal and potential underlying dementia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. AMS - Unclear baseline, possibly due to dementia or personality disorder. Incompetent to make medical decisions.
2. Mixed Acid-base disturbance - triple disorder of AG metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and non-AG metabolic acidosis.
3. Pancytopenia - likely related to chronic liver disease.
4. EtOH Abuse - CIWA scale to monitor withdrawal symptoms.
5. COPD - supportive management.

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Mixed Acid base disturbance - pt with triple disorder of AG
   metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis and non-anion gap acidosis.
   1. AG Metabolic Acidosis - AG 22. AG metabolic acidosis most likely
   related to EtOH ketoacidosis. Pt with elevated ketones and acetone. No
   hx of DM. No increase in OSM gap - 8.
   - Continue D5 NS, received banana bag in ED
   - Monitor chemistry q8
   - Continue thiamine and folate
   2. Resp alkalosis - likely secondary to underlying hepatic disease
   3. Non AG metabolic acidosis - may be related to dehydration, diarrhea,
   vs decrease in unmeasured cations - pt with low Mg, P and Ca.
   - continue rehydration as above
   - replete electrolytes
   - repeat ABG in am
   .
   #. Pancytopenia - pt with low WBC, HCT and plts, most likely related to
   chronic liver disease leading to bone marrow suppression from EtOH.
   Will check LFTs. Consider medication effect
 pt on PPI, less likely.
   Viral infection less likely, no sx of active infection. Check B12 and
   folate to evaluate for anemia.
   .
   #. AMS - Unclear baseline, most likely related to acid base
   disturbance. No evidence of infection. Tox screen negative. Will treat
   supportively as above.
   .
   #. EtOH Abuse - per ED records last drink 5 days ago, will place on
   CIWA scale given unclear time course of EtOH ingestion.
   - SW consult in am
   .
   #. COPD - continue supportive management, albuterol prn
   .
   #. Hx cardiac arrest - unclear etiology. Given EtOH history will
   aggressively replete electrolytes, monitor K and Mg and maintain K>4
   and Mg>2. Continue metoprolol.
   .
   #. FEN - regular diet
   .
   #. Prophy - SC heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old male with a chief complaint of EtOH withdrawal and ketoacidosis. The patient has low electrolytes, which are being repleted IV. The patient's mental status has improved, and they are now alert and oriented to place and time. They are cooperative with medical care. The patient has a history of heavy EtOH use and may have dementia related to long-term EtOH abuse. The patient is also experiencing a mixed acid-base disturbance with triple disorder of anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and non-AG metabolic acidosis. The AG metabolic acidosis is most likely related to EtOH ketoacidosis, with elevated ketones and acetone. The patient is euvolemic and tolerating PO, so DC IVF. The respiratory alkalosis is likely secondary to underlying hepatic disease. The non-AG metabolic acidosis may be related to dehydration, diarrhea, or a decrease in unmeasured cations. The patient has low magnesium (Mg), phosphate (P), and calcium (Ca). The tachycardia is most likely due to severe deconditioning, but further evaluation is needed to rule out other causes. The pancytopenia is most likely related to chronic liver disease leading to bone marrow suppression from EtOH. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and may also have COPD. The cause of the patient's cardiac arrest is unclear, but aggressive re"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of EtOH withdrawal and ketoacidosis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to low electrolytes, persistent agitation, and a history of heavy alcohol use. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they exhibit sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2739 mL and output of 2340 mL, resulting in a balance of 399 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.25. The patient's physical examination reveals anxiety, normal cardiovascular findings, and absent peripheral pulses. Neurologic assessment shows the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli, but movement and tone are not assessed. Lab results indicate low potassium, sodium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient has a history of COPD and is on metoprolol. They also have a history of cardiac arrest, but the etiology is unclear. The patient is evaluated by psychiatry and deemed incompetent to make medical decisions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's history of heavy alcohol use and current symptoms of agitation and somnolence suggest the possibility of EtOH withdrawal. This condition can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and even death if not properly managed.

2. Ketoacidosis: The patient's elevated ketones and acetone indicate the presence"
