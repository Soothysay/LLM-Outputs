","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old man with schizophrenia and neuromuscular disorder.
- He presents with sigmoid volvulus and is unable to provide history as he is sedated.
- The patient has undergone invasive ventilation and colonoscopy for volvulus decompression.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/72 to 133/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory system compliance of 45, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%.
- The patient's abdominal examination reveals tenderness and distention, while extremity pulses are absent on the right side and weak on the left side.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging shows improvement in dilated loops of bowel.
- The patient has been given ciprofloxacin for suspected urinary tract infection, and further decompression of the volvulus is planned with a barium enema.
- The patient's respiratory failure etiology is unclear, and potential causes include sepsis, abdominal infection, or atelectasis due to a distended"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with schizophrenia and neuromuscular disorder who presented with sigmoid volvulus. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient underwent colonoscopy in the unit, resulting in successful decompression of one volvulus. However, the repeat abdominal x-ray showed improvement but not resolution. The patient's lactate levels improved, and he is being closely monitored with serial abdominal exams. The plan is to consider a barium enema or repeat endoscopy, depending on the patient's condition. The patient also has a urinary tract infection, for which he is receiving empirical ciprofloxacin. His blood, sputum, and urine cultures are pending. The patient's hyperlipidemia, schizoaffective disorder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and fenofibrate use have been noted and appropriate measures have been taken. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he will be monitored in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with schizophrenia and a neuromuscular disorder. He is currently in the ICU due to a sigmoid volvulus, which is a condition where the sigmoid colon twists around itself, causing obstruction. The patient has undergone a barium enema, which showed partial distal volvulus and a possible new ulcerating mass in the splenic flexure. Surgery and GI consultation have been sought. The family has decided not to proceed with surgery at this time. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, likely caused by atelectasis due to his distended abdomen. He is on mechanical ventilation and receiving supplemental oxygen. He also has a urinary tract infection, hyperlipidemia, schizoaffective disorder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and is being held on non-pharmacological interventions for these conditions while in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid Volvulus: The patient's condition of sigmoid volvulus poses a risk of complications such as bowel necrosis, perforation, and peritonitis if not promptly addressed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in lung function, possible pneumonia, or the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The positive urine analysis suggests a UTI, which if left untreated, can progress to a more severe infection and potentially spread to the kidneys, leading to pyeloneph"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid volvulus: The patient may be at risk for recurrent episodes of volvulus, which can lead to bowel obstruction and ischemia.
2. Ulcerating mass in the splenic flexure: The presence of an ulcerating mass could indicate a malignancy or inflammatory condition, which may require further investigation and management.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could recur if adequate lung expansion is not maintained, leading to further deterioration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with sigmoid volvulus, who underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with partial decompression and a barium enema with persistent volvulus. The patient's lactate levels are declining, and there are no signs of sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The family is being consulted regarding surgery. The patient is intubated but has normal respiratory mechanics and is following commands. It is planned to extubate the patient today and discuss the surgical option with the family. A colonic mass was revealed on the barium enema. The patient was successfully extubated and was able to communicate with the family, leading to a decision to proceed with surgical resection of the colonic mass and volvulus. The patient was taken to the operating room.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's declining lactate levels suggest that there is an ongoing infection or sepsis. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and take appropriate measures to control it.

2. Colonic perforation: During the surgical resection of the colonic mass and volvulus, there is a risk of colonic perforation. Care must be taken during the procedure to avoid perforation and subsequent development of peritonitis or abscess formation.

3. Anesthesia-related complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with sigmoid volvulus, failing conservative therapy but
   DNR and family unwilling to make decision re: surgery without speaking
   to him. Intubated
   at OSH but normal mechanics today and follwoing commands of sedation.
   Will plan on extubating today and then speak with family to make a
   decision about surgery. Bariium
   enema reveals probable colonic mass, w/u pending discussions with
   family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a sigmoid volvulus. He underwent an EGD with partial decompression and a barium enema, which showed persistent volvulus. His lactate levels are declining, and there are no signs of sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The patient is currently intubated but has normal respiratory mechanics and is following commands while sedated. The plan is to extubate him today and discuss surgical options with the family, as they are unwilling to make a decision without speaking to the patient. A probable colonic mass was revealed by the barium enema, and further investigation is pending. The patient has a history of abdominal distension, and his vital signs are relatively stable. His laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine. Imaging shows stable colonic distension. The patient's condition is critical, and he is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently in the ICU."
