   24 Hour Events:
   82 F admitted [**2-12**] for L total hip replacement. EBL 500cc during
   surgery. On the morning of [**2170-2-14**], the patient was noted to be
   more hypoxic and lethargic. She was given more IV fluids for concern of
   dehydration.
   Later during the day sats were dropping to 80%.  She was placed on a
   non-rebreather face mask.  She was denying any chest pain.  She had a
   mild cough, poorly productive.  She had no nausea, no vomiting, no
   clear documentation of aspiration.  She appeared pale.  She was sleepy,
   but easily arousable and cooperative.  She appeared initially in no
   acute distress.  Rapid response was called and the patient was
   transferred to the ICU for initial concern of congestive heart failure.
   On [**2-14**] had CXR with perihilar lower lobe opacities and LUL opacity
   with concern of HF vs. multifocal PNA. Patient's respiratory status
   decompensated and repeat CXR showed LUL, LLL, RML, RLL opacities more
   suggestive of aspiration PNA, subsequently patient was intubated that
   night. Patient was started on norepinephrine.
   Patient was started on ASA, heparin held given drop in HCT. 2 units
   PRBC being given. On Vanco and Zosyn. Scheduled for RP u/s to r/o
   bleed.
   .
   On arrival to the floor she was intubated and found to be
   hemodynamically stable. Floor EKGs showed ST depression in lateral
   leads and slow R wave progression. At 9pm was hypotensive with MAPS to
   46 about 1 hour after getting metoprolol 12.5. EKG unchanged, started
   on levophed, backed off sedation.
   .
   CXR [**2170-2-15**]
   There is improvement in the prior severe pulmonary edema, however a
   left upper lobe opacity appears similar. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
   and hilar contours are normal. There are small bilateral pleural
   effusions. An ET tube terminates 3 cm above the carina in appropriate
   position. An NG tube terminates below the diaphragm in appropriate
   position.
   .
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: Echo from [**2169-12-28**] showed EF 60-65%. minimally
   thickened mitral valve leaflet, mild (1+) MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] AS, valve
   area 1-1.2, borderline systolic hypertension and normal wall motion.
   .
   Echo from [**2170-2-15**] shows EF 25-30%, mod to severe MR, new with severe
   regional left ventricular systloic dysfunction with akinesis of apex,
   mid and lower anterior septum and anterior wall of left ventrical I.e
   new anteroapical wall motion abnormality with increased mitral
   regurgitation and congestive heart failure.
   Echo [**2149**]: mild thickening of aortic valve. mild late  systolic
   prolapser of the posterior mitral leaflet with associated
   regurgitation. Left ventricular chamber size and wall thickness is wnl.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, an 82-year-old female, underwent left total hip replacement surgery and experienced significant blood loss during the procedure, resulting in an estimated blood loss of 500cc. On the morning of the second day, the patient was noted to be more hypoxic and lethargic. She was given additional intravenous fluids for concern of dehydration.

During the day, the patient's oxygen saturation levels continued to drop to around 80%. She was placed on a non-rebreather face mask. Although she denied any chest pain, she had a mild cough that was poorly productive. There were no documented instances of aspiration, and she appeared pale but was awake and easily arousable.

The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to a rapid response being called. She was transferred to the ICU for initial concern of congestive heart failure (CHF). A chest X-ray revealed perihilar lower lobe opacities and left upper lobe opacity, raising concerns of either CHF or multifocal pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status further declined, and a repeat chest X-ray showed opacities in multiple lung lobes, indicating possible aspiration pneumonia. Subsequently, the patient was intubated.

The patient was started on norepinephrine and given blood products due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration. She was also started on vancomycin and piperacillin-taz"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82 y/o woman s/p hip replacement now intubated for
   respiratory distress with ? PNA, noted on echo to have acutely worsened
   MR. Etiology of MR could be ischemic. Has echo showing new antero
   apical wall motion abnormality which would suggest plaque in LAD. Has
   poor R wave progression which would be consistent with anterior

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman who underwent a left total hip replacement and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She was given more IV fluids due to concerns of dehydration, but her condition worsened with hypoxia and lethargy. She was placed on a non-rebreather face mask, and her saturation levels dropped to 80%. She denied any chest pain, but had a mild cough and appeared pale.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for initial concern of congestive heart failure (CHF), and a chest X-ray revealed perihilar lower lobe opacities and left upper lobe opacity, which could be indicative of heart failure or pneumonia. Her respiratory status deteriorated further, leading to the decision to intubate her.

Subsequent investigations showed elevated cardiac enzymes, specifically troponin 1.54 and CK 969, which peaked at 1800. The patient was started on norepinephrine and anticoagulation therapy with heparin, but it was held due to a drop in hemoglobin (HCT) level. Two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) were given.

A repeat chest X-ray showed opacities in the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe, suggesting aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and she required increased ventilatory support.

   24 Hour Events:
   82 F admitted [**2-12**] for L total hip replacement. EBL 500cc during
   surgery. On the morning of [**2170-2-14**], the patient was noted to be
   more hypoxic and lethargic. She was given more IV fluids for concern of
   dehydration.
   Later during the day sats were dropping to 80%.  She was placed on a
   non-rebreather face mask.  She was denying any chest pain.  She had a
   mild cough, poorly productive.  She had no nausea, no vomiting, no
   clear documentation of aspiration.  She appeared pale.  She was sleepy,
   but easily arousable and cooperative.  She appeared initially in no
   acute distress.  Rapid response was called and the patient was
   transferred to the ICU for initial concern of congestive heart failure.
On [**2-14**] had CXR with perihilar lower lobe opacities and LUL opacity with concern
 of HF vs. multifocal PNA. Patient's respiratory status decompensated and repeat
 CXR showed LUL, LLL, RML, RLL opacities more suggestive of aspiration PNA, subs
equently patient was intubated that night. Patient was started on norepinephrine
.  EKGs showed widening of QRS and T and she started to have lateral ST-T change
s. Troponin 1.54 with CK 969  which peaked at 1800.
   Patient was started on ASA, heparin held given drop in HCT. 2 units
   PRBC were g
   Iven. Vanco and Zosyn. Scheduled for RP u/s to r/o bleed.
   .
   On arrival to the floor she was intubated and found to be
   hemodynamically stable. Floor EKGs showed ST depression in lateral
   leads and slow R wave progression. At 9pm was hypotensive with MAPS to
   46 about 1 hour after getting metoprolol 12.5. EKG unchanged, started
   on levophed, backed off sedation. Gas showed 02 of 64% with 02 sats 99%
   therefore increased PEEP from [**4-14**] with repeat gas 1 hour later .
   .
   CXR [**2170-2-15**]
   There is improvement in the prior severe pulmonary edema, however a
   left upper lobe opacity appears similar. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
   and hilar contours are normal. There are small bilateral pleural
   effusions. An ET tube terminates 3 cm above the carina in appropriate
   position. An NG tube terminates below the diaphragm in appropriate
   position.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman who underwent left total hip replacement surgery and is now experiencing multiple medical complications. 

1. The patient initially presented with hypoxia and lethargy, and was given more IV fluids due to concern of dehydration. Her condition worsened, leading to a drop in oxygen saturation levels, prompting the placement of a non-rebreather face mask.

2. The patient's respiratory status continued to deteriorate, and she was intubated for respiratory failure. A chest X-ray revealed perihilar lower lobe opacities, which could indicate either congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia (PNA). Subsequently, the patient's condition was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. The patient's cardiac status is also of concern. A 2D echocardiogram (ECHO) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 60-65% on [**2169-12-28**], indicating normal heart function. However, a subsequent ECHO on [**2170-2-15**] revealed a significant decline in EF to 25-30%, along with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), new regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and akinesis of the apex, mid, and lower anterior septum, and anterior wall of the left ventricle. These findings suggest acute ischemic changes in the heart, possibly due"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82 y/o woman s/p hip replacement now intubated for
   respiratory distress with ? PNA, noted on echo to have acutely worsened
   MR. Etiology of MR could be ischemic. Has echo showing new antero
   apical wall motion abnormality which would suggest plaque in LAD. Has
   poor R wave progression which would be consistent with anterior
   ischemia but her ST depressions are in V5-V6 more consistent with
   ischemia involving Lcx -this may suggest diffuse disease. Also has ?
   PNA, endocarditis a possibility although no evidence of this on echo.
   Ischemia does not seem to be just demand related.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress after undergoing hip replacement surgery. She has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and is currently intubated. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and signs of possible sepsis. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has a history of MI, and the progress note mentions new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram, suggesting a possible new MI. This could lead to further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially admitted for respiratory distress, which necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of a left upper lobe opacity on chest X-ray.

3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.

4. Cardiac Catheterization: Due to the patient's history of MI and the presence of ongoing symptoms, cardiac catheterization has been planned to assess coronary artery disease and determine appropriate management.

5. Worsening Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient's echocardiogram shows severe MR, which"

   Nutrition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress after undergoing hip replacement surgery. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's condition has been unstable with several complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced acute hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 47 from 72 after receiving metoprolol. Levophed was started to maintain blood pressure, and it returned to MAPs in the 60s to 70s.
2. Fever: The patient was febrile on admission, and the fever has since subsided. Blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine culture have been sent.
3. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), specifically a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This is suggested by EKG changes, new anterolateral wall motion abnormality on echo, and elevated cardiac enzymes.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia (PNA) with a left upper lobe opacity seen on chest X-ray. There is also evidence of pulmonary edema, but it is improving.
5. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. This is supported by fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the presence of a myocardial infarction and unstable blood pressure, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, and there is a risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Infection: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for further infections, especially considering her immunocompromised state due to the hip surgery and ongoing mechanical ventilation.
4. Bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been dropping, and there is concern for potential bleeding, although it has not been clinically evident so far.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to address the various complications and prevent further deterioration."

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is an 82-year-old woman who underwent a hip replacement and is now intubated for respiratory distress. She has a history of acute myocardial infarction and is suspected to have developed an acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI). The patient also has worsening mitral regurgitation (MR) and possible pneumonia. There are concerns about sepsis, respiratory failure, and a possible right hip replacement infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's symptoms and EKG changes suggest an ongoing myocardial infarction, specifically a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This requires prompt management and consideration for coronary angiography.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The cause of her respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and fluid overload. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.

3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection on the Gram stain suggest a possible sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and source control measures are necessary.

4. Right Hip Replacement Infection: The patient's recent hip replacement surgery puts her at risk for developing an infection. Clinical suspicion should be high, and appropriate cultures and imaging studies should be obtained.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman who underwent hip replacement surgery and is now experiencing respiratory distress. She is intubated and being treated for possible pneumonia. An echocardiogram revealed acute worsening of mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be due to ischemic changes in the heart. The patient also has evidence of new anterolateral wall motion abnormality on the echocardiogram, suggesting possible plaque in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). This could indicate ischemia involving the left circumflex artery (Lcx). The patient has been started on antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and statin.

The patient's blood pressure has been maintained in the low 100s, and she is being closely monitored for any signs of hypotension or ischemia/infarction. Her respiratory function is improving, but there is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) due to recent hip replacement surgery. However, there is no evidence of PE on the echocardiogram. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has dropped from 32.2 on admission to 29 currently, but there is no evidence of rectal bleeding clinically.

The patient is currently sedated with midazolam and is expected to undergo cardiac catheterization after extubation. She will continue to receive prophylactic antibiotics, deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman who underwent hip replacement surgery and is now intubated for respiratory distress with suspected pneumonia. She has a history of chronic heart failure and an echocardiogram showing acute worsening of mitral regurgitation. There are concerns about ischemic heart disease and possible endocarditis. The patient's blood pressure is in the low 100s, and she is being managed with levophed to maintain adequate blood pressure. Her respiratory distress is improving, but there are still concerns about possible pulmonary embolism or congestive heart failure. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 32 on admission to 29 currently, and there are concerns about gastrointestinal bleeding. She is being monitored closely with telemetry, serial cardiac enzymes, and frequent laboratory tests. The plan is to perform a cardiac catheterization to assess coronary artery disease and to wean off sedation and extubate the patient post-catheterization."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multi-lumen stop. She underwent arterial line placement, sheath placement, and invasive ventilation. The patient's allergies are unknown, and she received antibiotics (levofloxacin and piperacillin) as well as vancomycin. Her vital signs were stable with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 125/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She was extubated overnight. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1640 mL and output of 1700 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 60 mL. She received 400 mL of blood products, and her urine output was 1600 mL. She was on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic assessment. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (226 K/uL), slightly decreased hemoglobin level (9.9 g/d"

   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p cath yesterday, during which she
   had BMS placed to the LAD.
   - continue asa, plavix, metoprolol, statin
   - protonix to prevent ASA-related GI upset
   - will need to pull venous sheath today
   - repeat echo to look for any LV thrombus in the setting of a recent
   anterior infarct
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Likely related to HF in the setting of NSTEMI.
   PNA seems unlikely, and abx were d/c
ed yesterday. Pt is s/p extubation
   and is breathing comfortably.
   - f/u cx data, including data from [**Location (un) 3**]
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x1 this morning, recheck lytes in PM
   .
   # S/p Hip Sx: Hip site looks good per ortho with no concern for infx.
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - d/w ortho at [**Location (un) 3**] why pt is not on post-op anitcoagulation
   .
   #  Newly worsened MR on recent echo: possibly ischemic in nature.
   - repeat echo  as above

   # Hypotension: resolved, off pressors.
   .
   # HCT drop: HCT 32.2 on admission following 2U PRBC at [**Location (un) 3**]. Concern
   at OSH was for RP bleed however no evidence of this clinically and HCT
   trended down slowly from 32 on admit to 27 yesterday. Hct stable at 27

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress related to heart failure versus pneumonia. She had undergone hip replacement surgery and was transferred to another hospital due to an NSTEMI. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of a bare-metal stent in the left anterior descending artery. She was intubated but has now been extubated and is breathing comfortably.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, for which she will continue on aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and a statin. Protonix is prescribed to prevent gastrointestinal upset caused by aspirin. The venous sheath will be pulled today, and a repeat echo is needed to look for any left ventricular thrombus in the setting of a recent anterior infarct.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely related to heart failure in the setting of NSTEMI. Pneumonia seems unlikely, and antibiotics were discontinued yesterday. The patient's hip site looks good per orthopedics, with no concern for infection. It is noted that the patient should be on post-operative anticoagulation, and a discussion will be held with the orthopedic team.

A newly worsened mitral regurgitation on recent echo is possibly ischemic in nature, and a repeat echo is planned as above. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is off pressors. A drop in hematocrit from"

   82 y/o woman s/p hip replacement, transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for NSTEMI,
   intubated [**1-9**] respiratory distress related to heart failure vs. PNA.
   Now, s/p cath and extubation.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p cath yesterday, during which she
   had BMS placed to the LAD.
   - continue asa, plavix, metoprolol, statin
   - protonix to prevent ASA-related GI upset
   - will need to pull venous sheath today
   - repeat echo to look for any LV thrombus in the setting of a recent
   anterior infarct
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Likely related to HF in the setting of NSTEMI.
   PNA seems unlikely, and abx were d/c
ed yesterday. Pt is s/p extubation
   and is breathing comfortably.
   - f/u cx data, including data from [**Location (un) 3**]
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x1 this morning, recheck lytes in PM
   .
   # S/p Hip Sx: Hip site looks good per ortho with no concern for infx.
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - d/w ortho at [**Location (un) 3**] why pt is not on post-op anitcoagulation
   .
   #  Newly worsened MR on recent echo: possibly ischemic in nature.
   - repeat echo  as above
   .
   # Hypotension: resolved, off pressors.
   .
   # HCT drop: HCT 32.2 on admission following 2U PRBC at [**Location (un) 3**]. Concern
   at OSH was for RP bleed however no evidence of this clinically and HCT
   trended down slowly from 32 on admit to 27 yesterday. Hct stable at 27
   this morning. No evidence of bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for NSTEMI and respiratory distress. She underwent a hip replacement surgery, was intubated due to respiratory distress, and had a BMS placed in the LAD during a cardiac catheterization procedure. The patient's condition has been relatively stable overnight, with no new complaints or changes in vital signs. However, there are several potential medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had a BMS placed in the LAD during the cardiac catheterization procedure. It is important to continue antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), beta-blocker (metoprolol), statin, and proton pump inhibitor (for GI protection) to manage this condition. Additionally, a repeat echocardiogram should be done to look for any left ventricular thrombus in the setting of a recent anterior infarct.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely related to heart failure in the setting of NSTEMI. Pneumonia seems unlikely, and antibiotics were discontinued. The patient has been successfully extubated and is breathing comfortably. It is important to follow up with chest X-ray data and continue to monitor respiratory status. Lasix 20 mg IV should be given once today, and electrolytes should be rechecked in the afternoon.

","The patient is an 82-year-old woman who underwent a hip replacement and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress related to heart failure or pneumonia. She has since been extubated and is breathing comfortably. The arterial line and sheath have been removed. 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, a statin, and Protonix. The plan is to continue these medications and monitor her heart rate in the 60-70s range. 

A repeat echo will be done to check for any left ventricular thrombus in the setting of a recent anterior infarct, and warfarin may be considered for prophylaxis. 

The patient's hip site looks good with no concerns for infection. Ortho recommendations regarding post-operative anticoagulation are being sought. 

There is a newly worsened mitral regurgitation on recent echo, possibly ischemic in nature, and another repeat echo is planned. 

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is off pressors. The hematocrit level has dropped from 33 on admission to 29 yesterday, but there is no evidence of bleeding. 

The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status remains as full code, and her disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing hip replacement surgery. She was transferred to the hospital due to a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient had been intubated due to respiratory distress related to heart failure or possible pneumonia (PNA), but has since been extubated and is breathing comfortably. The arterial line and sheath have been removed. The patient has been started on lisinopril, metoprolol, and a statin, and will continue taking aspirin, clopidogrel, and a proton pump inhibitor to prevent gastrointestinal upset from aspirin. An echocardiogram has been ordered to look for any left ventricular thrombus in the setting of a recent anterior infarct, and warfarin may be considered for prophylaxis. The patient's hip site looks good with no concern for infection, but there is a concern for post-operative anticoagulation. The patient's mitral regurgitation has worsened on recent echo, possibly due to ischemic changes. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is no longer on pressors. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has dropped from 33 on admission to 29 yesterday, but there is no evidence of bleeding. The patient's blood cultures have been negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient had an NSTEM"
