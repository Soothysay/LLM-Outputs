   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   1. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  Neurologic etiologies
   such as seizure or stroke are also possible.  His pupils are fixed and
   dilated indicating either medication effect (paralytic) or neurological
   catastrophe. He is bradycardic; may be secondary to infarction vs.
   [**Location (un) **] reflex vs  medication effect given that he was on a b-blocker,
   although this is less likely.
   - cooling protocol with Arctic Sun aborted [**2-9**] bradycardia
   - trend enzymes and labs
   - neurology consult, 48 hour EEG per protocol
 likely to weigh in on
   brain death
   - sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
   - aspirin, lipitor for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is 3.0
 3.7
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation with PRN paralytic
   .
   3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Current electrolytes and acid/base status is
   increasingly acidotic and hyperkalemic.  Etiology for renal failure is
   likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.  Per report, pt received ~2L
   NS at the OSH and 1L NS in the ED with no output since. No response to
   Lasix. Renal failure likely to worse with epinephrine and severe
   bradycardia.
   - monitor volume status
   - urine electrolyes, UA
   - hold ACE, renally dose meds
   .
   4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - fluids to try to preserve kidney function
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE
   .
   5. ELEVATED WBC: Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI.
   - blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   6. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO
   .
   7. FEN: NPO for now; IV fluids
   .
   8. ACCESS: R femoral triple lumen; L arterial line; L intraosseous
   access placed in the field
   .
   9. PPX: INR therapeutic on Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis; Famotidine for
   stress ulcer prophylaxis; colace and senna PRN

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s).
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   His poor prognosis was discussed with the family. Will switch
   ventilators. Will rotate pt to see if we can optimize V/Q match.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient presented to the hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, and the etiology is unclear. It could be due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or a new ischemic event. Neurologic causes such as seizure or stroke are also possible. The patient's fixed and dilated pupils suggest either medication effect or neurological catastrophe.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His lungs sound clear but diminished, and a chest CT shows mild pulmonary edema. Weaning of vent settings should be done as tolerated, and sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics may be necessary.

3. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient is anuric (no urine output) with increasing acidosis and hyperkalemia. This suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to poor perfusion during the cardiac arrest. Monitoring volume status, urine electrolytes, and renal function tests are important.

4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest, which may have been caused by ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or a new ischemic event. Other potential causes include neurologic events such as seizures or stroke.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient is in full code status, indicating that all measures will be taken to resuscitate him. The etiology of the cardiac arrest is still under investigation, but possible causes include ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation due to scar tissue or a new ischemic event. Neurologic causes like seizures or stroke are also being considered.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His lungs sound clear but diminished, and there is evidence of mild pulmonary edema on chest CT. Weaning of ventilator settings will be done as tolerated, and sedation will be provided with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics as needed.

3. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient has anuria (no urine output) and is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor perfusion during the cardiac arrest. Electrolytes and acid/base status"

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   1. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  Neurologic etiologies
   such as seizure or stroke are also possible.  Given troponin elevation,
   most likely a cardiac event.  Bradycardia may be secondary to
   infarction vs. medication effect given that he was on a b-blocker,
   although this is less likely.
   - cooling protocol with Arctic Sun
   - trend enzymes and labs
   - neurology consult, 48 hour EEG per protocol
   - sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
   - aspirin, lipitor for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is 3.0, can re-address in AM
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   .
   3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Current electrolytes and acid/base status is
   stable.  Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion.  Per report, pt received ~2L NS at the OSH and 1L NS in the
   ED.
   - NS bolus to perfuse kidneys
   - monitor volume status
   - urine electrolyes, UA
   - hold ACE, renally dose meds
   .
   4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubed, has
   mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - fluids to try to preserve kidney function
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE
   .
   5. ELEVATED WBC: Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI.
   - blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   6. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO
   .
   7. FEN: NPO for now; IV fluids
   .
   8. ACCESS: R femoral triple lumen; L arterial line; L intraosseous
   access placed in the field

The patient's current condition includes:
1. CARDIAC ARREST: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is uncertain but may be due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or a new ischemic event. Troponin elevation suggests a cardiac event, and bradycardia may be secondary to infarction or medication effect.
- Initiating a cooling protocol with Arctic Sun
- Trending enzymes and labs
- Neurology consult, 48-hour EEG per protocol
- Sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
- Aspirin and Lipitor for possible NSTEMI
- Hold on heparin due to INR of 3.0, readdress in AM
- Hold on beta-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
- Continue amiodarone for arrhythmia

2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which was initiated following the cardiac arrest. His lungs sound clear, but a chest CT shows mild pulmonary edema.
- Wean vent settings as tolerated
- Fentanyl/Versed for sedation

3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient's renal failure is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to shock and poor perfusion. The patient received approximately 2 liters of normal saline at the outside hospital and 1 liter in the emergency department.
- Administer normal saline bolus to perfuse kidneys
- Monitor fluid balance
- Urine electrolytes and urinalysis
- Hold ACE inhibitors, renally dose medications

4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient has an ejection fraction of 35-40% and mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
- Administer fluids to preserve kidney function
- Monitor respiratory status
- Hold ACE inhibitors

5. ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT: The elevated WBC count may be due to stress response to cardiac arrest or possibly due to NSTEMI.
- Obtain blood cultures and urine culture
- Continue monitoring
- Hold on antibiotics for now

6. DIABETES: Continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
- Regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

7. FEEDING: Hold on enteral feeding for now; IV fluids

   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Despite better HR and blood
   pressure, patient's pupils are fixed and dilated indicating poor
   neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient currently has
   completely no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient
   breathing over the vent.
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol
   - f/u EP recs
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up after FFP is
   wearing off
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care after neuro
   status is more delineated.
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.  PaO2 was low yesterday but after patient was turned to lie on
   his right side, PaO2 improved significantly.  O2 sats have always been
   good though.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue to have patient lie on the right side to improve V/Q match
   .
   #. COAGULOPATHY: INR and PTT [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP wore off.  Together with
   thrombocytopenia, concerning for DIC. Could also be due to liver
   failure given elevated LFTs.
   - f/u on fibrinogen and RBC smears
   - f/u on repeat LFTs
   - transfuse cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR is [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP worn off
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia yesterday
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient presented to the hospital after experiencing cardiac arrest. The etiology of the cardiac arrest includes ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to scar tissue from prior infarctions or a new ischemic event. The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia, but it had to be stopped due to bradycardia. The patient's pupils are fixed and dilated, indicating poor neurological status. Neurological examination shows no brainstem reflex except for overbreathing on the ventilator, suggesting a very poor neurologic prognosis.

The patient's current conditions include anoxic brain injury, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, rhythm disturbances, anuric renal failure, congestive heart failure, leukocytosis, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT. The patient's INR and PTT are elevated after fresh frozen plasma (FFP) wore off, indicating a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, which may be due to stress response or a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient also has grossly infected urine analysis.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest. 

Summary of the note:
- The patient was in sinus rhythm but had fixed and dilated pupils, indicating poor neurological status.
- Neurological examination showed no brainstem reflexes except for breathing over the ventilator.
- The patient was initially on dopamine and isoproterenol to improve heart rate and blood pressure but has since been weaned off isoproterenol and dopamine is being titrated down.
- The patient has anoxic brain injury with no brainstem reflexes except for overbreathing on the ventilator.
- The patient has respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's INR and PTT were elevated after fresh frozen plasma (FFP) wore off, which could indicate coagulopathy, possibly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver failure.
- The patient has anuric renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to shock and poor perfusion.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm.
- The patient has leukocytosis, possibly due to stress response to cardiac arrest or NSTEMI.
- The patient is diabetic and is receiving insulin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's fixed and dilated pupils along with lack of brainstem reflexes suggest severe brain damage. Further evaluation and discussion with the neurology team will be necessary to determine the prognosis and potential for recovery.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the underlying cardiac and neurological conditions.
3. Coagulopathy: The elevated INR and PTT after FFP suggest a coagulation disorder. Monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is severely impaired, and dialysis may be required to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF, and it is important to monitor his cardiac status and adjust medications accordingly.
6. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, especially considering the patient's recent cardiac arrest and use of indwelling lines.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored, and appropriate insulin therapy should be continued.

It is crucial to continue collaboration between various specialties, including cardiology, neurology, nephrology, and critical care medicine, to manage the patient's complex medical conditions and prevent further complications."

   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Despite better HR and blood
   pressure, patient's pupils are fixed and dilated indicating poor
   neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient currently has
   completely no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient
   breathing over the vent.  Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s.
   - discontinue isoproterenol today
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - f/u EP recs
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up after FFP is
   wearing off
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine and isoproterenol
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.  PaO2 was low yesterday but after patient was turned to lie on
   his right side, PaO2 improved significantly.  O2 sats have always been
   good though.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   #. COAGULOPATHY: INR and PTT [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP wore off.  Together with
   thrombocytopenia, concerning for DIC. Could also be due to liver
   failure given elevated LFTs.  Fibrinogen normal, arguing against DIC.
   - f/u on RBC smears
   - f/u on repeat LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR is [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP worn off
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - d/c isoproterenol
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia yesterday
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented after cardiac arrest, which may have been caused by ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or a new ischemic event. The patient was on a cooling protocol with Arctic Sun but had to be stopped due to bradycardia, and amiodarone was discontinued.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate in the 60s-70s, blood pressure in the 100s-130s, respiratory rate around 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 28, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 100%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 89, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41/89 mmHg.

The patient's neurological status is poor, with fixed and dilated pupils, indicating possible brainstem"

   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Despite better HR and blood
   pressure, patient's pupils are fixed and dilated indicating poor
   neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient currently has
   completely no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient
   breathing over the vent.
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol, wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - f/u EP recs
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up after FFP is
   wearing off
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care after neuro
   status is more delineated.
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.  PaO2 was low yesterday but after patient was turned to lie on
   his right side, PaO2 improved significantly.  O2 sats have always been
   good though.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue to have patient lie on the right side to improve V/Q match
   .
   #. COAGULOPATHY: INR and PTT [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP wore off.  Together with
   thrombocytopenia, concerning for DIC. Could also be due to liver
   failure given elevated LFTs.
   - f/u on fibrinogen and RBC smears
   - f/u on repeat LFTs
   - transfuse cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR is [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP worn off
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia yesterday
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented after experiencing cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun due to anoxic brain injury but had to be aborted due to bradycardia. He is being supported with dopamine and isoproterenol. Neurologic examination shows fixed and dilated pupils indicating poor neurological status. The patient has no brainstem reflexes except for overbreathing on the ventilator and is not arousable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CARDIAC ARREST: The patient's cardiac arrest could be due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to scar tissue from prior infarctions or a new ischemic event. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are being supported with medications, but the fixed and dilated pupils indicate a poor prognosis.
2. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY: The patient sustained cardiac arrest, leading to uncertainty about the duration of lack of oxygen supply to the brain. The Arctic Sun cooling protocol was initiated but had to be stopped due to severe bradycardia. The patient's lack of brainstem reflexes suggests a very poor neurologic prognosis.
3. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient is currently on a ventilator due to respiratory failure. His"

   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR

   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch, from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented after experiencing cardiac arrest. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has shown poor neurological status, including unresponsiveness and fixed pupils. He requires mechanical ventilation and has been on dopamine and isoproterenol for cardiac support.

   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.    On pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   80%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock liver in
   the setting of hypotension in the past. Fibrinogen normal, arguing
   against DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum
   culture grew out 1+ gram neg diplococci.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**]) for now
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI) x 2, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented after cardiac arrest. The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but it may be due to ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation secondary to hyperkalemia and renal failure or scar tissue from prior infarction versus a new ischemic event. The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia using the Arctic Sun for 6 hours, which was stopped due to bradycardia in the 20s. The patient is now on dopamine 5 mcg/kg/min and isoproterenol 2 mcg/min, with an improved heart rate and blood pressure.

Neurologically, the patient has poor prognosis with no brainstem function seen on exam except for spontaneous respirations over the ventilator. However, overnight on [**1-18**], the patient demonstrated cough and gag reflexes. The neurology consult states that the patient has no brainstem function observed on the exam, indicating minimal cortical function at this time. The patient continues to be unresponsive.

Respiratory support includes being on pressure support (PS 16/5 on 80% FiO2) as the arterial blood gas (ABG) looked good, and the patient is"

The neurology consult states that the patient has no brainstem function seen on exam, except for spontaneous respirations over the vent. However, overnight on [**1-18**], the patient showed a cough and gag reflex. The patient continues to be unresponsive. An EEG has been ordered for further evaluation.

3. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient is currently on a ventilator, s/p cardiac arrest"

   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for
   overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some corneal
   reflex in left eye, has gag reflex.   EEG is not completely flat, but
   pt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating very poor neuro
   prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch, from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue ceftriaxone, start vanc today
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever yesterday [**1-18**].  WBC
   down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also has grossly infected
   UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum culture grew out 1+ gram
   neg diplococci. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - add vanc today, dose by level given pt on CVVH
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT, INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock
   liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen normal, arguing against
   DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Patient had a repeat TTE on yesterday.  EF
   of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is intubated, has mild pulmonary
   edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and placed on cooling protocol due to hyperkalemia and ventricular fibrillation. The patient's pupils are non-reactive, indicating poor neurologic status. He has minimal brainstem function but shows some cortical function. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate have been stable, but he has had episodes of bradycardia. He is currently on dopamine and isoproterenol, which have been weaned down.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning for hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to pulmonary edema, retrocardiac consolidation, and mediastinal hematoma. He is on pressure support with PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%. The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch. The patient's urine culture is negative, but sputum culture grew out 1+ gram-negative diplococci. He has grossly infected urine, and a fever yesterday. His WBC count is down-trending.

The patient has anuric renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis post-shock and poor perfusion. CVVH was started, but the filter clotted. His liver"

   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for
   overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some corneal
   reflex in left eye, has gag reflex.   EEG is not completely flat, but
   pt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating very poor neuro
   prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch, from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue ceftriaxone, start vanc today
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever yesterday [**1-18**].  WBC
   down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also has grossly infected
   UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum culture grew out 1+ gram
   neg diplococci. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - add vanc today, dose by level given pt on CVVH
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT, INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock
   liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen normal, arguing against
   DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Patient had a repeat TTE on yesterday.  EF
   of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is intubated, has mild pulmonary
   edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition indicates poor neurological status, with non-reactive pupils and minimal brainstem function. However, there are some signs of brainstem reflexes, such as cough and gag reflex.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent lack of oxygen to the brain have led to anoxic brain injury. This is indicated by the absence of brainstem reflexes, except for overbreathing on the ventilator, and the presence of corneal reflex in the left eye.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. A chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, and a chest X-ray revealed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. These findings suggest that the most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch caused by pulmonary edema, retrocardiac consolidation, and mediastinal hematoma.

3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever yesterday, and the white blood cell count is down-trending. The fever could be a response to the cardiac arrest or possibly due to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The presence of grossly infected"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished elderly man who is currently unresponsive and intubated. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/63 mmHg to 176/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for several days and has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics for a Moraxella infection, dopamine infusion, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper ventilation strategies and regular assessment of respiratory secretions are essential to prevent this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT. If left untreated, DVT can lead to a potentially life-threatening PE. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and consideration of prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin are important.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients, especially those with gastrointestinal bleeding, are at risk for stress ulcers. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and providing appropriate prophylaxis with H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors can help prevent this complication.

   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued this AM.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   .
#. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic sun termina
[**Male First Name (un) **] early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for overbrea
thing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some pupillary reflexes, a co
rneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex.   Preliminary EEG demonstrates som
e epileptic features and frontal rhythmic delta, but no seizures. However, patie
nt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosi
s. Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are await
ing a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further decisions.
- Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u final EEG read
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - discuss d/c
ing spinal collar with Ortho spine
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100.  WBC up slightly from [**1-19**], but
   essentially stable.  Patient had grossly infected UA, but negative
   urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for GPC
s in clusters.
   - Pull fem line given concern for infection
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. Femoral HD line in place for now, no CVVH since
   [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT
s trending down, INR and PTT stable indicating
   likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen >100,
   arguing against DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on Coumadin given INR >2
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is
   intubated, has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest, which resulted in anoxic brain injury. The patient has limited neurologic activity despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis. The family has made the decision to honor the patient's do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and is waiting for a final family member from abroad before making further decisions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's brain was deprived of oxygen during the cardiac arrest, leading to damage and dysfunction. The limited neurologic activity suggests a poor prognosis.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
3. Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, indicating an infection. The sputum culture grew Moraxella, and the blood culture from the femoral line grew Gram-positive cocci in clusters. These findings suggest a bacterial infection.
4. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is low, indicating renal failure. The etiology is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to shock and poor perfusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued this AM.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   .
#. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic sun termina
[**Male First Name (un) **] early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for overbrea
thing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some pupillary reflexes, a co
rneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex.   Preliminary EEG demonstrates som
e epileptic features and frontal rhythmic delta, but no seizures. However, patie
nt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosi
s. Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are await
ing a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further decisions.
- Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u final EEG read
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - discuss d/c
ing spinal collar with Ortho spine
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100.  WBC up slightly from [**1-19**], but
   essentially stable.  Patient had grossly infected UA, but negative
   urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for GPC
s in clusters.
   - Pull fem line given concern for infection
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. Femoral HD line in place for now, no CVVH since
   [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT
s trending down, INR and PTT stable indicating
   likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen >100,
   arguing against DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on Coumadin given INR >2
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is
   intubated, has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - CXR
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 10u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented after experiencing cardiac arrest, which was likely due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure or a new ischemic event.

The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia but had to be aborted due to bradycardia, which improved with dopamine and isoproterenol. The patient remains unresponsive with minimal brainstem and cortical function, as per EEG results. The family has made the patient do not resuscitate (DNR) status and is awaiting a final family member's arrival before making further decisions.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%. This is likely due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by a V/Q mismatch from pulmonary edema and a mediastinal hematoma. The patient also has a fever and leukocytosis, with a positive sputum culture for Moraxella and blood culture for Gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient's urine output has improved, but he is still oliguric, and the etiology of renal failure is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock and poor perfusion.

The patient also has liver injury with"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient's neurological activity remains limited, and he is unresponsive despite some brainstem function. The patient has been weaned off sedation, but there are minimal cortical functions. An MRI of the cervical spine is recommended before removing the c-collar. The family has made the patient do not resuscitate (DNR). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient sustained a cardiac arrest, and the EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly increasing brain function. This suggests potential for seizures and an underlying severe encephalopathy, which may be consistent with anoxic brain injury.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator and has bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema, and a clear chest X-ray. The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has had fevers ranging from 100-102 degrees Fahrenheit and an increasing white blood cell count. There is also evidence of a urinary tract infection, and blood cultures have grown out Moraxella and coag-negative staphylococci.
4. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's urine output has improved since admission, but he still has reduced kidney function. The etiology for renal failure is likely acute tubular necrosis secondary to shock and poor perfusion.
5. Liver Injury: The patient's liver function tests are trending down, indicating a likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension.
6. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine, but has a history of atrial fibrillation. Coumadin has been held due to an INR >2 and poor prognosis.
7. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 30-35% and evidence of mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Imaging: [**1-20**]
   In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], there is increasing sharpness
   of the pulmonary vessels, consistent with some improving elevation in
   pulmonary venous pressure. There are also may be some decrease in the
   retrocardiac lower lobe atelectasis in the left lung. Cardiomegaly
   persists.
   [**1-19**] EEG
   disorganization and slowing of the background rhythm with, at times,
   bifrontal semirhythmic delta activity with frequent embedded bifrontal
   spikes for runs of [**10-27**] seconds. This finding suggests potential for
   seizures and an underlying severe encephalopathy. Medications,
   toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are common causes. This
   finding may also be consistent with anoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. There were no
   definite electrographic seizures contained in this study. Compared to
   the prior 24 hours, this study shows increase in brain activity. A
   routine EEG may be repeated in a couple of days to assess for any
   interval change.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled on [**1-21**].
   possible NSTEMI, on asa, no bb.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - holding anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR; though
   normalizing
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic
   sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have
   some pupillary reflexes, a corneal reflex in the left eye, and gag
   reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly
   increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain injury (or
   'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable despite
   being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis. Family
   meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100 on [**1-20**] and 101 on [**1-21**].  WBC
   increasing by 2 since [**1-19**].  Patient had grossly infected UA, but
   negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for coag neg staph, and bcx from [**1-18**] also
   positive for GPC. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR, consider d/c regular cxr
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. No CVVH since [**1-18**], K+ is stable (normal). HD line
   pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT
s trending down, INR and PTT stable indicating
   likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen >100,
   arguing against DIC.
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on Coumadin given INR >2 and prognosis
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is
   intubated, has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - CXR, consider d/c regular cxr
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia and

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is still under investigation, with possible causes including ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure or scar tissue from previous infarction versus a new ischemic event. The patient underwent a cooling protocol with Arctic Sun but had to be aborted due to bradycardia, which improved with dopamine and isoproterenol. Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].

2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient sustained a cardiac arrest and had an early termination of the cooling protocol for bradycardia. The patient initially had no brainstem reflexes except for overbreathing on the vent, but now shows some pupillary reflexes, a corneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex. The EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, the patient remains unarousable despite being off sedation, indicating a poor neurologic prognosis. The family has made the decision to make"

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - start anticoagulation (heparin) today given INR is only 1.6, will
   stop if family decides to withdraw care
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])

   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.

   also trending down.
   - continue to follow coags

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Cardiac Arrest/Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction, or a new ischemic event. The cooling protocol with Arctic Sun was initiated but had to be aborted due to bradycardia. The patient is currently sedated and unresponsive, with no brainstem reflex except for a gag reflex. An EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with signs of likely anoxic brain injury. The family has made the decision for the patient to be DNR (do not resuscitate).

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to cardiac arrest. The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and mediastinal hematoma. The ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to the patient overbreathing on the vent. The plan is to wean vent settings as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day
   1:[**1-19**]).  Level stable even though pt did not get a dose of vanc
   yesterday.  Will hold off on giving another dose today, will re-check
   level tomorrow
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 20u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].
   - no IVF today
   - monitor respiratory status, wean the ventilator as tolerated
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient presented to the hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest and is now in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.7-100.8°F (38.2°C), heart rate of 81 bpm with an irregularly irregular rhythm (atrial fibrillation), blood pressure ranging from 136/60 mmHg to 152/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 50% FiO2. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at PEEP of 14 cmH2O, PS of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient has unequal and non-reactive pupils, no corneal reflex, but does have a gag reflex.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, elevated creatinine level, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and coagulation abnormalities. The sputum culture grew Moraxella, and blood cultures were positive for coag-negative Staphylococcus. The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to shock and poor perf"

   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.

   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - start anticoagulation (heparin) today given INR is only 1.6, will
   stop if family decides to withdraw care
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient presented after experiencing cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury.

The patient's current medical complications and their potential outcomes are as follows:

1. Cardiac Arrest/Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure or scar tissue from prior infarction versus a new ischemic event. The patient was on a cooling protocol with Arctic Sun, but it had to be aborted due to bradycardia. The patient's neurologic function is poor, with no brainstem reflex except for overbreathing on the vent, and an EEG showing moderate to severe encephalopathy with signs of likely anoxic brain injury. The prognosis for recovery of neurologic function is poor.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator and has been since the cardiac arrest.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day
   1:[**1-19**]).  Level stable even though pt did not get a dose of vanc
   yesterday.  Will hold off on giving another dose today, will re-check
   level tomorrow
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 20u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].
   - no IVF today
   - monitor respiratory status, wean the ventilator as tolerated
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia

He presented after cardiac arrest and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications.

The patient's current conditions include cardiogenic shock, anoxic brain injury, hypoxic respiratory failure, fever and leukocytosis, oliguric renal failure, liver injury, rhythm disturbances, and congestive heart failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 100.8°F (38.2°C)
- Heart rate: 81 beats per minute (bpm)
- Blood pressure: 136/60 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (inspiratory)
- Oxygen saturation: 94% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine, blood glucose, and liver enzymes. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been treated with various medications including Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, famotidine, morphine sulfate, insulin, and others. His current ICU care includes mechanical ventilation, central venous pressure monitoring, arterial line, and urinary catheter.

The patient's overall prognosis is poor due to anoxic brain injury, and the family has made the decision to"

   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c

   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.

   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for

   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient experienced cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. There is a concern for anoxic brain injury due to lack of oxygen supply to the brain during the arrest. The patient's EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy, indicating potential brain damage.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator due to hypoxic respiratory failure. This is likely caused by a combination of factors such as pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and mediastinal hematoma. The patient requires pressure support and high levels of FiO2 to maintain adequate oxygenation.

3. Infection: The patient has had fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. The sputum culture grew Moraxella, and the blood cultures were positive for coag-negative Staphylococcus. This suggests that the patient may have a bacterial infection, possibly pneumonia or bloodstream infection.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. The etiology of renal failure is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock and poor perfusion. The patient's urine output is low, further supporting the diagnosis of renal failure.

5. Liver Injury: The patient sustained a shock liver due to hypotension, but the liver function tests (LFTs) are currently trending down, indicating"

   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient suffered a cardiac arrest and had to be cooled, but the cooling protocol had to be aborted due to bradycardia. The patient's EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with signs of anoxic brain injury. The patient is unarousable despite being off sedation, indicating a poor neurological prognosis.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and mediastinal hematoma. The patient's ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation.

3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has had a persistent fever ranging from 100.7-100.8 degrees Celsius. The WBC count is stable, and there is evidence of a urinary tract infection with a positive urine culture for Moraxella. The patient's sputum culture also grew out Moraxella, and a retrocardiac opacity/consolidation was seen on the CXR. The patient had central lines and arterial lines"

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   PLAN FOR [**2117-1-23**]
   At 10am, pt will be extubated and made CMO at 10 am. We will not
   escalate care with regards to blood pressure and fever.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - CMO today
   - morphine drip if uncomfortable
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   -d/c abx today
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - cmo today
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   .
   #. DM:
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient presented to the hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. 

The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. Here are the potential medical complications mentioned in the note:

1. Cardiac Arrest/Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient suffered from a cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction, or a new ischemic event. The patient underwent cooling protocol with Arctic Sun but had to be aborted due to bradycardia. Dopamine and isoproterenol were used to improve the heart rate. Amiodarone was discontinued on 1/17, isoproterenol on 1/18, and dopamine on 1/20. The patient's neurologic function is poor, with no brainstem reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on 1/18, but currently has a gag reflex. EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain injury. The patient is not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis. The family has made the patient do not resuscitate (DNR).

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator after the cardiac arrest. Lung exam reveals rhonchi, chest CT shows mild pulmonary edema, and CXR is clear. The patient requires positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 14, pressure support (PS) 5, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and mediastinal hematoma. ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to the patient overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36). Morphine was given to decrease RR but had no effect.

3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever of 102 on 1/18, now improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8. WBC stable. The patient had a grossly infected urinalysis (UA) but negative urine culture. Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from 1/16 and 1/18 positive for coag-negative staph. Arterial line (A-line) and central lines were pulled on 1/20.

4. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. Urine output"
