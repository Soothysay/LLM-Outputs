 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   79M w/ pmh significant for SIADH, COPD, BPH s/p TURP, ulcerative
   colitis,  presenting with abdominal pain, diahrrea, leukocytosis, and
   severe hyponatremia.
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Appears euvolemic on exam but history suggestive of
   hypovolemia. Also, U NA 20 low for SIADH and suggestive of loss from
   GI/ poor PO intake as etology. Etiologies of SIADH  incl induced by
   pain, pulmonary disease, SSRI. Goal for correction in this pt is .5
   Na/hr or 12 in 24 hrs.  Cortisol 31 on admission so unlikely adrenal
   insufficiency. TSH also normal. Other possible causes of SIADH that
   should be considered include pulmonary disease(CXR here looks good but
   CT in past has showed some chronic unchanged nodules) and intracranial
   abnormality incl SDH
   -PICC placed so able to give hypertonic saline and per renal will start
   3% saline at 30cc/hr.
   -Check Q 4hr lytes.
   -rpt UNa
   -appreciate renal recs
   -check CT head today  given possible confusion and h/o falls at home to
   r/o this as life-threatening cause of SIADH
   - Regular diet without fluid restrictions for now.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Source most likely from urinary tract infection
   although also has diabetic foot ulcer.  Patient also with history of
   Ulcerative colitis and diverticulosis, however CT abdomen was negative
   for diverticulitis.
   -          cont Cipro/ flagyl but also adding Vanco today for foot
   -          f/u Urine and wound cultures
   .
   # s/p fall with poor rectal tone- Per urology, rectal tone not a side
   effect of TURP. Will d/w radiology any possible lumbal spine
   abnormalities seen on CT abd done in ED. If any question of
   abnormalities, will consider MRI lumbar spine
   .
   # Diabetic foot ulcer- Looks stage 3 here with some pus. Culture sent
   -f/u cx
   -Podiatry consulted
   -Vancomycin started to cover gram positive skin flora incl MRSA
   .
   # Incr CE- likely demand ischemia in setting of recent tachycardia
   without EKG changes but concerning given elevation of MBI and trop with
   falling CK
   - cycle CE today
   .
   #.BPH: s/p TURP, on tamsulosin. Will FYI urology today
   .
   #. Depression: holding fluoxetine given SIADH. Will need to investigate
   other possible antidepressants given then seems to be helping pt as
   well as risks of continuing it once Na has stabilized.
   .
   #.Hypertension: Holding lisinopril per renal, will use hydralazine PRN
   for BP control.
   .
   #.COPD: Continue albuterol
   .
   #.Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale, aspirin
   .
   #.Peripheral Neuropathy: Continue neurontin

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history significant for SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) status post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), ulcerative colitis, presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and severe hyponatremia. The patient appears euvolemic on examination but has a history suggestive of hypovolemia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 125/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is currently receiving hypertonic saline via a PICC line and will start 3% saline at 30cc/hr. His laboratory values show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 20 mEq/L, as well as leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL. The patient also has elevated creatinine levels and elevated cardiac markers (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's severe hyponatremia requires careful monitoring and treatment. Rapid correction of sodium levels can lead to osmotic demy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history significant for SIADH, COPD, BPH, ulcerative colitis, presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and severe hyponatremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for various conditions.

Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient has severe hyponatremia, which can lead to neurological complications such as seizures or coma if not corrected carefully. The sodium levels need to be corrected at a rate of 0.5 mEq/L/hr with 3% saline at 30cc/hr until the sodium level reaches 120.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is likely experiencing a UTI, which is indicated by leukocytosis. The source of infection could be related to his urinary tract, especially considering his history of diverticulosis and previous CT abdomen that was negative for diverticulitis. He will continue receiving antibiotics (cipro/flagyl) for this condition.

3. Depression: The patient is holding fluoxetine due to depression. It is important to monitor his mental status and provide appropriate support during his stay in the ICU.

4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed by holding lisinopril and using hydralazine for BP control.

5. COPD: The patient's COPD is"

   - started on hypertonic saline
   - was hypotensive in a.m. to SBP 80s, pulse 60.  Responded to 1L NS.
   Had three subsequent episodes of hypotension and was fluid responsive.
   However, urine osmoles still high and urine sodium low.  Talked to
   renal and outcome of boluses and urine lytes was that patient was in
   fact likely hypovolemic, as his pressures finally improved and urine
   osmolality fell, with a concurrent rise in serum sodium, after adequate
   volume ressucitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   79M w/ pmh significant for SIADH, COPD, BPH s/p TURP, ulcerative
   colitis,  presenting with abdominal pain, diahrrea, leukocytosis, and
   severe hyponatremia.
   #. Hyponatremia: Appears euvolemic on exam but history suggestive of
   hypovolemia. Also, U NA 20 low for SIADH and suggestive of loss from
   GI/ poor PO intake as etology. Etiologies of SIADH  incl induced by
   pain, pulmonary disease, SSRI. Goal for correction in this pt is .5
   Na/hr or 12 in 24 hrs.  Cortisol 31 on admission so unlikely adrenal
   insufficiency. TSH also normal. Other possible causes of SIADH that
   should be considered include pulmonary disease(CXR here looks good but
   CT in past has showed some chronic unchanged nodules) and intracranial
   abnormality incl SDH
   -PICC placed so able to give hypertonic saline and per renal will start
   3% saline at 30cc/hr.
   -Check Q 4hr lytes.
   -rpt UNa
   -appreciate renal recs
   -check CT head today  given possible confusion and h/o falls at home to
   r/o this as life-threatening cause of SIADH
   - Regular diet without fluid restrictions for now.
   # Leukocytosis: Source most likely from urinary tract infection
   although also has diabetic foot ulcer.  Patient also with history of
   Ulcerative colitis and diverticulosis, however CT abdomen was negative
   for diverticulitis.
   - cont Cipro/ flagyl but also adding Vanco today for foot
   - f/u Urine and wound cultures
   # s/p fall with poor rectal tone- Per urology, rectal tone not a side
   effect of TURP. Will d/w radiology any possible lumbal spine
   abnormalities seen on CT abd done in ED. If any question of
   abnormalities, will consider MRI lumbar spine
   # Diabetic foot ulcer- Looks stage 3 here with some pus. Culture sent
   -f/u cx
   -Podiatry consulted
   -Vancomycin started to cover gram positive skin flora incl MRSA
   # Incr CE- likely demand ischemia in setting of recent tachycardia
   without EKG changes but concerning given elevation of MBI and trop with
   falling CK
   - cycle CE today
   #.BPH: s/p TURP, on tamsulosin. Will FYI urology today
   #. Depression: holding fluoxetine given SIADH. Will need to investigate
   other possible antidepressants given then seems to be helping pt as
   well as risks of continuing it once Na has stabilized.
   #.Hypertension: Holding lisinopril per renal, will use hydralazine PRN
   for BP control.
   #.COPD: Continue albuterol
   #.Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale, aspirin
   # Peripheral Neuropathy: Continue neurontin
   #.Osteoarthritis: continue lidocaine patch and percocet

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history significant for SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion), COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) status post TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), ulcerative colitis, presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and severe hyponatremia. 

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line and initiation of hypertonic saline, which was stopped in the morning due to slow correction rate per surgery. The patient experienced episodes of hypotension and responded to fluid resuscitation. He also had a podiatry consultation for a diabetic foot ulcer and was started on vancomycin. An echo was performed, and the patient's urine osmolality and serum sodium levels improved after adequate volume resuscitation.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2143-2-21**] 08:00 PM. Infusions and other medications are documented.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current presentation. Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

   severe hyponatremia.
   #. Hyponatremia:  Patient
s urine osmolality was initially high
   (500-600) with a low urine sodium of less than 20.  We initially
   corrected his sodium with hypertonic sodium but also gave him NS
   boluses for hypotension, as he had risk factors for volume depletion at
   presentation (decreased po intake).  Other potential etiologies of
   SIADH include pain, recent surgery (TURP), pulmonary disease, and his
   SSRI.  Goal for correction in this pt is .5 Na/hr or 12 in 24 hrs.
   Cortisol and TSH also normal.  Sodium corrected more rapidly in a.m. of
   [**2143-2-22**] after total correction of hypovolemia, with a subsequent fall
   in urine osmolality and a rise in urine sodium.
   - goal sodium over 24 hours <= 124
   - PICC placed for 3% hypertonic saline but holding for now given
   improvement already
   - Check Q 4hr lytes
   - NS as needed for hypovolemia
   - f/u renal reccs
   - Regular diet without fluid restrictions for now.
   # Diabetic foot ulcer/?Abdominal infection:  Patient
s leukocytosis
   most likely from urinary tract infection although also has diabetic
   foot ulcer.  Patient also with history of Ulcerative colitis and
   diverticulosis, however CT abdomen was negative for diverticulitis.
   - cont Cipro for UTI and f/u cultures
   - cont vancomycin until foot cultures are negative
   - f/u podiatry reccs
   - will d/c flagyl
   # S/p fall with ?poor rectal tone:  Per urology, rectal tone not a side
   effect of TURP.  No evidence of acute spinal stenosis on abdominal CT.
   - continue to evaluate for any evidence of LE weakness
   #. BPH: s/p TURP, on tamsulosin.  Urology aware.
   #. Depression:  holding fluoxetine given SIADH. Will need to
   investigate other possible antidepressants given then seems to be
   helping pt as well as risks of continuing it once Na has stabilized.
   #.Hypertension: Holding lisinopril per renal, will use hydralazine PRN

   79M w/ pmh significant for SIADH, COPD, BPH s/p TURP, ulcerative
   colitis,  presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and
   severe hyponatremia.
   #. Hyponatremia:  Patient
s urine osmolality was initially high
   (500-600) with a low urine sodium of less than 20.  We initially
   corrected his sodium with hypertonic sodium but also gave him NS
   boluses for hypotension, as he had risk factors for volume depletion at
   presentation (decreased po intake).  Other potential etiologies of
   SIADH include pain, recent surgery (TURP), pulmonary disease, and his
   SSRI.  Goal for correction in this pt is .5 Na/hr or 12 in 24 hrs.
   Cortisol and TSH also normal.  Sodium corrected more rapidly in a.m. of
   [**2143-2-22**] after total correction of hypovolemia, with a subsequent fall
   in urine osmolality and a rise in urine sodium.
   - goal sodium over 24 hours <= 124
   - PICC placed for 3% hypertonic saline but holding for now given
   improvement already
   - Check Q 4hr lytes
   - NS as needed for hypovolemia
   - f/u renal reccs
   - Regular diet without fluid restrictions for now.
   # Diabetic foot ulcer/?Abdominal infection:  Patient
s leukocytosis
   most likely from urinary tract infection although also has diabetic
   foot ulcer.  Patient also with history of Ulcerative colitis and
   diverticulosis, however CT abdomen was negative for diverticulitis.
   - cont Cipro for UTI and f/u cultures
   - cont vancomycin until foot cultures are negative
   - f/u podiatry reccs
   - will d/c flagyl
   # S/p fall with ?poor rectal tone:  Per urology, rectal tone not a side
   effect of TURP.  No evidence of acute spinal stenosis on abdominal CT.
    - continue to evaluate for any evidence of LE weakness
   #. BPH: s/p TURP, on tamsulosin.  Urology aware.
   #. Depression:  holding fluoxetine given SIADH. Will need to
   investigate other possible antidepressants given then seems to be
   helping pt as well as risks of continuing it once Na has stabilized.
    #.Hypertension: Holding lisinopril per renal, will use hydralazine PRN
   for BP control.
   #.COPD: Continue albuterol
   #.Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale, aspirin
   # Peripheral Neuropathy: Continue neurontin

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history significant for SIADH, COPD, BPH s/p TURP, ulcerative colitis, presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and severe hyponatremia. The patient's sodium levels were initially low (118) and corrected more rapidly after total correction of hypovolemia, with subsequent improvement in urine osmolality and rise in urine sodium. The goal for sodium correction is 0.5 Na/hr or 12 in 24 hrs. The patient has been started on salt tabs and no fluids, and the PICC line has been placed for hypertonic saline but is currently holding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 137/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals mild LVH with hyperdynamic left ventricular global and regional systolic function, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and a very small circumferential pericardial effusion. The patient's mental status is altered, with confusion and hallucinations, for which he has been given 0.5 mg of haloperidol. The patient has a urinary tract infection, for which ceftriaxone has been initiated, and his Foley catheter is being considered for removal due to a resistant organism and long-term placement."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) status post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), ulcerative colitis, presenting with severe hyponatremia and altered mental status. The patient's current condition includes urinary tract infection, diabetic foot ulcer, and possible abdominal infection. The patient is also being treated for hypertension, depression, COPD, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and osteoarthritis. He is currently on various medications including hypertonic saline, ceftriaxone, haloperidol, tamsulosin, fluoxetine, lisinopril, albuterol, insulin, neurontin, lidocaine patch, and percocet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's severe hyponatremia requires careful management to prevent complications such as seizures, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's UTI needs to be treated promptly to prevent the progression of infection and potential complications like sepsis.
3. Diabetic Foot Ulcer: The patient's diabetic foot ulcer increases the risk of infection and potential complications such as cellulitis or osteomyelitis.

 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points. There is a combination of appropriate and
   inappropriate ADH release in this gentleman with Na down to 110 on
   admission without mental status change. He has had diarrhea and
   concerns regarding left foot ulcer. He is in pain in the back from
   falls sustained at home, all of which could have potentiated Na drop.
   He needs 3% NS and then fluid restriction with or without
   demeclocycline to keep SIADH component in check. He may also have a
   reset osmostat at baseline. His SSRI will be held and switched to
   another mood stabilizing [**Doctor Last Name 23**]. Podiatry consultation has been
   requested and head CT will be ordered to r/o intracranial pathology. He
   has agreed to PICC placement for short term he may leave ICU in next 24
   hours if he remains coherent and hemodynamically stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient presented with hyponatremia, confusion, and a 3% shut off.
- Fluid restriction was implemented, and the patient's condition was monitored.
- A trans-thoracic echo was performed at 09:48 AM on [date].
- The patient has no known drug allergies and received vancomycin and ceftazidime on [date].
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/66 to 155/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 98%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring showed total in of 2,432 mL, total out of 2,145 mL, and a balance of 287 mL.
- The patient required respiratory support but was not on oxygen delivery devices.
- Laboratory results indicated sodium levels ranging from 110 to 217 mg/dL, potassium levels ranging from 3.7 to 4.2 mEq/L, chloride levels ranging from 98 to 106 mEq/L, blood glucose levels ranging from 86 to 217 mg/dL, and creatinine levels ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 mg/dL.
- Other lab results included WBC count, Hct, Plt, Cr, TropT, PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, Lactic Acid, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4.
- Assessment and plan included altered mental status, hyponatremia, and urinary tract infection.
- The patient's condition was managed with 3% NS and fluid restriction, along with consideration for demeclocycline to control SIADH.
- Additional points mentioned included concerns regarding left foot ulcer, pain from falls, and potential reset osmostat.
- A head CT will be ordered to rule out intracranial pathology, and podiatry consultation has been requested.
- The patient agreed to PICC placement for short-term and may leave the ICU in the next 24 hours if coherent and hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe dehydration due to excessive fluid restriction.
2. Electrolyte imbalances, especially considering the patient's hyponatremia.
3. Development of kidney injury or acute kidney failure due to decreased renal perfusion or electrolyte disturbances.
4. Infection or worsening of urinary tract infection.
5. Pressure ulcers or worsening of the existing left foot ulcer.
6. Potential for delirium or worsening mental status due to various factors like electrolyte imbalances, infection, or underlying medical conditions.
7. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheter placement.
8. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to ICU stay and medication use.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
10. Potential for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction due to electrolyte imbalances or underlying heart disease."

","Summary:
- Patient is in the ICU with hyponatremia, which is now stable at 120.
- The patient is experiencing confusion and delusions.
- The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- Fluid restriction and salt tabs have been started to manage hyponatremia.
- Delusions could be due to delirium, lack of sleep, brewing infection, or acute withdrawal of SSRI.
- A podiatry consultation has been requested.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The patient may be considered for transfer out of the ICU if their mental status improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HypoNatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to various complications such as seizures, muscle cramps, weakness, and confusion. It is important to monitor and manage this condition closely.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): UTIs can lead to symptoms such as urinary urgency, frequency, pain, fever, and chills. In severe cases, it can progress to kidney infection (pyelonephritis) or sepsis. Appropriate antibiotics should be prescribed based on culture and sensitivity results.
3. Delusions: Delusions are a type of hallucination where a person believes in something that is not true. In this case, the patient's delusions may be due to delirium, infection, lack of sleep, or medication withdrawal. Monitoring the patient's mental"

   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points.
   1. There is a combination of appropriate and inappropriate ADH release
   in this gentleman with Na down to 110 on admission without mental
   status change. He has had diarrhea and concerns regarding left foot
   ulcer. He is in pain in the back from falls sustained at home, all of
   which could have potentiated Na drop. He needs 3% NS and then fluid
   restriction with or without demeclocycline to keep SIADH component in
   check. He may also have a reset osmostat at baseline. His SSRI will be
   held and switched to another mood stabilizing [**Doctor Last Name 23**]. Podiatry
   consultation has been requested and head CT will be ordered to r/o
   intracranial pathology. He has agreed to PICC placement for short term
   he may leave ICU in next 24 hours if he remains coherent and
   hemodynamically stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyponatremia. He has been experiencing confusion, and his sodium levels were initially low at 110. He has been diagnosed with altered mental status, hyponatremia, and a urinary tract infection. The patient is currently receiving 3% normal saline and fluid restriction, with plans to add demeclocycline to manage the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) release. He also has a possible reset osmostat, and his SSRI medication will be switched due to its potential contribution to hyponatremia. The patient's recent medical history includes diarrhea, concerns about a left foot ulcer, and pain in the back from falls. He has been prescribed pain medication and has agreed to a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line placement. Head CT will be ordered to rule out intracranial pathology. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is expected to be transferred out of the ICU within the next 24 hours if he remains coherent and hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications:
1. Worsening hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are still low, and if not properly managed, there is a risk of further decrease, which can lead to severe neurological complications.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has been diagnosed with a UTI, which needs to be treated promptly"

 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   79M w/ pmh significant for SIADH, COPD, BPH s/p TURP, ulcerative
   colitis,  presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and
   severe hyponatremia.
   #. Hyponatremia:  Patient
s urine osmolality was initially high
   (500-600) with a low urine sodium of less than 20.  We initially
   corrected his sodium with hypertonic sodium but also gave him NS
   boluses for hypotension, as he had risk factors for volume depletion at
   presentation (decreased po intake).  Other potential etiologies of
   SIADH include pain, recent surgery (TURP), pulmonary disease, and his
   SSRI.  Goal for correction in this pt is .5 Na/hr or 12 in 24 hrs.
   Cortisol and TSH also normal.  Sodium corrected more rapidly in a.m. of
   [**2143-2-22**] after total correction of hypovolemia, with a subsequent fall
   in urine osmolality and a rise in urine sodium.
   - goal sodium over 24 hours <= 124
   - per renal: d/c hypertonic saline, give salt tabs TID, fluid restrict
   today
   - Check Q 6hr Na
   - appreciate renal reccs
   # Diabetic foot ulcer/?Abdominal infection:  Patient
s leukocytosis
   most likely from urinary tract infection although also has diabetic
   foot ulcer.  Patient also with history of Ulcerative colitis and
   diverticulosis, however CT abdomen was negative for diverticulitis.
   - cont ceftriaxone for UTI and f/u cultures
   - cont vancomycin until foot cultures are negative
   - f/u podiatry reccs
   # S/p fall with ?poor rectal tone:  Per urology, rectal tone not a side
   effect of TURP.  No evidence of acute spinal stenosis on abdominal CT.
    - continue to follow for any evidence of LE weakness
   #. BPH: s/p TURP, on tamsulosin.  Urology aware.
   #. Depression:  holding fluoxetine given SIADH. Will need to
   investigate other possible antidepressants given then seems to be
   helping pt as well as risks of continuing it once Na has stabilized.
   For now, delusions/ hallucinations not c/w SSRI withdrawl
    #.Hypertension: Holding lisinopril per renal, will use hydralazine PRN
   for BP control.
   #.COPD: Continue albuterol
   #.Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale, aspirin
   # Peripheral Neuropathy: Continue neurontin
   #.Osteoarthritis: continue lidocaine patch and percocet

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of SIADH, COPD, BPH who presented with severe hyponatremia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and altered mental status. He was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and was given antibiotics. The patient's sodium levels were initially corrected with hypertonic saline, but then the goal was to correct it more gradually at a rate of.5 Na/hr or 12 in 24 hours. Fluid restrictions were implemented, and salt tabs were prescribed. The patient also has a history of ulcerative colitis, a diabetic foot ulcer, and a recent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). He is experiencing delirium and hallucinations, possibly related to his hyponatremia or medication use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: Rapid correction of sodium levels can increase the risk of seizures.
2. Cerebral edema: Rapid correction of sodium levels can also lead to cerebral edema.
3. Worsening UTI: Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient may develop complications such as pyelonephritis or sepsis due to the UTI.
4. Diabetic foot ulcer complications: The patient's diabetic foot ulcer increases the risk of infection or non-healing, which could lead to lower extremity ischemia or gangrene.
5. Hypertension: Holding lisinopril"

   severe hyponatremia.
   #. Hyponatremia:  Patient
s urine osmolality was initially high
   (500-600) with a low urine sodium of less than 20.  We initially
   corrected his sodium with hypertonic sodium but also gave him NS
   boluses for hypotension, as he had risk factors for volume depletion at
   presentation (decreased po intake).  Other potential etiologies of
   SIADH include pain, recent surgery (TURP), pulmonary disease, and his
   SSRI.  Goal for correction in this pt is .5 Na/hr or 12 in 24 hrs.
   Cortisol and TSH also normal.  Sodium corrected more rapidly in a.m. of
   [**2143-2-22**] after total correction of hypovolemia, with a subsequent fall
   in urine osmolality and a rise in urine sodium.  Now, pt likely close
   to baseline at 125.

s leukocytosis
   most likely from urinary tract infection although also has diabetic
   foot ulcer.  Patient also with history of Ulcerative colitis and
   diverticulosis, however CT abdomen was negative for diverticulitis.
   - d/c  ceftriaxone for UTI as urology thinks e-coli in urine cultures
   is likely a contaminant
   - cont vancomycin until foot cultures are negative
   - f/u podiatry reccs

   in at least 2 nights. Haldol .5 mg IV x3 overnight did not help. Will
   consider Trazodone for sleep in  future.  Need to continue to monitor.
   Pt has corrected Na appropriately so unlikely AMS related to this.
   # S/p fall with ?poor rectal tone:  Per urology, rectal tone not a side

   #. Depression:  holding fluoxetine given SIADH. Will need to
   investigate other possible antidepressants given then seems to be

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with significant past medical history including SIADH, COPD, BPH, ulcerative colitis, and diabetes mellitus. He presented with severe hyponatremia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and altered mental status. The patient was initially treated with hypertonic saline and normal saline boluses due to volume depletion. His sodium levels were corrected more rapidly after total correction of hypovolemia, with subsequent improvement in urine osmolality and rise in urine sodium. 

The patient also has a history of a diabetic foot ulcer and a urinary tract infection (UTI) suspected to be caused by E. coli. However, the urology team believes that the E. coli in the urine culture may be a contaminant, and they have discontinued ceftriaxone. Vancomycin has been continued until the foot cultures are negative.

Additionally, the patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation (AF) and did not convert to normal sinus rhythm with metoprolol IV. The etiology of AF is still under investigation, and the patient is being monitored closely.

The patient has been experiencing delirium and hallucinations, particularly during the day (sundowning), and has been given Haldol to help manage these symptoms. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of his altered mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hyponatremia. The patient has been experiencing delusions and agitation, particularly at night. He was found to have atrial fibrillation but was successfully converted back to sinus rhythm with IV and oral metoprolol. The patient has a history of altered mental status, depression, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate between 68-135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112-156 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,189 mL and output of 1,970 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 781 mL. Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mEq/L, as well as elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HypoNatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma if not corrected carefully.
2. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient experienced an episode of AFIB overnight, which was resolved with the use of metoprol"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient has hyponatremia with sodium levels stable at 125.
- Patient experienced overnight agitation with delusions, converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation with IV and po metoprolol.
- Patient has a history of altered mental status, but not delirium.
- Patient has urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ceftriaxone.
- Patient has a MRSA foot infection and is receiving vancomycin.
- Patient is fluid restricted and taking salt tabs.
- Patient's vital signs are within normal range, except for blood pressure which is on the higher end.
- Patient's respiratory support is not required as they are breathing independently.
- Patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned.
- Physical examination shows the patient sitting up in bed, eating breakfast, with no significant abnormalities noted.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HypoNatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need to be monitored closely to prevent complications such as seizures or neurological dysfunction.
2. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recent episode of atrial fibrillation needs to be monitored to prevent future occurrences, which can increase the risk of stroke or heart failure.
3. Delusions: The patient's delusions should be managed carefully"
