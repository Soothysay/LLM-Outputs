","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with an unknown etiology for acute respiratory collapse. She presented for an elective bronchoscopy but experienced respiratory arrest and ongoing hypotension requiring vasopressor support. She is currently in critical condition.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/51 mmHg to 164/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, sodium of 141 mg/dL, potassium of 0.5 mg/dL, chloride of 23 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 17 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 30.1%, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose of 90 mg/dL. Imaging reveals asymmetric elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with an ill-defined opacity in the right lower lobe, likely representing atelectasis.

The patient's medical history includes a potential respiratory arrest, hypotension, anemia, low urine output, cardiac enzyme leak, and gastroesophage"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman who presented for an elective bronchoscopy but experienced respiratory arrest and ongoing hypotension requiring vasopressor support. She has a history of right lower lobe collapse of unknown etiology. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/51 to 164/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and sedated.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 193 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 221 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging reveals asymmetric elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with an ill-defined opacity in the right lower lobe, likely representing atelectasis. The left hemithorax is clear without any abnormalities.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory arrest with no clear etiology. Possible causes include mucous plugging, pulmonary embolus, tension pneumothorax, myocardial infarction, flash pulmonary edema, or exaggerated medication response. The most likely process is aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia at the time of bronchoscopy leading to reactive hypotension.

During the procedure, she developed respiratory failure and required intubation. She was admitted to the CCU on pressors, which were weaned. A subsequent bronchoscopy while intubated showed no endobronchial lesion but did demonstrate secretions. Due to a decreased HCT, an abdominal CT was performed without evidence of retroperitoneal bleed, but multifocal pneumonia (PNA) was identified.

The patient's 24-hour events include continuing to require levophed overnight, being able to wean PEEP to 5, and thick/tan secretions. She has allergies to sulfonamides, penicillins, and codeine. Her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin at 08:00 PM on 10/30/2109 and levofloxacin at 09:00 PM on 10/30/2109. She is currently receiving norepinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include simvastatin, heparin prophylaxis, and famotidine.

The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are documented. Her ABG results show pH 7.19, PaCO2 67.4 mmHg, PaO2 55.4 mmHg, and HCO3 18 mEq/L. Her physical examination findings are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with chronic elevation of the right hemi-diaphragm who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of a possible endobronchial lesion. During the procedure, she developed respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was admitted to the critical care unit on pressors and subsequently underwent bronchoscopy while intubated, which did not reveal any endobronchial lesion but did show secretions. Due to decreased hematocrit, an abdominal CT scan was performed without evidence of retroperitoneal bleed, but multifocal pneumonia was identified. 

The patient continues to require norepinephrine support overnight and has been able to wean the PEEP to 5. Thick, tan secretions have been observed. The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, penicillins, and codeine. She was last administered vancomycin and levofloxacin on October 30th. The patient's vital signs remain stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/48-142/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,234 mL with outputs of 885 mL urine and 820 mL blood products, resulting in a balance of 2,349 mL. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 100%. 

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and bronchial breath sounds at the left base, regular rapid respirations, and minimal edema. Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Chest X-rays from October 29th to 31st show improvement in the infiltrates. 

Assessment and plan include hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia, for which the patient is being treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin. The barriers to extubation include persistent hypoxemia and secretions, with a plan to decrease FiO2 to 0.4, obtain a venous blood gas, and reassess the ability to perform a spontaneous breathing trial this afternoon if secretions improve and oxygenation stabilizes. 

The patient also has pneumonia, for which antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending. If clinical deterioration occurs, broad-spectrum coverage will be considered. Hypotension is present, possibly due to sepsis with pneumonia or other causes, with a central venous pressure of 11 mmHg. The patient is off levophed and will be monitored for volume responsiveness and cardiac output. Tube feeds"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   65F with chronically elevated right hemi-diaphragm; undergoing
   bronchoscopy for evaluation of possible endobronchial lesion by CT who
   developed respiratory failure during bronchoscopy requiring
   intubation.  She was admitted to the CCU on pressors which were
   weaned.  She underwent bronchoscopy while intubated without
   endobronchial lesion but did demonstrate secretions.  Because of a
   decreased HCT she had abd CT without an RP bleed, but did demonstrate a
   multifocal PNA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronically elevated right hemi-diaphragm. She underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of possible endobronchial lesion but was intubated due to respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU, requiring mechanical ventilation and showing signs of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient also has pneumonia (PNA) and has been on pressors. Her vital signs are stable, but she has decreased oxygen saturation and thick/tan secretions. The patient's blood work shows leukocytosis with a left shift, hyponatremia, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The assessment and plan include addressing hypoxemic respiratory failure, treating PNA with antibiotics, and evaluating for possible sepsis-related hypotension. The patient is critically ill and will remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection-related systemic response.
3. Barotrauma: The high peak inspiratory pressures during mechanical ventilation can cause barotrauma, leading to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
4. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The use of high tidal volumes or inappropriate ventilation settings can lead to VILI,"

   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds , ICU
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of mild-moderate mental retardation, chronic elevated right hemidiaphragm, aspiration pneumonias, and transferred from the CCU after respiratory arrest. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and hypotension (not shock).

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to V/Q mismatch during bronch in the setting of left-sided pneumonia and right-sided collapse. Mucous plugging is also possible. No pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumothorax on CT. Low blood pressure (BP) is not consistent with flash pulmonary edema. Bronchoscopy without evidence of intrabronchial lesion.

The patient is currently stable on minimal hemodynamic support treatment with Vancomycin and Levofloxacin; if decompensates, she will start cefepime. The goal is to wean the ventilator with the intention of extubation, possibly today given adequate respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) and tolerating spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

The patient's hypotension is likely related to respiratory arrest as above. Intubation may contribute to lower pressures. Sepsis is also a consideration given known pneumonia. Echocardiogram showed no intrinsic cardiac causes. Elevated cardiac enzymes likely myocardial stunning in the setting of demand. Normal lactate and mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) sat >70 yesterday."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure, hypotension, and anemia. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory arrest and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 120/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's current medications include norepinephrine infusion, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and antibiotics (Vancomycin and Levofloxacin). She is also receiving IV fluids to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) goal of >8 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 28.0%, platelet count of 193 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.05 ng/mL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26.4 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a chest X-ray that shows slight improvement on the right but little significant change. The microbiology reports indicate an E. coli infection in the urine culture and a positive MRSA screen. Blood and BAL cultures are pending.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of developmental delay who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure during a bronchoscopy and was diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia (PNA). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 123/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PSV/SBT mode, set at a tidal volume of 282 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient has been receiving norepinephrine infusion at a dose of 0.03 mcg/kg/min due to hypotension, which is suspected to be caused by sepsis or the effect of positive pressure ventilation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid volume. The patient has been extubated and is expected to continue weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.4 K/uL, elevated troponin-T levels, and slightly elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows stable bilateral basilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The urine culture grew E"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of developmental delay who was admitted due to hypoxemic respiratory failure during a bronchoscopy with multilobar pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The vital signs show that the patient's temperature is within normal range, her blood pressure is stable, and her heart rate is slightly elevated. Her respiratory rate is set at 30 breaths per minute, likely due to mechanical ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100% on FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has been experiencing moderate secretions requiring suctioning every four hours. She has been on norepinephrine infusion at a dose of 0.03 mcg/kg/min due to hypotension, which may be a result of sepsis or the effect of positive pressure ventilation. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid volume.

The patient has been receiving tube feeds, but they have been held for probable extubation. She is also on stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures have shown no growth. Imaging shows stable bilateral basilar infiltrates on chest"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and was intubated due to respiratory arrest. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the patient develops another episode of aspiration or if there is a worsening of the underlying lung condition.

2. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for E. coli, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). Treatment has been initiated with ceftriaxone. Additionally, the patient has pneumonia, as evidenced by the bronchial washings and respiratory culture showing commensal respiratory flora and yeast. However, the sputum yeast is considered a contaminant. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which could be related to the respiratory arrest or sepsis secondary to infection. The patient is currently off vasopressors, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any recurrence of hypotension.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has decreased from 37% to 29%, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia, such as bleeding or other underlying conditions. It is important to maintain the patient's Hct above 21%.

5. Cardiac Enzyme Leak: Although the suspicion for acute"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old non-smoking woman with mild-moderate mental retardation, chronic elevated right hemidiaphragm, aspiration pneumonias, and transferred from the CCU after respiratory arrest. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and she has been experiencing episodes of respiratory distress after extubation. She was unable to wean off the pressors but had episodes of hypertension with increased activity. Cortisol was added, but then the pressors were stopped at 3 pm without any issues. The patient's SOB worsened after eating, and hypercarbia developed, so she was started on BIPAP overnight.

The patient has a history of UTI, pneumonia, and anemia. The urine culture showed E. coli with >100,000 organisms/ml, indicating a significant bacterial infection. The bronchial washings Gram stain revealed 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms seen. The respiratory culture showed commensal respiratory flora and yeast, which were considered potential pathogens in amounts >=10,000 cfu/ml.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with mental retardation, who was admitted to the MICU after experiencing respiratory arrest during a bronchoscopy for an endobronchial lesion. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is a resident of a long-term care facility. She was extubated yesterday but had respiratory distress overnight after eating, likely due to aspiration or mucus plugging. A chest X-ray today shows reexpansion of the right upper lung with persistent chronic right lower lobe collapse. She is also being treated for left lower lobe pneumonia. Bronchial washings show normal flora and yeast, with no significant growth. The patient is currently off pressors and tolerating negative TBB. She has an e. coli urinary tract infection that is resistant to fluoroquinolones.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress overnight after eating suggests possible aspiration or mucus plugging, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, with ongoing treatment for left lower lobe pneumonia. There is a concern for chronic right lower lobe collapse.
3. Hypotension: The patient was previously on pressors but is now off them since yesterday evening. It is uncertain whether this is due to sepsis or the effect of positive pressure ventilation.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has an e."

   - NPO for now, repeat SLP eval given likely aspiration yesterday
   2.       PNA: bronchial washings with normal flora, no staph (as
   above); afebrile and with normal WBCs.
   -  Continue levofloxacin, d/cing vanco
   3.       Hypotension:  now off pressors since yesterday evening;
   suspect sepsis versus effect of positive pressure ventilation.  Now

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with mental retardation and a history of aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the MICU after experiencing respiratory arrest during a bronchoscopy for a suspected endobronchial lesion. The patient was intubated but did not show any endobronchial lesion, and she is now extubated.

The patient had respiratory distress after eating, with a VBG of 7.21/61 and a CXR showing right-sided opacification. She was started on BiPAP, which she is now off. The CXR this morning showed improvement. The patient was on levophed yesterday but is off pressors through the evening.

Her cortisol level was 6.8, and she has been receiving various medications including lorazepam, famotidine, heparin sodium, Atrovent nebs, simvastatin, and Ativan.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 143/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's flow sheet data shows hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. She is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 307 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with mental retardation who was admitted to the MICU following a respiratory arrest during a bronchoscopy for an endobronchial lesion. She is a resident of a long-term care facility and has a history of aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and is currently on BiPAP, but experienced respiratory distress after eating. She has been on and off levophed, and her blood pressure has stabilized. Her cortisol level is within normal range. The patient has undergone a speech-language pathology evaluation, recommending thin liquids and purees. She has allergies to sulfonamides, penicillins, and codeine. Her last dose of antibiotics was levofloxacin at 10:00 PM on 2109-11-1, and vancomycin at 08:00 AM on 2109-11-2. She is receiving various medications including lorazepam, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and required intubation. Although she has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and recent experience of distress after eating.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and multilobar pneumonia. Continued monitoring and treatment are necessary to manage the infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient required"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with mild-moderate mental retardation, chronic elevated right hemidiaphragm, and aspiration pneumonias. She was transferred from the CCU after experiencing a respiratory arrest. 

During her stay in the ICU, the patient had several events and conditions that need attention:

1. RESPIRATORY ARREST: The patient experienced an overnight event likely caused by a mucus plug. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax on CT, or intrabroncheal lesion during bronchoscopy. The patient is currently stable on minimal HAP treatment with Levofloxacin and will discontinue Vancomycin today.

2. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture, urinary agitation, and elevated white blood cell count. Therefore, she will be treated for a urinary tract infection with Macrobid for three days and the Foley catheter will be removed.

3. HYPOTENSION: The patient has low blood pressure, which may be related to the respiratory arrest. Intubation may contribute to lower pressures, and sepsis is also a consideration due to known pneumonia. An echocardiogram showed no intrinsic cardiac causes. AM cortisol levels were somewhat low yesterday. The patient is currently off levophed.

4. ANEMIA: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of mild-moderate mental retardation, chronic elevated right hemidiaphragm, aspiration pneumonias, and respiratory arrest. She was transferred from the CCU after experiencing a respiratory arrest. 

The patient continues to require frequent suctioning due to occasional mucous plugging and desaturation. She is currently stable on minimal HAP treatment with Levofloxacin, and vancomycin will be added if needed. 

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin but sensitive to macrobid. She will receive macrobid for three days.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and her urine output is good. She will continue to receive antibiotics as before and may require bolus as needed.

Her anemia is stable, and she will limit blood draws.

There is low suspicion for acute ischemia, and the cardiac enzyme leak is likely due to a hypotensive event. Cardiac enzymes will be monitored.

The patient is on ICU care, including nutrition (NPO pending speech and swallow evaluation), glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and multi-lumen central venous catheter.

The patient is on prophylactic anticoagulation with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin due to potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's code status is full"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old lady with mental retardation, resident of a long-term care facility, who was admitted to the MICU following a respiratory arrest during a bronch for a right-sided endobronchial lesion. She underwent CT angiogram and intubation without pulmonary embolism, but was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She is now extubated.

24-hour events include history obtained from the patient, family/friend, allergies to sulfonamides, penicillins, and codeine, and last doses of antibiotics (vancomycin and levofloxacin) on 2109-11-2. The patient is on heparin sodium (prophylaxis), famotidine (Pepcid), and other medications.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system, where there is decreased breath sounds on the left side. Flow sheet data as of 2109-11-3 shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 103 bpm (with a baseline of 79-107 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 122/35 mmHg (with a baseline of 96/27-166/71 mmHg) to 166/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (with a baseline of 18-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 90"

   69yoF with developmental delay; admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure during bronchoscopy, found to have multilobar PNA, now with
   increasing hypoxemia.
   1.       Respiratory Failure: extubated yesterday, then respiratory
   distress overnight after eating, likely [**12-24**] aspiration/mucus plugging.
   CXR today shows reexpansion of R upper lung with persistent (chronic)
   RLL collapse.  Also being treated for LLL pneumonia.  Bronchial
   washings with resp flora and yeast, no staff.
   - D/c vanco, continue levoflox for HAP for 8 day course
   - NPO for now, repeat SLP eval given likely aspiration yesterday
   - F/u ABG
 no known prior history of CO2 retention.
   2.       PNA: bronchial washings with normal flora, no staph (as
   above); afebrile and with normal WBCs.
   -  Continue levofloxacin, d/cing vanco
   3.       Hypotension:  now off pressors since yesterday evening;
   suspect sepsis versus effect of positive pressure ventilation.  Now
   tolerating negative TBB.
   - allowing to autodiurese

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with mental retardation, admitted to the MICU following respiratory arrest during a bronchoscopy for an endobronchial lesion. She was intubated and received mechanical ventilation, but no pulmonary embolism was found. She was extubated but experienced increasing hypoxemia, likely due to aspiration or mucus plugging. Her chest X-ray showed multilobar pneumonia, and bronchial washings revealed respiratory flora and yeast with no bacterial growth. She was on vancomycin, which was discontinued yesterday. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/35 to 166/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She has been on BiPAP overnight and is currently on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. Her physical examination shows rales at the left lung base and warmth without edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 169,000/mm³, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin T levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient is critically ill and requires continued ICU care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old lady with mental retardation who was admitted to the MICU following a respiratory arrest during a bronchoscopy for an endobronchial lesion. She is extubated but experienced respiratory distress overnight after eating, likely due to aspiration/mucus plugging. Her current condition includes respiratory failure, pneumonia in the left lower lobe, and possible chronic right middle lobe collapse. She also has hypotension and a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, which is resistant to fluoroquinolones.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of multilobar pneumonia indicate a high risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring and interventions such as respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia in the left lower lobe, which could lead to complications such as sepsis, abscess formation, or progression to multi-drug resistant organisms if not adequately treated.

3. Chronic Right Middle Lobe Collapse: The chronic collapse of the right middle lobe suggests a potential underlying condition such as bronchiectasis or malignancy. Further investigation may be required to determine the cause and guide appropriate management.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis secondary to the urinary tract infection or the effects of positive pressure ventilation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management are essential.

","The patient is a 69-year-old non-smoking woman with mild-moderate mental retardation, chronic elevated right hemidiaphragm, aspiration pneumonias, and respiratory failure. She was transferred from the CCU after a respiratory arrest. The patient continues to require frequent suctioning with occasional mucous plugging and desaturation. She is currently stable on minimal HAP treatment with Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin will be added if spikes.

The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to Macrobid. The prescribed treatment is Macrobid for three days.

Her hypotension has resolved, and her urine output is good. The antibiotics will be continued as above, and she will receive bolus as needed.

The patient has stable anemia, and blood draws should be limited.

There is a low suspicion for acute ischemia, and it is likely due to a hypotensive event. Aspirin (ASA) has been prescribed.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, as well as stress ulcer prophylaxis. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis is also being implemented.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is considered a potential call out to the floor."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old non-smoking woman with mild-moderate mental retardation, chronic elevated right hemidiaphragm, aspiration pneumonias, and a history of respiratory arrest. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and hypotension.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require fairly frequent suctioning with occasional mucous plugging and desaturation. This indicates ongoing respiratory distress and the need for close monitoring and intervention.
2. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient has an infection caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to Macrobid. The patient should receive treatment with Macrobid for a duration of three days.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, and urine output is good. The patient should continue with antibiotics as previously prescribed and receive bolus as needed to maintain blood pressure.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and efforts should be made to limit blood draws.
5. Cardiac Enzyme Leak: There is low suspicion for acute ischemia, and the cardiac enzyme leak is likely due to a hypotensive event. Aspirin (ASA) may be considered for treatment.
6. Lines: The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line inserted on October 29th and a 20-gauge line inserted"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of developmental delay who was admitted to the ICU after requiring intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure following a bronchoscopy. She had evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia (LL PNA) on chest CT, but has been improving overall. Overnight, she remained stable with no signs of mucus plugging and continued to receive 3L NC oxygen, maintaining adequate oxygenation. She was also weaned off pressors over the weekend.

Medical History:
The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, penicillins, and codeine. Her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin at 08:00 AM on 2109-11-2 and levofloxacin at 09:45 PM on 2109-11-3. She is currently on various medications including famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and simvastatin. She also takes albuterol/atrovent, macrobid, and ASA 81 mg daily.
