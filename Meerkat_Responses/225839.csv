   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements.  Upon transfer to the MICU had twitching movements of the
   legs combined with rigidity of legs>arms; somewhat improved this
   morning.  Preliminarily, neurology consult feels that clinical picture
   likely represents toxic-metabolic insult (i.e. hepatic encephalopathy).
   Will continue workup for underyling infectious etiology, including ? of
   meningitis, though does not appear that patient has been febrile at OSH
   or here at [**Hospital1 5**]. Serum and urine tox screens negative on arrival to
   [**Hospital1 5**].
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   - Prophylactically treating infection (meningitis, SBP, UTI) with vanc,
   ceftraixone.  Will add acyclovir for HSV prophy
   - Will LP today to r/o meningitis --> will need FFP prior to LP due to
   INR 1.7.  Ordered 2 un FFP; repeat INR prior to LP
   - Neurology consulted: feel most likely to be toxic metabolic, less
   likely meningitis or NMS/Serotonin syndrome
   - Possibly very severe hepatic encephalopathy; very elevated ammonia at
   OSH
   - Noncontrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process; follow up
   final read
   - Plan for EEG today
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - Repeating urinalysis/culture (UA negative at OSH), blood cultures for
   infectious process
   - evaluate abdomen for ascites and consider diagnostic paracentesis
   today if appears safe to tap ascites
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - avoid benzodiazepines unless necessary for sedation while intubated,
   currently using propofol
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - Obtain TFTs and RPR to rule out thyroid disorders or syphilis as
   causes of AMS
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Differential includes hypovolemia (versus infectious (though afebrile
   currently). Pt is s/p 2L bolus of NS with no resolution of
   tachycardia.  FeUREA suggest pre-renal even though she did not respond
   to boluses.  ? role of primary neurologic component though neurology
   believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other considerations include
   pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2 sats (though hypoxia not
   always present in PE); pericardial effusion, though no pulsus on A
   line.  Checked ECG that showed tachycardia but was otherwise similar to
   prior studies
   - Try another 1L bolus of NS
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider echocardiogram today or tomorrow if symptoms persist
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in
   OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and
   acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs
   # CODE: Full.
   # Contact: Brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
   # Dispo: ICU care for now (pt still intubated and on vent)

Physical Examination:
Peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, neurologic examination, and other physical examinations were not assessed.

Lab Results:
- White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 10.8 K/uL
- Hemoglobin (Hb): 11.9 g/dL
- Platelet Count (Plt): 90 K/uL
- Creatinine (Cr): 1.2 mg/dL
- Glucose: 204 mg/dL
- Other lab results are provided in the note.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being managed in the ICU with ongoing respiratory support, arterial line, and other interventions. They are receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's condition is stable, but they require close monitoring and further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and infections due to prolonged use of arterial lines and urinary catheters. The patient's elevated lactate level may indicate possible tissue hypoperfusion or infection. Monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and frequent reassessment of laboratory values will be crucial in managing the patient's condition and preventing complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice, with roving eye
   movements & twitching movements of the legs combined with rigidity of
   legs>arms. Neurology consult underway during transfer to the MICU and
   feel that clinical picture likely represents toxic-metabolic insult.
   Will continue workup for underyling infectious etiology, including ? of
   meningitis, though does not appear that patient has been febrile at OSH
   or here at [**Hospital1 5**]. Serum and urine tox screens negative on arrival to
   [**Hospital1 5**].
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   - Prophylactically treating infection (meningitis, SBP, UTI) with vanc,
   ceftraixone
   - Will LP today to r/o meningitis --> will need FFP prior to LP due to
   INR 1.7.  Ordered 2 un FFP
   - Neurology consulted: feel most likely to be toxic metabolic, less
   likely meningitis or NMS/Serotonin syndrome
   - Noncontrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process; follow up
   final read
   - eeg in the AM
   - treat for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - send repeat urinalysis/culture (UA negative at OSH), blood cultures
   for infectious process
   - evaluate abdomen for ascites and consider diagnostic paracentesis
   tonight if appears safe to tap ascites
   - complete abdominal ultrasound in the AM to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - repeat CXR in AM given concern for aspiration while patient was
   somnolent
   - avoid benzodiazepines unless necessary for sedation while intubated,
   currently using propofol
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Differential includes hypovolemia (now s/p small fluid boluses on the
   medical floor) versus infectious (though afebrile currently). ? role of
   primary neurologic component though neurology believes NMS/serotonin
   syndrome unlikely. Other considerations include pulmonary embolism
   though not hypoxic on arrival to floor (though hypoxia not always
   present in PE); pericardial effusion, though no pulsus on A line.
   -          check EKG
   -          cycle cardiac enzymes
   -          consider echocardiogram in AM
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in
   OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and
   acute illness.
   -          continue to trend creatinine
   -          add on urine lytes, will have to assess FeUREA given use of
   lasix at home
   -          monitor urine output closely
   -          consider renal ultrasound if not improved after IVF
   resuscitation
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Liver to follow in the ICU
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs
   # CODE: presumed full (documented in prior d/c summary), attempted to
   contact brother who is listed as HCP but no answer
   # Dispo: ICU care for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, remote intravenous drug use, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department with altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for airway control due to rigid, roving eye movements and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. The patient has a history of allergies to tetracycline and metoclopramide. She received ceftriaxone and vancomycin antibiotics. Her fluid balance is positive with a total input of 3,289 mL and output of 265 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and low albumin levels. Imaging shows no focal infiltrates on chest X-ray, but there is fullness at the hilar vessels. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise in this patient's case:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of HCV cirrhosis, she may be at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, remote intravenous drug use, and DM2. She presented to the emergency department with acute mental status changes and was transferred to the ICU due to airway control issues. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She is also on propofol for sedation.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 130 bpm and a blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient's temperature is within normal limits at 37.3°C.

The flow sheet data indicates a fluid balance of 3,289 mL in since 12 AM, with total input and output being equal at 3,289 mL. The patient has received a total of 0 mL blood products and has had minimal urine output at 265 mL. The respiratory support shows the patient on CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with set Vt at 400 mL, set RR at 16, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and SpO2 at 98%. The ABG results show pH 7.45, PaCO2 33 mmHg, HCO3- 21 mEq/L, SaO2 98%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 318.

The physical examination reveals the patient to be diaphoretic, with roving eye movements. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, and she exhibits stiff and rigid musculoskeletal movements. Neurologic examination is not fully assessed due to the patient being intubated.

The laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL, platelet count of 90 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.02 ng/mL, blood glucose of 204 mg/dL, and albumin level of 2.8 g/dL. Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile with PT/PTT/INR of 18.7/34.6/1.7, and electrolyte imbalances.

The imaging findings show a chest X-ray with no focal infiltrates and fullness at the hilar vessels. The ECG is normal with sinus tachycardia and no acute changes. The assessment and plan include acute mental status changes, acute respiratory failure secondary to neuro dysfunction, sinus tachycardia, and acute renal failure. The patient is suspected to have severe hepatic encephalopathy, but other differentials include seizures, meningitis/infection, or toxic/metabolic insults. The patient is being covered empirically"

   ------ Protected Section ------
   We had planned for bedside LP.  Pt has incision on LS spine and upon
   review of prior imaging of spine pt had fusion of L4-S1 with hardware
   in place.  Feel bedside procedure would not be optimal.  Will discuss
   with IR regarding fluoro guided procedure and talk with neuro regarding
   empiric CNS coverage as we added acyclovir to vanco/ctx, though pt ahs
   been AF, nl WBC, and we have low clinical suspicion for CNS infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, remote intravenous drug use, and type 2 diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU for acute mental status changes (AMS) and subsequently intubated due to worsening lethargy and unresponsiveness. The patient's symptoms include rigidity, roving eye movements, and possible seizure-like activity.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/76 to 161/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's neurological examination reveals roving eye movements and upgoing Babinski sign, indicating possible upper motor neuron dysfunction.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, prolonged PT/INR, low albumin levels, and elevated lactic acid levels. Imaging studies reveal no acute changes in the chest X-ray, but there is a fullness at the hilar vessels.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1) Acute Mental Status Change: Severe hepatic encephalopathy is suspected as the cause of the mental status changes. Other differentials include seizure, meningitis/infection, or toxic metabolic insult. Infection workup is pending, and empiric coverage for meningitis has been started.
2) Acute Respiratory Failure: Secondary to neuro dysfunction, the patient requires mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements and alternating twitching and rigidity on admission.  Likely
   [**3-19**] hepatic encephalopathy as NH3 very elevated.  Head CT shows no
   acute process.  TSH c/w SICU thyroid
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - IR guided LP to r/o CSF infection, will give FFP and platelets prior
   to LP
   - Follow EEG read
   - Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
   - Droplet precautions
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Sources include ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA.
   Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC with exception of VRE.
   This may also be a contaminant.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity; would add dapto if cultures show
   Enterococcus.
   - Will do abdominal tap this afternoon to r/o SBP
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Previous records show HRs consistently under 100.  Has come down
   slightly with aggressive IVF, but now 6L up.  FeUREA suggested
   pre-renal even though she did not respond to boluses.  Vigileo SVV is
   ~7, suggesting fluid replete.  Current tachycardia may be related to
   anxiety and fever.  Also ? role of primary neurologic component though
   neurology believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other
   considerations include pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2
   sats (though hypoxia not always present in PE); pericardial effusion,
   though no pulsus on A line.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia without
   non-rate related changes.
   - echocardiogram to r/o strain, endocarditis
   - continue to treat fever and anxiety
   # CBC:  All lines down in the setting of significant volume repletion.
   Vital signs not consistent with massive hemorrhage
   - Guiac stools
   - Recheck in PM to assess for stability
   - If continues to drop, would transfuse, r/o interabdominal/thigh
   bleeding with CT
   # Intubated: Goal to extubate once done with procedures for altered
   mental status w/o.  Favorable RSBI
   - Place NG tube for goal of d/c of OG tube
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving. Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per
   prior labs in OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of
   insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a
   pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   - Needs NG tube
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs
   # CODE: Full.
   # Contact: Brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
   # Dispo: ICU care for now (pt still intubated and on vent)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, likely secondary to her cirrhosis. The head CT showed no acute intracranial process, and an EEG is pending.

The patient has been treated aggressively for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin via NG tube. An IR-guided LP has been ordered to rule out CSF infection, and the patient is on respiratory precautions as empiric treatment for meningitis. Tube feeds have been started, and IVF has been given for tachycardia.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. There is also evidence of renal dysfunction with an elevated creatinine level. The patient's platelet count is low, but this is within her baseline range.

Other potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy exacerbation: The patient's altered mental status and elevated ammonia levels suggest ongoing hepatic encephalopathy. Continued treatment with lactulose and rifaximin is necessary to manage this condition.
2. Infection: The patient is being treated for suspected meningitis with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The presence of fever and GPC in blood culture suggests a possible bloodstream infection. Further evaluation with an abdominal"

   [**3-19**] hepatic encephalopathy as NH3 very elevated.  Head CT shows no
   acute process.  TSH c/w SICU thyroid
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with

   - IR guided LP to r/o CSF infection
   - Follow EEG read
   - Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
   - Droplet precautions
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Current coverage is sufficient.  This may also be a
   contaminant.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity
   - SBP is possible but holding off on tap of abdomen given
   thrombocytopenia.  Will do abd u/s
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Differential includes hypovolemia (versus infectious (though afebrile
   currently). Pt is s/p 2L bolus of NS with no resolution of
   tachycardia.  FeUREA suggest pre-renal even though she did not respond
   to boluses.  ? role of primary neurologic component though neurology
   believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other considerations include
   pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2 sats (though hypoxia not
   always present in PE); pericardial effusion, though no pulsus on A
   line.  Checked ECG that showed tachycardia but was otherwise similar to
   prior studies
   - Try another 1L bolus of NS
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider echocardiogram today or tomorrow if symptoms persist
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in
   OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and
   acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. She was admitted with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, including elevated NH3 levels and a head CT showing no acute intracranial process. The patient has been treated for hepatic encephalopathy, meningitis prophylaxis, and respiratory precautions. She is also being evaluated for other potential infections, including SBP and urinary tract infection. The patient has tachycardia, possibly due to hypovolemia or an infectious cause, and is receiving IV fluids. She has acute renal failure, likely related to hypovolemia, and her liver function tests are at baseline. The patient has a history of difficult-to-control blood sugars and thrombocytopenia. She also has diffuse pinpoint erythematous lesions on her skin, which appear to be chronic and may be a hypersensitivity reaction. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. Continued treatment with lactulose and rifaximin is necessary to manage this condition.
2. Infection: The patient is being treated for meningitis prophylaxis, and there are concerns about other infections such as SBP and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, which is likely due to her underlying liver disease. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy includes the use of lactulose and rifaximin.

The patient also has signs of infection, as indicated by fever and positive blood cultures. The blood cultures showed growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. Current coverage for infection includes Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Acyclovir. Additionally, respiratory precautions are being implemented due to the suspicion of meningitis.

The patient is experiencing tachycardia, which could be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or other causes. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

Acute renal failure was observed initially, but it is now improving. This improvement may be attributed to aggressive IV fluid administration and the pre-renal nature of the renal failure.

The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis, which is associated with thrombocytopenia and abnormal liver function tests. Monitoring of liver function and ongoing management of cirrhosis is important.

The patient has a history of difficult-to-control blood sugars, indicating the possibility of diabetes mellitus type 2. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements.  Upon transfer to the MICU had twitching movements of the
   legs combined with rigidity of legs>arms; somewhat improved this
   morning.  Preliminarily, neurology consult feels that clinical picture
   likely represents toxic-metabolic insult (i.e. hepatic encephalopathy).
   Will continue workup for underyling infectious etiology, including ? of
   meningitis, though does not appear that patient has been febrile at OSH
   or here at [**Hospital1 5**]. Serum and urine tox screens negative on arrival to
   [**Hospital1 5**].
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   - Prophylactically treating infection (meningitis, SBP, UTI) with vanc,
   ceftraixone.  Will add acyclovir for HSV prophy
   - Will LP today to r/o meningitis --> will need FFP prior to LP due to
   INR 1.7.  Ordered 2 un FFP; repeat INR prior to LP
   - Neurology consulted: feel most likely to be toxic metabolic, less
   likely meningitis or NMS/Serotonin syndrome
   - Possibly very severe hepatic encephalopathy; very elevated ammonia at
   OSH
   - Noncontrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process; follow up
   final read
   - Plan for EEG today
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - Repeating urinalysis/culture (UA negative at OSH), blood cultures for
   infectious process
   - evaluate abdomen for ascites and consider diagnostic paracentesis
   today if appears safe to tap ascites
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - avoid benzodiazepines unless necessary for sedation while intubated,
   currently using propofol
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - Obtain TFTs and RPR to rule out thyroid disorders or syphilis as
   causes of AMS
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Differential includes hypovolemia (versus infectious (though afebrile
   currently). Pt is s/p 2L bolus of NS with no resolution of
   tachycardia.  FeUREA suggest pre-renal even though she did not respond
   to boluses.  ? role of primary neurologic component though neurology
   believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other considerations include
   pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2 sats (though hypoxia not
   always present in PE); pericardial effusion, though no pulsus on A
   line.  Checked ECG that showed tachycardia but was otherwise similar to
   prior studies
   - Try another 1L bolus of NS
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider echocardiogram today or tomorrow if symptoms persist
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in
   OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and
   acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs
   # CODE: Full.
   # Contact: Brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
   # Dispo: ICU care for now (pt still intubated and on vent)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. She was admitted with twitching movements of the legs combined with rigidity of legs>arms. Neurology consult feels that the clinical picture likely represents toxic-metabolic insult (i.e., hepatic encephalopathy). 

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and being treated prophylactically for infection (meningitis, SBP, UTI) with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Acyclovir has been added for HSV prophylaxis. An LP is planned to rule out meningitis, and FFP will be used prior to LP due to an INR of 1.7. 

Neurology believes that the patient's condition is most likely due to a toxic-metabolic insult rather than meningitis or NMS/Serotonin syndrome. The patient has very elevated ammonia levels at OSH, and a noncontrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process. An EEG is also planned today. 

The patient is being treated aggressively for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube. Repeating urinalysis/culture and blood cultures for infectious process is recommended. An abdominal ultrasound is planned today to evaluate the liver parenchyma, ascites, and portal vein patency.

   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: toxic metabolic and UTI.  CSF and imaging
   negative.
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - Follow EEG read
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - will treat UTI, cont lactilose/rifamixin
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Sources include ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA.
   Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC with exception of VRE.
   This may also be a contaminant.  Insufficient ascietes to tap.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity; would add dapto if decompensating and
   cultures show Enterococcus.
   - Vanc/Ceftri
   - 10 day course for complicated UTI to [**11-9**]
   # Tachycardia: Has trended down over the past 24 hours, now under
   100.   Likely related to fever, anxiety.  Patient tachycardic to
   120-130s on arrival to ICU.  Previous records show HRs consistently
   under 100.  Has come down slightly with aggressive IVF, but now 6L up.
    FeUREA suggested pre-renal even though she did not respond to
   boluses.  Vigileo SVV is ~7, suggesting fluid replete.  Echocardiogram
   normal.
   - continue to treat fever and anxiety
   # CBC:  All lines down in the setting of significant volume repletion.
   Vital signs not consistent with massive hemorrhage.  Could also be a
   marrow suppressive effect of Ceftriaxone
   - Consider quinolone once speciated.
   - Guiac stools
   - Recheck in PM to assess for stability
   - If continues to drop, would transfuse, r/o interabdominal/thigh
   bleeding with CT
   # Extubated: ABG stable and good airway protection.  No need for
   reintubation
   # Acute renal failure:  At baseline today. Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8
   per prior labs in OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of
   insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a
   pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. LFTs, INR, platelets at baseline
   - Follow up liver
   recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted with airway protection due to altered mental status, which is being treated aggressively with lactulose/rifaximin. 

The patient has been febrile overnight and has shown signs of infection with GPC in pairs and chains on blood culture. The source of infection could be ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA. Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC, except for VRE. This may also be a contaminant. 

The patient's tachycardia has trended down over the past 24 hours, likely related to fever and anxiety. The patient's CBC lines are down due to significant volume repletion, and there is no evidence of massive hemorrhage. The vital signs are not consistent with massive hemorrhage, but it could be a marrow suppressive effect of Ceftriaxone.

The patient has acute renal failure at baseline today, likely related to hypovolemia in the setting of insensible losses and acute illness. Monitoring of urine output is crucial in this case. 

The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis and continues to receive lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient also has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2, and sliding scale insulin has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements and alternating twitching and rigidity on admission.  Likely
   [**3-19**] hepatic encephalopathy as NH3 very elevated.  Head CT shows no
   acute process.  TSH c/w SICU thyroid
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - IR guided LP to r/o CSF infection, will give FFP and platelets prior
   to LP
   - Follow EEG read
   - Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
   - Droplet precautions
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Sources include ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA.
   Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC with exception of VRE.
   This may also be a contaminant.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity; would add dapto if cultures show
   Enterococcus.
   - Will do abdominal tap this afternoon to r/o SBP
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Previous records show HRs consistently under 100.  Has come down
   slightly with aggressive IVF, but now 6L up.  FeUREA suggested
   pre-renal even though she did not respond to boluses.  Vigileo SVV is
   ~7, suggesting fluid replete.  Current tachycardia may be related to
   anxiety and fever.  Also ? role of primary neurologic component though
   neurology believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other
   considerations include pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2
   sats (though hypoxia not always present in PE); pericardial effusion,
   though no pulsus on A line.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia without
   non-rate related changes.
   - echocardiogram to r/o strain, endocarditis
   - continue to treat fever and anxiety
   # CBC:  All lines down in the setting of significant volume repletion.
   Vital signs not consistent with massive hemorrhage
   - Guiac stools
   - Recheck in PM to assess for stability
   - If continues to drop, would transfuse, r/o interabdominal/thigh
   bleeding with CT
   # Intubated: Goal to extubate once done with procedures for altered
   mental status w/o.  Favorable RSBI
   - Place NG tube for goal of d/c of OG tube
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving. Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per
   prior labs in OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of
   insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a
   pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   - Needs NG tube
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs
   # CODE: Full.
   # Contact: Brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
   # Dispo: ICU care for now (pt still intubated and on vent)
