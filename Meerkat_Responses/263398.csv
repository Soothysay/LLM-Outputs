","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He presents with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and cholecystitis, likely secondary to gallstone pancreatitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

24-hour events include receiving intravenous fluids without improvement in counts, planning for MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography), and experiencing infiltration in his right hand from an IV line.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. He is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, fentanyl for pain management, and other medications as needed.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 116 bpm with a baseline of 94-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/89 mmHg to 172/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute with a baseline of 25-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,703 mL and output of 650 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,041 mL. Respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery through"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 9310**] and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 10810**]
s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  The patient was transferred
   to [**Hospital1 54**] MICU yesterday evening for management of acute pancreatitis in
   the setting of presumed acalculous cholecystitis.  GI service is
   advising MRI to better assess pancreas, ducts, etc.  Meanwhile we
   given patient  significant fluid resuscitation.  He has some resp
   distress from baseline obesity, being rather supine, and now having a
   more distended, tender belly.   He has mild acidosis, mostly non anion
   gap, likely from his RTA from DM and mild renal insufficiency.  Lactate
   wnl.  None the less he
s having to overbreathe to PC02 of 33,  to
   compensate and get pH of 7.36.  He seems fluid resuscitated enough,
   given his hx of CAD and Chf, as U.O. is brisk and BP is elevated, if
   anything.  We
ll follow his CXR, lytes, calcium, lipase, etc closely,
   to be sure he doesn
t develop CHF, acidosis, hypocalcemia.  Right now
   he
s responding well to prn narcotics for pain, and he
s on Unasyn to
   prevent infectious complications from pancreatitis.
   45min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He was admitted to the MICU for management of acute pancreatitis in the setting of presumed acalculous cholecystitis. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 150/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the abdomen, positive RUQ tenderness, and right hand infiltration from IV. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. The patient's plan of care includes IV fluids, NG tube placement, NPO status, and administration of Unasyn for infection prevention. The patient will be evaluated for possible ERCP prior to considering surgery for cholecystitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, organ failure, and abscess formation.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient's presumed acalculous cholecystitis could progress to complications like gangrene or perforation of the gallbladder.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, which may worsen if fluid res"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He presents with symptoms consistent with gallstone pancreatitis and is currently being evaluated for possible ERCP prior to a cholecystectomy. The patient has leukocytosis likely due to inflamed pancreas, acute renal failure (ARF) possibly related to dehydration or underlying diabetes, tachycardia which is a baseline finding for the patient, obesity-related tachypnea, and uncontrolled hypertension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/89 mmHg to 132/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals sclera that are anicteric, clear oropharynx, supple neck with no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy, clear lung fields bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, mildly tender abdomen with positive right upper quadrant tenderness, and cold extremities with right hand infiltration from IV.

Laboratory findings include white blood cell count of 23.1 and 25.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 56.5 and 54.6 g/dL, plate"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity.
- He presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis, likely due to gallstone pancreatitis.
- Initial treatment included intravenous fluids (IVF) and nasogastric tube (NGT) placement, with the patient being nil per os (NPO) except for medications.
- The patient was started on ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) for now, but consideration will be given to removing the IV line once leukocytosis resolves.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to an inflamed pancreas, hemoconcentration, constipation, and dehydration.
- Acute kidney injury (ARF) is suspected, possibly due to dehydration or underlying diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently receiving IVF, and if the condition does not improve, further evaluation for urine electrolytes and protein will be conducted.
- The patient's tachycardia is believed to be at baseline and will be monitored after IVF administration.
- The patient's obesity and tachypnea may be related to body habitus or pain.
- Erythrocytosis is present, and the cause needs further investigation, possibly related to"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and cholecystitis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with tachypnea and poor saturation, primarily due to restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. The respiratory support provided includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen.

2. Pancreatitis/cholecystitis: The patient's pancreatitis appears to be partially necrosed with fluid collection. Treatment measures include intravenous fluids, nasogastric tube placement, and consideration for a nasojejunal tube for tube feeds. Further imaging, such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), may be required.

3. Leukocytosis: This condition is likely due to inflammation of the pancreas and hemoconcentration. It is expected to resolve with appropriate treatment.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is thought to be caused by dehydration, possibly exacerbated by underlying diabetes mellitus. Hydration therapy and medication dosing adjustments based on renal function are being implemented.

5. Tachycardia: This symptom may be related to the patient's baseline heart rate or a response to pain. Pain control"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Hypertensive to 160/100 --> no intervention.
   - Anxiety --> very anxious, given 1 mg Ativan
   - Elevated abd pressure --> bladder pressure 30-40
   - [**Doctor First Name **] Consulted: not abdominal compartment syndrome
   - GI Consult: Give fluids, staff later.
   - Delirium --> tried to get up, thought he was on a leather chair,
   wanted to be left to sleep but wanted to go ""back upstairs"".
   Thoughts:Ativan vs worsening medical conditiom
   - Tachypnea --> steadily worsening, desat from 95-90. Electively
   intubated for airway protection
   - Imaging --> renal function improved to 1.3 --> prehydrated --> CT
   ABD/PELV with double contrast -->
   1. Edema and peripancreatic stranding consistent with pancreatitis.
   Focal area of hypoenhancement involving the pancreatic neck and
   portions of the body and head, which are most consistent with early
   pancreatic necrosis.
   2. Edema within the duodenal wall and gallbladder likely reactive in
   nature.
   3. Indeterminant 3-cm cystic appearing lesion exophytic off the upper
   pole of the left kidney in addition to multiple bilateral simple renal
   cysts. A renal ultrasound or MRI may be obtained for further
   characterization the the 3cm
   indeterminate lesion as the patient's clinical condition warrants.
   4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent airspace disease
   likely representing predominantly atelectasis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and cholecystitis. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure due to abdominal expansion and pain, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, tachycardia, obesity-related tachypnea, erythrocytosis, hypertension, and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing tachypnea with poor saturation, which is likely due to restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. This condition may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Pancreatitis/cholecystitis: The patient has pancreatitis and cholecystitis, with unclear precipitants. The cholecystitis may be a result of backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. There is a concern for necrotizing pancreatitis.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to inflammation of the pancreas, hemoconcentration, and constipation. This condition is resolving with appropriate treatment.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing ARF, which could be caused by dehydration or underlying diabetes mellitus. Hydration and medication dosing adjustments may be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with HTN, DMII, HLD, morbid obesity, p/w findings c/w
   pancreatitis, need to be evaled for question ERCP prior to questionable
   surgery for cholecystitis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: tachypnea with poor saturation almost entirely
   due to restrictive physiology of abdominal expansion and pain
   - likely have to wait until fluid balance is negative
   - RSBI, SBT daily
   - obtain ABG, consider increasing PEEP given increased intraabdominal
   pressure
   .
   # pancreatitis/cholecystitis: Unclear precipitant. Cholecystitis likely
   from backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. Partially necrosed with
   fluid collection. His risk is very high - increasing CRP, falling
   calcium, respiratory distress
   - IVF, NGT placed, NPO except meds
   - NJ tube today
   - Meropenem, D1 = [**4-16**]
   - f/u GI recs re: TPN, surgery recs
   .
   # ARF: likely due to dehydration, could be due to his underlying DM.
   Resolving with hydration
   - IVF for now
   - trend cr
   - dose meds renally
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # leukocytosis - likely due to inflamed pancreas, hemoconcentration,
   constipation. Resolving.
   - trend
   .
   # tachycardia: per patient at baseline.
   - trend after IVF
   - clamp NGT; if tolerates, switch to home dose PO BB
   - uptitrate BB
   .
   # obesity/tachypnea: likely will have a component of body habitus, may
   be due to pain
   - pain control
   - getting ABG to see respiratory status
   .
   # Erythrocytosis: concentration + ? OSA or PCV. After falling with
   dilution, likely hemoconcentration
   - trend
   - outpatient follow up
   .
   # HTN: continue home med amlodipine, hold lisinopril due to ARF.
   - restart lisinopril after njt
   .
   # DMII: ISS
   .
   # hyperlipidemia: control with statins

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and cholecystitis, likely secondary to a backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, tachycardia, obesity/obesity-related tachypnea, erythrocytosis, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has poor saturation due to restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. This may require waiting until fluid balance is negative, conducting daily respiratory system compliance and breathing trial (RSBI) assessments, and obtaining arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis to determine the need for increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

2. Pancreatitis/Cholecystitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely caused by an unclear precipitant, with cholecystitis resulting from the backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. The patient has a high risk of complications, indicated by increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and falling calcium levels. Management includes intravenous fluids (IVF), nasogastric tube (NGT) placement, and nutritional support through a nasojejunal (NJ) tube. Antibiotic therapy with meropenem has been initiated.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to dehydration, which is resolving with aggressive hydration. Close monitoring of creatinine levels is necessary, and medication dosing should be adjusted based on renal function while avoiding nephrotoxins.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be attributed to the inflamed pancreas, hemoconcentration, or constipation. Regular trending of the white blood cell count is recommended.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate is consistent with his baseline status. After fluid resuscitation, the heart rate should be monitored and beta-blockers may be considered for titration.

6. Obesity/Tachypnea: The patient's tachypnea may be partly attributed to body habitus and pain. Pain management strategies should be implemented, and an ABG analysis should be performed to assess respiratory status.

7. Erythrocytosis: The patient's increased red blood cell count is likely due to hemoconcentration. Regular trending of the hematocrit level is necessary, and outpatient follow-up is advised.

8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be managed with continuation of home medication amlodipine, while lisinopril should be temporarily held due to acute renal failure. Lisinopril can be restarted after nasojejunal tube placement.

9. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's diabetes management should be closely monitored and optimized.

10. Hyperlipidemia: Control of the patient's hyperlipidemia can be achieved through the use of statins.

ICU Care:
The patient requires aggressive fluid resuscitation, repletion of electrolytes, and nutritional support through IVF and an NJ tube. Prophylaxis measures include subcutaneous heparin, pneumatic boots, and famotidine. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, who presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis. The patient's pancreatitis is likely due to cholecystitis caused by the backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. He has been experiencing respiratory distress, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, which are likely related to the pancreatitis and dehydration. The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to dehydration or his underlying diabetes. His condition is improving with aggressive hydration. Other issues include obesity, constipation, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin, and meropenem. The patient's family has been informed and is available for communication.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to the restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. It may be necessary to wait until the patient's fluid balance is negative to address this issue. RSBI and SBT should be performed daily, and an ABG should be obtained to consider increasing PEEP given the increased intraabdominal pressure.

2. Pancreatitis/Cholecystitis: The patient's pancreatitis and cholecystitis are likely due to the backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. This condition poses a high"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He presented with findings consistent with pancreatitis and cholecystitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory distress, likely due to a restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. He also has acute kidney injury (ARF), which is resolving with hydration, leukocytosis, tachycardia, obesity-related tachypnea, and hemoconcentration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Pancreatitis/Cholecystitis: The patient's pancreatitis and cholecystitis can worsen if not managed properly. Continued monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and close follow-up with the gastroenterology team are recommended.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's ARF needs to be closely monitored. Adjusting medication dosages based on renal function and avoiding nephrotoxins are important considerations.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing inflammatory response or infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be related to pain, fever"

   Consider esophogeal balloon to more closely estimate pleural pressure.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- radiographic evidence for necrosis.
   - tolerating hydration, now 11.5 L positive for LOS.
   - c/w unasyn, will switch to meropenem given necrosis
   - comanage with surgery, GI
   - trend lactate
   - would hold off on MRCP until discuss with GI/liver again. Normal
   Tbili and ALP
   General surgery to follow.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to hypovolemia, 3rd spacing from
   intraabdominal inflammation.  Continue net hydration.
   - improved substantially
   Acute respiratory failure
   - will be difficult to extubate with >11 L positive volume balance
   - PSV trials and wean as tolerated
   Leukocytosis - improving
   Sinus tachycardia
   - likely 3rd spacing +/- pain +/- underlying pancreatitis +/- BB
   withdrawal.
   - put back on home metoprolol

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient is sedated but responds to voice and communicates through nodding. A bladder pressure of 37 cm H2O was measured, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 cm H2O. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn) on 04/16/2142 at 08:55 AM and Meropenem on 04/17/2142 at 05:47 AM.

Infusions of Fentanyl and Midazolam are ongoing. Other ICU medications include Famotidine (Pepcid), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and changes to medical and family history. Review of systems reveals fever, an OG/NG tube, mechanical ventilation, distended abdomen, Foley catheter, hyperglycemia, anemia, and no signs of abuse or pain.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14, positive end-expiratory"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and requires immediate attention. Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating severe respiratory distress. This condition is attributed to severe intraabdominal inflammation and positive fluid balance.

2. Acute Pancreatitis: Radiographic evidence suggests necrosis of the pancreas. The patient requires supportive care, including hydration and antibiotics (meropenem). GI, ERCP, and general surgery will follow for further management.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to hypovolemia and third spacing from intraabdominal inflammation. Continuing net hydration is essential to improve renal function.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, likely caused by pain, hypovolemia, and b-blocker withdrawal. Monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented to manage this condition.

5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a positive fluid balance due to fluid resuscitation. It is crucial to monitor and manage fluid intake and output to prevent further complications.

6. Nutrition: The patient is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and hopes to start enteral tube feeds once the ileus resolves. Proper nutrition support is essential for the patient's recovery.

7. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating a need for strict glycemic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He was admitted to the ICU due to findings consistent with pancreatitis, possibly secondary to cholecystitis. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, tachycardia, obesity/tachypnea, erythrocytosis, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. It is likely necessary to wait until the patient's fluid balance is negative before considering mechanical ventilation. RSBI and SBT should be performed daily, and ABG analysis should be obtained. Increasing PEEP may be considered given the increased intraabdominal pressure.

2. Pancreatitis/Cholecystitis: The patient's pancreatitis and cholecystitis are unclear precipitants. Cholecystitis is likely caused by backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. The patient's risk for complications is high, as indicated by increasing CRP levels and falling calcium levels. The patient's current management includes IV fluids, NG tube placement, NPO status except for medications, and initiation of meropenem antibiotic therapy. Further evaluation and consultation with gastroenterology are recommended.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient likely has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. The patient was admitted with findings consistent with pancreatitis and cholecystitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has tachypnea with poor saturation due to restrictive physiology of abdominal expansion and pain. This may be due to the increased intraabdominal pressure from the inflamed pancreas and associated fluid collection.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. This could be due to dehydration or underlying diabetes mellitus.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be a response to inflammation of the pancreas or hemoconcentration.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has a persistent high heart rate, which may be due to pain or as a baseline condition. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's pain and adjust medication dosages accordingly.

5. Obesity/Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient's obesity may contribute to respiratory distress and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has an elevated blood glucose level, indicating poor glycemic control. This needs to be managed and titrated accordingly.

7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's high lipid levels need to be controlled with statins.

8. Erythrocytosis: The patient has an increased red blood cell count, possibly due to hemoconcentration or underlying conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea or polycythemia vera.

9. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be managed with medication and lifestyle modifications.

10. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, indicating a possible ongoing infection that needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information, and further evaluation and testing may be required for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to severe intraabdominal
   inflammation, positive fluid balance in context of fluid resusitation.
   Consider esophogeal balloon to more closely estimate pleural pressure.
   Eventually work towards SBT once able to allow net diuresis towards dry
   weight.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- radiographic evidence for necrosis.  Continue
   supportive care including hydration (3rd spacing), meropenem.  GI, ERCP
   and General surgery to follow.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to hypovolemia, 3rd spacing from
   intraabdominal inflammation.  Improved.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Sinus tachycardia, attributed to pain, hyovolemia,
   b-blocker withdrawal.  Improved with gradual resumption of usual
   b-blocker medication.  Monitor.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 increased, likely attributed to pancreatitis.  Monitor
   glucose, maintain <150.
   FLUIDS
 Total body expanded, intravascularly replete (CVP= 14).  Hope
   to allow net volume reduction (1-2 L/24 hrs), mobilization if
   tolerates.  Monitor UO.
   NUTRITION
 TPN.  Hope to start tropic tube feeds once ileus resolves.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient remains febrile and has significant nasogastric output. They have been sedated but arrousal, appropriate, and unable to provide a history due to being on endotracheal tube (ETT). The patient has allergies to penicillins, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 123 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/61 mmHg to 155/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, indicating adequate intravascular volume. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and blood glucose levels. The creatinine level is elevated, suggesting acute renal failure. The liver function tests are within normal range, as well as electrolyte levels. 

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure attributed to severe intraabdominal inflammation, acute pancreatitis with evidence of necrosis, and acute renal failure due to hypovolemia and 3rd spacing from intraabdominal inflammation. The patient also has sinus tachycardia, likely due to pain, hypovolemia, and beta-blocker withdrawal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to severe intraabdominal inflammation and positive fluid balance. There is a concern for further deterioration in respiratory status if the underlying cause is not addressed.

2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of necrotic pancreatitis. If left untreated, this can lead to complications such as infection, abscess formation, and systemic spread of infection.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is attributed to hypovolemia and 3rd spacing from intraabdominal inflammation. If not managed properly, this can lead to further deterioration in kidney function and potential need for renal replacement therapy.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which could be a sign of pain, hypovolemia, or withdrawal from beta-blocker medication. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia, likely secondary to acute pancreatitis. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and complications.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) involving the respiratory, pancreatic, renal, and endocrine systems. Immediate attention to the underlying causes and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters are crucial to prevent further deterioration and potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to severe intraabdominal
   inflammation, positive fluid balance in context of fluid resusitation.
   Consider esophogeal balloon to more closely estimate pleural pressure.
   Eventually work towards SBT once able to allow net diuresis towards dry
   weight.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- radiographic evidence for necrosis.  Continue
   supportive care including hydration (3rd spacing), meropenem.  GI, ERCP
   and General surgery to follow.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to hypovolemia, 3rd spacing from
   intraabdominal inflammation.  Improved.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Sinus tachycardia, attributed to pain, hyovolemia,
   b-blocker withdrawal.  Improved with gradual resumption of usual
   b-blocker medication.  Monitor.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 increased, likely attributed to pancreatitis.  Monitor
   glucose, maintain <150.
   FLUIDS
 Total body expanded, intravascularly replete (CVP= 14).  Hope
   to allow net volume reduction (1-2 L/24 hrs), mobilization if
   tolerates.  Monitor UO.
   NUTRITION
 TPN.  Hope to start tropic tube feeds once ileus resolves.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 123 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is febrile and has significant nasogastric (NG) output.

The patient's medical history includes severe intraabdominal inflammation, acute pancreatitis with radiographic evidence of necrosis, and acute renal failure attributed to hypovolemia and third spacing from intraabdominal inflammation. The patient also has sinus tachycardia likely due to pain, hypovolemia, and beta-blocker withdrawal. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, likely due to pancreatitis.

The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total body expansion and intravascular repletion. The plan is to allow net volume reduction of 1-2 liters per 24 hours and mobilization if tolerated. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been started, and enteral tube feeds will be initiated once ileus resolves.

The patient is on systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and respiratory system infection (VAP) prevention measures such as head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with HTN, DMII, HLD, morbid obesity, p/w findings c/w
   pancreatitis, need to be evaled for question ERCP prior to questionable
   surgery for cholecystitis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: tachypnea with poor saturation almost entirely
   due to restrictive physiology of abdominal expansion and pain
   - likely have to wait until fluid balance is negative, will administer
   lasix with goal net negative 2 L today, check PM lytes
   - RSBI, SBT daily
   - wean sedation
   - continue current vent settings with goal to decrease PEEP, FIO2
   .
   # pancreatitis/cholecystitis: Unclear precipitant. Cholecystitis likely
   from backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. Partially necrosed with
   fluid collection. His risk is very high - increasing CRP, falling
   calcium, respiratory distress.  No bowel sounds this AM with continued
   drainage from NG tube
 patient not ready to start PO feeds.
   - IVF, NGT placed, NPO except meds, continue TPN
   - NG tube clamp trial today
   - Meropenem, D1 = [**4-16**]
   - f/u GI recs re: TPN, surgery recs
   .
   # ARF: likely due to dehydration, could be due to his underlying DM.
   Resolving with hydration
   - IVF for now
   - trend cr
   - dose meds renally
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # leukocytosis - likely due to inflamed pancreas, hemoconcentration,
   constipation. Resolving.
   - trend
   .
   # tachycardia: persistent although pt reports tachycardia at baseline.
   - clamp NGT; if tolerates, switch to home dose PO BB
   - continue lopressor at 15 mg IV Q4H
   .
   #hypocalcemia
 calcium trending down since administration of lasix
   -check albumin
   -continue to monitor for symptoms
   .
   # DMII: BG 265 today, will uptitrate RISS for goal <150
   .
   # obesity/tachypnea: likely will have a component of body habitus, may
   be due to pain
   - pain control
   .
   # Erythrocytosis: concentration + ? OSA or PCV. After falling with
   dilution, likely hemoconcentration
   - trend
   - outpatient follow up
   .
   # HTN: continue home med amlodipine, hold lisinopril due to ARF.
   - restart lisinopril after njt
   .
   # hyperlipidemia: control with statins
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, and recent findings consistent with pancreatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for suspected cholecystitis.

From the progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has tachypnea with poor saturation due to restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. This may require careful monitoring and management of respiratory support.

2. Pancreatitis/cholecystitis: The patient has pancreatitis with necrosis and fluid collection, likely secondary to cholecystitis. The risk of complications such as infection or abscess formation is high. Surgical intervention may be necessary.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, which could be due to dehydration or underlying diabetes mellitus. Hydration with intravenous fluids is being provided, and medication dosing will be adjusted based on renal function.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is likely due to inflammation of the pancreas and hemoconcentration. This should be monitored and trended.

5. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, possibly related to pain or underlying conditions like hypertension. Pain control and adjustment of medication doses may be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with HTN, DMII, HLD, morbid obesity, p/w findings c/w
   pancreatitis, need to be evaled for question ERCP prior to questionable
   surgery for cholecystitis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: tachypnea with poor saturation almost entirely
   due to restrictive physiology of abdominal expansion and pain
   - likely have to wait until fluid balance is negative, will administer
   lasix with goal net negative 2 L today, check PM lytes
   - RSBI, SBT daily
   - wean sedation
   - continue current vent settings with goal to decrease PEEP, FIO2
   .
   # pancreatitis/cholecystitis: Unclear precipitant. Cholecystitis likely
   from backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. Partially necrosed with
   fluid collection. His risk is very high - increasing CRP, falling
   calcium, respiratory distress.  No bowel sounds this AM with continued
   drainage from NG tube
 patient not ready to start PO feeds.
   - IVF, NGT placed, NPO except meds, continue TPN
   - NG tube clamp trial today
   - Meropenem, D1 = [**4-16**]
   - f/u GI recs re: TPN, surgery recs
   .
   # ARF: likely due to dehydration, could be due to his underlying DM.
   Resolving with hydration
   - IVF for now
   - trend cr
   - dose meds renally
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # leukocytosis - likely due to inflamed pancreas, hemoconcentration,
   constipation. Resolving.
   - trend
   .
   # tachycardia: persistent although pt reports tachycardia at baseline.
   - clamp NGT; if tolerates, switch to home dose PO BB
   - continue lopressor at 15 mg IV Q4H
   .
   #hypocalcemia
 calcium trending down since administration of lasix
   -check albumin
   -continue to monitor for symptoms
   .
   # DMII: BG 265 today, will uptitrate RISS for goal <150
   .
   # obesity/tachypnea: likely will have a component of body habitus, may
   be due to pain
   - pain control
   .
   # Erythrocytosis: concentration + ? OSA or PCV. After falling with
   dilution, likely hemoconcentration
   - trend
   - outpatient follow up
   .
   # HTN: continue home med amlodipine, hold lisinopril due to ARF.
   - restart lisinopril after njt
   .
   # hyperlipidemia: control with statins

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis and possible cholecystitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments, including IV fluids, antibiotics, pain management, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing tachypnea with poor saturation due to restrictive physiology of abdominal expansion and pain. This may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly. The plan is to administer lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance, monitor electrolytes, and continue current ventilator settings with the goal of decreasing PEEP and FiO2.

2. Pancreatitis/Cholecystitis: The patient's pancreatitis may be complicated by cholecystitis due to backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. This condition is partially necrosed with fluid collection, posing a high risk for the patient. The plan includes IVF, NGT placement, NPO except for medications, and continuing TPN. A trial of NG tube clamping is planned today.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has ARF due to dehydration and possibly underlying diabetes mellitus. The condition is resolving with hydration, and the plan is to continue IVF for now, trend creatinine, dose medications appropriately,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis, possibly secondary to cholecystitis. The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. There is evidence of acute kidney injury (ARF) with a stable creatinine level of 1.1, and the patient requires close monitoring of renal function. The patient also has leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, and tachycardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is primarily due to restrictive physiology caused by abdominal expansion and pain. It is important to wait until the patient's fluid balance is negative before attempting to wean from the ventilator.
2. Pancreatitis/cholecystitis: The patient has necrotic pancreatitis with a high risk of complications. There is a need for further evaluation for possible endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) prior to considering surgery for cholecystitis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.1, indicating some degree of renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with HTN, DMII, HLD, morbid obesity, p/w findings c/w
   pancreatitis, need to be evaled for question ERCP prior to questionable
   surgery for cholecystitis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: tachypnea with poor saturation almost entirely
   due to restrictive physiology of abdominal expansion and pain
   - likely have to wait until fluid balance is negative, will administer
   lasix with goal net negative 2 L today, check PM lytes
   - RSBI, SBT daily
   - wean sedation
   - continue current vent settings with goal to decrease PEEP, FIO2
   .
   # pancreatitis/cholecystitis: Unclear precipitant. Cholecystitis likely
   from backwash of inflammatory pancreatic fluid. Partially necrosed with
   fluid collection. His risk is very high - increasing CRP, falling
   calcium, respiratory distress.  No bowel sounds this AM with continued
   drainage from NG tube
 patient not ready to start PO feeds.
   - IVF, NGT placed, NPO except meds, continue TPN
   - NG tube clamp trial today
   - Meropenem, D1 = [**4-16**]
   - f/u GI recs re: TPN, surgery recs
   .
   # ARF: Stable Cr of 1.1 currently.
   - steady diuresis with lasix
   - trend Cr
   - dose meds renally
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # leukocytosis - likely due to inflamed pancreas, hemoconcentration,
   constipation.  Continues to downtrend.
   - trend
   .
   # tachycardia: persistent although pt reports tachycardia at baseline.
   - clamp NGT; if tolerates, switch to home dose PO BB
   - continue lopressor at 15 mg IV Q4H
   .
   #hypocalcemia
 calcium trending down since administration of lasix
   - ionized Ca WNL; continue to trend
   - continue to monitor for symptoms
   .
   # DMII: BG 265 today, will uptitrate insulin in TPN.
   .
   # obesity/tachypnea: likely will have a component of body habitus, may
   be due to pain
   - pain control
   .
   # Erythrocytosis: concentration + ? OSA or PCV. After falling with
   dilution, likely hemoconcentration
   - trend
   - outpatient follow up
   .
   # HTN: continue home med amlodipine, hold lisinopril due to ARF.
   - restart lisinopril
   .
   # hyperlipidemia: control with statins
   .
   FEN: TPN, replete electrolytes, NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. He was admitted to the ICU due to pancreatitis, and further evaluation revealed cholecystitis as well. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 122/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's abdomen is mildly tender and non-distended, with absent bowel sounds. He has leukocytosis and hypocalcemia, which are being trended. The patient's glucose level is elevated, and insulin is being uptitrated in his total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He is also on diuretics for fluid balance management and prophylactic antibiotics for infection prevention. The patient's next-of-kin is a sister, and his code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress could progress to respiratory failure if his restrictive physiology worsens or if his lungs become compromised.
2. Pancreatitis/Cholecystitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to severe intraabdominal
   inflammation, positive fluid balance in context of fluid resusitation.
   Consider esophogeal balloon to more closely estimate pleural pressure.
   Eventually work towards SBT once able to allow net diuresis towards dry
   weight.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- radiographic evidence for necrosis.  Continue
   supportive care including hydration (3rd spacing), meropenem.  GI, ERCP
   and General surgery to follow.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to hypovolemia, 3rd spacing from
   intraabdominal inflammation.  Improved.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Sinus tachycardia, attributed to pain, hyovolemia,
   b-blocker withdrawal.  Improved with gradual resumption of usual
   b-blocker medication.  Monitor.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 increased, likely attributed to pancreatitis.  Monitor
   glucose, maintain <150.
   FLUIDS
 Total body expanded, intravascularly replete (CVP= 14).  Hope
   to allow net volume reduction (1-2 L/24 hrs), mobilization if
   tolerates.  Monitor UO.
   NUTRITION
 TPN.  Hope to start tropic tube feeds once ileus resolves.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, tachycardia, hyperglycemia, and fluid overload. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/65 mmHg to 137/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes. The patient's renal function is impaired, with elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The patient's glucose levels are also elevated. The patient has a positive fluid balance and is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive fluid balance may indicate an underlying infection. The risk of developing sepsis or septic shock is present.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's impaired renal function, indicated"
