","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with urosepsis. The patient has been on dobutamine and norepinephrine, indicating the presence of hemodynamic instability. The patient's INR was found to be very high at 16, so vitamin K was administered. The patient's creatinine levels have improved significantly with IVF (>6L). The patient had significant ectopy overnight and is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, cefipime, vancomycin, and norepinephrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's need for dobutamine and norepinephrine suggests ongoing hemodynamic instability, which may indicate the risk of cardiac arrest or organ dysfunction.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR of 16 indicates a significant bleeding risk. This could lead to spontaneous bleeding or increased risk during invasive procedures.
3. Acute kidney injury: Although the patient's creatinine levels have improved with IVF, there is still a concern for ongoing kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury due to sepsis and potential nephrotoxic medications.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of respiratory infection and adjusting the ventilator settings accordingly will be important.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with urosepsis.
   .
   1. Urosepsis.  Patient presents with positive UA, fever, elevated WBC,
   and radiographic evidence of pylonephritis.   Patient was hypotensive
   requiring levophed and dobutamine, but has been weaned off dobuta and
   has titrated down levophed. Normal random cortisol level
   - Levophed to maintain MAPS >65; dobutamine if necessary
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - cefepime/vanco for broad coverage (will need to be adjusted for renal
   fucntion)
   - monitor urine output
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema.  Patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to
   significant fluid boluses.  Serial blood gas shows combined metabaolic
   acidosis and respiratory alkalsosis with adequate oxygenation.
   - continue mechanical ventillation with effort to normalize pH
   - serial CXR
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   3.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheuamtic fever.
   - hold lasix, aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   .
   4.  Rhythmn.  Patient having significant ectopy on telemetry,
   particularly while on dobutamine.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   5. Elevated INR.  Patient has a history of mitral valve replacement and
   A. fib so is anticoatulated with coumadin.  INR continues to rise
   suspect secondary to medications, but will evaluate for DIC.  Patient
   given 2.5 mg PO of vit K today.  Patient has history of HIT so if she
   has subtherapuetic inr in the future, will be unable to bridge with
   heparin.  Her mechanical valve and a. fib are strong indications for
   anticoagulation.
   - hold coumadin
   - give 2.5 mg po vitamin k and follow serial INR
   - follow PT, PTT, INR
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   .
   6.  Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis.  Patient noted to have a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis on lab.  Patient initially presented
   with diarrhea, however, acidosis developed in setting of aggressive IVF
   so likely due to this.  Will switch to LR for fluids now.
   - follow gap
   - LR instead of NS
   .
   7.  ARF.  Patient noted to have Cr of 3.0 on admission with baseline Cr
   of 1.0.  Creatinine is already improving with IVF suggesting an
   pre-renal component.  No signs of hydronephrosis on catcan.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - follow Cr
   - pressors to maintain MAPS > 65
   - hold lasix, lisinopril, aldactone
   - renally dose all antibiotics
   .
   8.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly)
   .
   9. Depression.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with urosepsis and presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. 

The patient was initially hypotensive and required levophed and dobutamine support, but has since been weaned off dobutamine and titrated down levophed. Her random cortisol level is normal. She remains intubated for respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. 

Her recent echo shows an ejection fraction of 10% indicating severe left ventricular dysfunction. She also has a history of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. 

The patient has significant ectopy on telemetry, particularly while on dobutamine, and has an ICD in place. 

Her INR is elevated, likely secondary to medications, but further evaluation for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is needed. She has a history of mitral valve replacement and atrial fibrillation, both of which are indications for anticoagulation. 

The patient also has non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to aggressive intravenous fluid administration, and acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.0, which is improving with intravenous fluids"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), previous mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. The patient was admitted with urosepsis and presents with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis.

The patient required levophed and dobutamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg due to hypotension, but both medications have been weaned off. The patient's random cortisol level is normal, so there is no need for steroids.

The patient also has respiratory failure, which necessitated intubation for tachypnea and increased work of breathing. The chest X-ray shows significant cardiomegaly but no significant pulmonary pathology. The patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to significant fluid boluses. Initial blood gas shows combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for the following:

1. Urosepsis: The patient's condition indicates an ongoing infection in the urinary tract that has spread to the bloodstream. It is important to continue aggressive treatment with antibiotics and monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely.

2. Hypotension: Despite weaning off dobutamine and levophed, the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with diarrhea and was found to be hypotensive in septic shock, likely from a urinary source. She has been admitted to the ICU and received multiple interventions including invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and fluid resuscitation. The patient's vital signs have improved overnight, with a decrease in the use of vasoactive medications. However, she remains critically ill with several potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by low blood pressure and inadequate tissue perfusion. Although her condition has improved, there is still a risk of recurrent shock due to ongoing infection or other factors.

2. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including fever and diarrhea. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is important to identify the causative organism and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's initial laboratory values show elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible pre-renal acute kidney injury due to hypotension and poor perfusion. Her renal function has improved with fluid resuscitation, but close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her ABG results suggest metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis. Oxygenation is adequate, but she may require further adjustments in ventilatory"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with urosepsis.
   .
   1. Urosepsis.  Patient presents with positive UA, fever, elevated WBC,
   and radiographic evidence of pylonephritis.   Patient was hypotensive
   requiring levophed and dobutamine, but has been weaned off dobuta and
   has titrated down levophed. Normal random cortisol level
   - Levophed to maintain MAPS >65; dobutamine if necessary
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - cefepime/vanco for broad coverage (will need to be adjusted for renal
   fucntion)
   - monitor urine output
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema.  Patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to
   significant fluid boluses.  Serial blood gas shows combined metabaolic
   acidosis and respiratory alkalsosis with adequate oxygenation.
   - continue mechanical ventillation with effort to normalize pH
   - serial CXR
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   3.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheuamtic fever.
   - hold lasix, aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   .
   4.  Rhythmn.  Patient having significant ectopy on telemetry,
   particularly while on dobutamine.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   5. Elevated INR.  Patient has a history of mitral valve replacement and
   A. fib so is anticoatulated with coumadin.  INR continues to rise
   suspect secondary to medications, but will evaluate for DIC.  Patient
   given 2.5 mg PO of vit K today.  Patient has history of HIT so if she
   has subtherapuetic inr in the future, will be unable to bridge with
   heparin.  Her mechanical valve and a. fib are strong indications for
   anticoagulation.
   - hold coumadin
   - give 2.5 mg po vitamin k and follow serial INR
   - follow PT, PTT, INR
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   .
   6.  Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis.  Patient noted to have a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis on lab.  Patient initially presented
   with diarrhea, however, acidosis developed in setting of aggressive IVF
   so likely due to this.  Will switch to LR for fluids now.
   - follow gap
   - LR instead of NS
   .
   7.  ARF.  Patient noted to have Cr of 3.0 on admission with baseline Cr
   of 1.0.  Creatinine is already improving with IVF suggesting an
   pre-renal component.  No signs of hydronephrosis on catcan.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - follow Cr
   - pressors to maintain MAPS > 65
   - hold lasix, lisinopril, aldactone
   - renally dose all antibiotics
   .
   8.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly)
   .
   9. Depression.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 61-year-old female with dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), post Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) for rheumatic heart disease, history of subdural hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with urosepsis.

2. The patient's INR was supratherapeutic with a peak of 21.1, and vitamin K was given. INR is trending downwards since then, down to 4.1 this morning. Fibrinogen is low at 141, and the picture may be consistent with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). LFTs continue to rise with normal bilirubin.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be [**2-26**]
   urosepsis. Also with possible DIC picture with peak INR 21.1 which is
   now trending downwards. This AM with acute change in mental status and
   unreponsiveness.
   .
   #. Acute change in mental status: Patient was able to interact with
   staff and family last night, this AM without withdrawal to painful
   stimulus except slight withdrawal to nailbed pressure to left toe.
   Positive corneal reflex. Equivocal toes. Concerning as patient with h/o
   VP shunt and also in context of high INR yesterday, would want to r/o
   bleed in head
   - Stat CT of head to r/o bleed
   - continue to hold sedation and follow neuron exam. Patient
s LFTs
   increased so her AMS may be a result of decreased clearance of sedating
   meds
   - if no bleed and no regaining of mental status, can consider further
   w/u such as toxic/metabolic workup
   .
   #. Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx growing out GNR but not in high titers.
   However, we are evaluating for other sources, such as abdominal (with
   diarrhea and history of cdiff in past).   Patient was hypotensive
   requiring levophed and dobutamine, but has been weaned off dobuta and
   has titrated down levophed. Overnight started on vasopressin in effort
   to titrate down levophed. Also given fluid boluses with LR. Abx
   broadened to vanc/cefepime/flagyl. Cultures pending
   - continue vasopressin and levophed. Continue to titrate levophed as
   tolerated
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - cefepime/vanco/flagyl for broad coverage. f/u speciation and
   sensitivities of GNR in urine to narrow. Called micro lab to add on
   speciation and sensitivities
   - monitor urine output
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema.  Patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to
   significant fluid boluses.  Serial blood gas shows combined metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation.
   - continue mechanical ventillation with effort to normalize pH
   - serial CXR
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   #. Elevated INR.  Patient
s INR peaked yesterday at 21.1, then was
   given vitamin K 10mg PO and has been trending downwards to 4.1 since.
   Patient has a history of mitral valve replacement and A. fib so
   important to maintain anticoagulation. anticoagulated with coumadin at
   home, and with h/o HIT so this complicates patient
s anticoagulation.
   Most likely etiology is DIC picture with rising LFTs and decreased
   fibrinogen. Normal bili and patient with no h/o liver disease.
   - follow serial coags and Hct Q6 hrs
   - f/u stat head CT to r/o bleed
 if no bleed and coags continue to
   trend downwards, patient may need anticoagulation bridging with
   argatroban given history of HIT
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   #.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold lasix, aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   .
   #.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - Continue to titrate down levophed as tolerated which may help
   decrease ectopy
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   #.  ARF.  Patient noted to have Cr of 3.0 on admission with baseline Cr
   of 1.0.  Creatinine is already improving with IVF suggesting an
   pre-renal component.  No signs of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - follow Cr
   - pressors to maintain MAPS > 65
   - hold lasix, lisinopril, aldactone
   - renally dose all antibiotics
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly)
   .
   #. Depression.
   - Zoloft

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), s/p mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, history of subdural hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with urosepsis. The patient's current condition includes acute change in mental status, septic shock, respiratory failure, elevated INR, dilated cardiomyopathy, rhythm disturbances, acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, and depression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bleeding: The patient's high INR and history of VP shunt increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the brain. A stat CT scan of the head is ordered to rule out any bleed.
2. Septic shock: The patient is still hypotensive despite weaning off dobutamine and titrating down levophed. Vasopressin and levophed continue to be administered, and fluid boluses are given to maintain MAPS > 65.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to significant fluid boluses. Serial blood gases and CXR will be monitored to normalize pH and assess lung condition.
4. DIC picture: The patient's elevated LFTs and decreased fibrinogen suggest a possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) picture. Serial coagulation studies and Hct will be followed, and if"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be [**2-26**]
   urosepsis. Also with possible DIC picture with peak INR 21.1 which is
   now trending downwards. This AM with acute change in mental status and
   unreponsiveness.
   .
   #. Acute change in mental status: Patient was able to interact with
   staff and family last night, this AM without withdrawal to painful
   stimulus except slight withdrawal to nailbed pressure to left toe.
   Positive corneal reflex. Equivocal toes. Concerning as patient with h/o
   VP shunt and also in context of high INR yesterday, would want to r/o
   bleed in head
   - Stat CT of head to r/o bleed
   - continue to hold sedation and follow neuron exam. Patient
s LFTs
   increased so her AMS may be a result of decreased clearance of sedating
   meds
   - if no bleed and no regaining of mental status, can consider further
   w/u such as toxic/metabolic workup
   .
   #. Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx growing out GNR but not in high titers.
   However, we are evaluating for other sources, such as abdominal (with
   diarrhea and history of cdiff in past).   Patient was hypotensive
   requiring levophed and dobutamine, but has been weaned off dobuta and
   has titrated down levophed. Overnight started on vasopressin in effort
   to titrate down levophed. Also given fluid boluses with LR. Abx
   broadened to vanc/cefepime/flagyl. Cultures pending
   - continue vasopressin and levophed. Continue to titrate levophed as
   tolerated
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - cefepime/vanco/flagyl for broad coverage. f/u speciation and
   sensitivities of GNR in urine to narrow. Called micro lab to add on
   speciation and sensitivities
   - monitor urine output
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema.  Patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to
   significant fluid boluses.  Serial blood gas shows combined metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation.
   - continue mechanical ventillation with effort to normalize pH
   - serial CXR
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   #. Elevated INR.  Patient
s INR peaked yesterday at 21.1, then was
   given vitamin K 10mg PO and has been trending downwards to 4.1 since.
   Patient has a history of mitral valve replacement and A. fib so
   important to maintain anticoagulation. anticoagulated with coumadin at
   home, and with h/o HIT so this complicates patient
s anticoagulation.
   Most likely etiology is DIC picture with rising LFTs and decreased
   fibrinogen. Normal bili and patient with no h/o liver disease.
   - follow serial coags and Hct Q6 hrs
   - f/u stat head CT to r/o bleed
 if no bleed and coags continue to
   trend downwards, patient may need anticoagulation bridging with
   argatroban given history of HIT
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   #.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold lasix, aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   .
   #.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - Continue to titrate down levophed as tolerated which may help
   decrease ectopy
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   #.  ARF.  Patient noted to have Cr of 3.0 on admission with baseline Cr
   of 1.0.  Creatinine is already improving with IVF suggesting an
   pre-renal component.  No signs of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - follow Cr
   - pressors to maintain MAPS > 65
   - hold lasix, lisinopril, aldactone
   - renally dose all antibiotics
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 5130], a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), post-mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt, was admitted with urosepsis. The patient's current condition includes lethargy, unresponsiveness, supratherapeutic INR, low fibrinogen, elevated LFTs, possible DIC picture, acute change in mental status, septic shock, respiratory failure, and elevated creatinine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's high INR and history of VP shunt increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the brain. A stat CT of the head is recommended to rule out a bleed.
2. Septic Shock: The patient presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis, indicating possible urosepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and fluid boluses with LR have been given. Monitoring urine and blood cultures is important.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for tachypnea and increased work of breathing. Serial blood gas analysis shows combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation. Mechanical ventilation should continue, and efforts should be made to normalize pH.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR peaked at 21.1"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**], a 61-year-old female patient with dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), post mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, history of subdural hematoma and VP shunt, was admitted with urosepsis. The patient's INR was supratherapeutic with a peak at 21.1, which is now trending downwards. Fibrinogen levels are low at 141 (hypo, FSP wnl), indicating a possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) picture. Liver function tests (LFTs) continue to rise with normal bilirubin levels.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 109/65 mmHg to 80/44 mmHg, heart rate of 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low platelet count, and abnormal renal function tests (creatinine 3.0 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 32 mg/dL). Other lab results include abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR), elevated lactate levels, low albumin, and elevated lactic acid levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septic shock: The patient presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis, indicating possible urosepsis. UCx growing out Gram-negative rods (GNR). Broadened antibiotic coverage to vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. Cultures pending.
- Continue vasopressin and levophed. Titrate levophed as tolerated.
- IVF bolus to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65.
- Follow up urine and blood cultures.
- Cefepime/vanco/flagyl for broad coverage. Follow speciation and sensitivities of GNR in urine to narrow.
- Monitor urine output.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for tachypnea and increased work of breathing. CXR shows increased interstitial edema. The patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to significant fluid boluses. Serial blood gas shows combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation.
- Continue mechanical ventilation with effort to normalize pH.
- Serial chest X-ray.
- Fentanyl/versed for sedation.

3. Elevated INR: The patient has a history of mitral valve replacement"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female who presented with diarrhea, found to be hypotensive in
   PCP's office and with signs of sepsis on arrival to ED.  Now
   hemodynamics are improving but neurologic exam significantly
   deteriorated over course of the last hour.
    1. Shock:  Likely sepsis given fevers and history.  This may be
   urosepsis given evidence of pyelo on CT although her urine cx was
   underwhelming and blood cx negative.  Had diarrhea on admission so
   checking C.diff.
   - cont vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - called lab to identify GNR in urine
   - cont vasopressin, wean levophed as tolerated, will be better ableto
   assess need for further volume resusictaion when CVL is in place
   2. Waxing [**Doctor Last Name 42**] mental status:  Yesterday was awake and following
   commands. Initial concern for head bleed given very high INR but stat
   head ct negative. Wean sedation
   3. Elevated INR:  Improved after vitamin K.  Likely was due to DIC in
   setting of sepsis.  INR now trending down.  If head CT is negative for
   bleed, may need to bridge her with argatroban.
   - repeat INR later today
   4. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for respiratory distress/tachypnea
   in ED.  Doing well on ventilator currently.  CXR suggestive of volume
   overload but hold diuresis while still on pressors.
   5. ARF:  Likely prerenal due to hypotension, now improved.  Robust UOP.
   6. Coronary Artery Disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy:
   - Continue ASA/Statin
   - Holding beta-blocker, dig in setting of shock.
   7. Mechanical MVR- Holding anticoagulation given elevated INR.  As
   above, will need argatroban if INR continues to drop.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy, admitted with septic shock likely due to urosepsis. She has been febrile, received boluses of lactated Ringer's solution, and has been treated with vasopressors and antibiotics. The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and she is intubated for respiratory distress. Her INR is elevated but has improved after vitamin K administration. She has acute renal failure, possibly prerenal, and coronary artery disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy. She also has a mechanical mitral valve replacement. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is still in shock, which needs to be continuously monitored and managed. There is a risk of further deterioration in organ perfusion and function.
2. Neurologic Deterioration: The patient's mental status has significantly worsened, indicating a potential neurological complication. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjustment of ventilator settings may be required to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a risk of bleeding. Monitoring and appropriate anticoagulation management are crucial to prevent hemorrhagic complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female who presented with diarrhea, found to be hypotensive in
   PCP's office and with signs of sepsis on arrival to ED.  Now
   hemodynamics are improving but neurologic exam significantly
   deteriorated over course of the last hour.
   1. Unresponsiveness:  Yesterday was awake and following commands.
   Currently sedation has been off for approx 1 hour and is not
   withdrawing to pain in any extremities (although reportedly was
   withdrawing legs 15 minutes ago.)  Has corneal reflexes but no gag.
   Given her recently elevated INR this is highly concerning for
   intracranial hemorrhage.
   - stat head CT
   - hold sedation
   2. Shock:  Likely sepsis given fevers and history.  This may be
   urosepsis given evidence of pyelo on CT although her urine cx was
   underwhelming and blood cx negative.  Had diarrhea on admission so
   checking C.diff.
   - cont vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - called lab to identify GNR in urine
   - cont vasopressin, wean levophed as tolerated
   3. Elevated INR:  Improved after vitamin K.  Likely was due to DIC in
   setting of sepsis.  INR now trending down.  If head CT is negative for
   bleed, may need to bridge her with argatroban.
   - repeat INR later today
   4. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for respiratory distress/tachypnea
   in ED.  Doing well on ventilator currently.  CXR suggestive of volume
   overload but hold diuresis while still on pressors.
   5. ARF:  Likely prerenal due to hypotension, now improved.  Robust UOP.
   6. Coronary Artery Disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy:
   - Continue ASA/Statin
   - Holding beta-blocker, dig in setting of shock.
   7. Mechanical MVR- Holding anticoagulation given elevated INR.  As
   above, will need argatroban if INR continues to drop.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy, admitted with septic shock, likely due to urosepsis. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with a significant worsening of the neurologic exam over the last hour. There are concerns for intracranial hemorrhage, and a stat head CT is recommended. The patient is currently unresponsive and not withdrawing to pain, although corneal reflexes are present.

The patient's shock is likely septic, possibly urosepsis, given fevers and history. Antibiotics have been continued, and vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions are ongoing. The patient's elevated INR has improved after vitamin K administration and is now trending down. If the head CT is negative for bleed, the patient may need to be bridged with argatroban.

The patient's respiratory failure required intubation and is currently doing well on the ventilator. The CXR suggests volume overload, but diuresis has been held while on pressors. Acute renal failure is likely prerenal due to hypotension, but is now improved. Coronary artery disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy is ongoing, and the patient's mechanical MVR (mitral valve replacement) requires anticoagulation to be held due to the elevated INR.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be [**2-26**]
   urosepsis, with continued fevers on Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx grew 6,000 organisms, awaiting C&S.  Given
   ongoing fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and unremarkable
   urine culture, will evaluate for other sources of fever such as C.
   diff.  Will get renal ultrasound to evaluate for abscess and send stool
   cultures (though not having diarrhea and is on Flagyl.  Levophed has
   been weaned after 3 days, but patient still on vasopressin.  Patient
   has VP shunt, so also at risk for shunt infection.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - attempt to d/c vasopressin
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u stool culture
   - follow UOP
   - obtain records of prior UTIs from PCP to determine sensitivities of
   prior UTIs
   - consider VP shunt tap in future if patient continues to have fevers
   in spite of broad spectrum abx
    .
   2.  Mental status.  Concern yesterday for unresponsiveness after
   weaning sedation in female with h/o subdural with VP shunt in place for
   h/o hydrocephalus.  Given that patient had INR > 20,stat head ct was
   obtained, but was unchanged from prior.   Later in the day, mental
   status improved with lightening of sedation.
   - minimize sedating meds
   - monitor mental status
   - consider neurosurg consult for VPshunt tap in the future if mental
   status and fevers do not improve
   .
   3.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema with pleural effusions biltaerally.  Patient is at risk for
   developing pulmonary edema due to significant fluid boluses.  Serial
   blood gas shows combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis
   with adequate oxygenation.
   - tiral of pressure support
   - serial CXR
   - minimize fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   4. Elevated INR.  INR rose to >20 yesterday, with mild DIC and recent
   coumadin use.  After 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so
   argatroban was started.  PTT is therapeutic on argatroban now.
   - follow serial coags and [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold lasix, aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.
   - free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   8.  Transaminitis.  LFTs mildly elevated, likely secondary to shock
   liver.   Normal T. bili and Alk Phos.
   - follow LFTs
   .
   8.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF now resolved after aggressive fluids.  No signs
   of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - follow Cr
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly)

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with dilated cardiomyopathy, who underwent mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease. She has a history of subdural hematoma and VP shunt placement. The patient was admitted with septic shock suspected to be urosepsis. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, she continues to have fevers. She also has a VP shunt, which increases the risk of shunt infection. The patient is still on vasopressin and has a history of subdural hematoma and VP shunt.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis, indicating possible urosepsis. Ongoing fevers in spite of broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest the need to evaluate other sources of fever.

2. Mental status changes: The patient had a concern for unresponsiveness after weaning sedation. Given her history of subdural hematoma and VP shunt, it is important to monitor her mental status and consider a neurosurgical consult for VP shunt tap in the future if her mental status and fevers do not improve.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for tachypnea and increased work of breathing. Serial blood gases show combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation. The patient is at risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be [**2-26**]
   urosepsis, with continued fevers on Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx grew 6,000 organisms, awaiting C&S.  Given
   ongoing fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and unremarkable
   urine culture, will evaluate for other sources of fever such as C.
   diff.  Will get renal ultrasound to evaluate for abscess and send stool
   cultures (though not having diarrhea and is on Flagyl.  Levophed has
   been weaned after 3 days, but patient still on vasopressin.  Patient
   has VP shunt, so also at risk for shunt infection.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - attempt to d/c vasopressin
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u stool culture
   - follow UOP
    .
   2.  Mental status.  Concern yesterday for unresponsiveness after
   weaning sedation in female with h/o subdural with VP shunt in place for
   h/o hydrocephalus  Acute change in mental status: Patient was able to
   interact with staff and family last night, this AM without withdrawal
   to painful stimulus except slight withdrawal to nailbed pressure to
   left toe. Positive corneal reflex. Equivocal toes. Concerning as
   patient with h/o VP shunt and also in context of high INR yesterday,
   would want to r/o bleed in head
   - Stat CT of head to r/o bleed
   - continue to hold sedation and follow neuron exam. Patient
s LFTs
   increased so her AMS may be a result of decreased clearance of sedating
   meds
   - if no bleed and no regaining of mental status, can consider further
   w/u such as toxic/metabolic workup
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema.  Patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to
   significant fluid boluses.  Serial blood gas shows combined metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation.
   - continue mechanical ventillation with effort to normalize pH
   - serial CXR
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   #. Elevated INR.  Patient
s INR peaked yesterday at 21.1, then was
   given vitamin K 10mg PO and has been trending downwards to 4.1 since.
   Patient has a history of mitral valve replacement and A. fib so
   important to maintain anticoagulation. anticoagulated with coumadin at
   home, and with h/o HIT so this complicates patient
s anticoagulation.
   Most likely etiology is DIC picture with rising LFTs and decreased
   fibrinogen. Normal bili and patient with no h/o liver disease.
   - follow serial coags and Hct Q6 hrs
   - f/u stat head CT to r/o bleed
 if no bleed and coags continue to
   trend downwards, patient may need anticoagulation bridging with
   argatroban given history of HIT
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   #.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold lasix, aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   .
   #.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - Continue to titrate down levophed as tolerated which may help
   decrease ectopy
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   #.  ARF.  Patient noted to have Cr of 3.0 on admission with baseline Cr
   of 1.0.  Creatinine is already improving with IVF suggesting an
   pre-renal component.  No signs of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - follow Cr
   - pressors to maintain MAPS > 65
   - hold lasix, lisinopril, aldactone
   - renally dose all antibiotics
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral valve replacement, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock suspected to be urosepsis. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers, suggesting a possible infection. The urine culture is awaiting results, and further investigation is needed to identify other potential sources of fever, such as Clostridium difficile or an abscess. The patient's VP shunt puts her at risk for shunt infection as well. 

The patient's mental status has been a concern, with unresponsiveness after weaning sedation. Although she was able to interact with staff and family last night and this morning, she showed slight withdrawal to painful stimulus and equivocal toes. A stat head CT is recommended to rule out a bleed, considering the high INR yesterday and the patient's history of VP shunt. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she remains on mechanical ventilation. Her blood gases show combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation. Serial CXR and blood gases will be monitored to assess her progress. 

The patient's elevated INR peaked at 21.1 and was treated with vitamin K. She has a history of mitral valve replacement and atrial fibrillation, requiring anticoagulation. The most likely etiology of the elevated INR is disseminated intrav"

   stimulus except slight withdrawal to nailbed pressure to left toe.
   Positive corneal reflex. Equivocal toes. Concerning as patient with h/o
   VP shunt and also in context of high INR yesterday, would want to r/o
   bleed in head
   - Stat CT of head to r/o bleed
   - continue to hold sedation and follow neuron exam. Patient
s LFTs
   increased so her AMS may be a result of decreased clearance of sedating
   meds
   - if no bleed and no regaining of mental status, can consider further
   w/u such as toxic/metabolic workup
   .
   #. Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx growing out GNR but not in high titers.
   However, we are evaluating for other sources, such as abdominal (with
   diarrhea and history of cdiff in past).   Patient was hypotensive
   requiring levophed and dobutamine, but has been weaned off dobuta and
   has titrated down levophed. Overnight started on vasopressin in effort
   to titrate down levophed. Also given fluid boluses with LR. Abx
   broadened to vanc/cefepime/flagyl. Cultures pending
   - continue vasopressin and levophed. Continue to titrate levophed as
   tolerated
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - cefepime/vanco/flagyl for broad coverage. f/u speciation and
   sensitivities of GNR in urine to narrow. Called micro lab to add on
   speciation and sensitivities
   - monitor urine output

   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema.  Patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema due to
   significant fluid boluses.  Serial blood gas shows combined metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation.
   - continue mechanical ventillation with effort to normalize pH
   - serial CXR
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation

   #. Elevated INR.  Patient
s INR peaked yesterday at 21.1, then was
   given vitamin K 10mg PO and has been trending downwards to 4.1 since.
   Patient has a history of mitral valve replacement and A. fib so
   important to maintain anticoagulation. anticoagulated with coumadin at
   home, and with h/o HIT so this complicates patient
s anticoagulation.
   Most likely etiology is DIC picture with rising LFTs and decreased
   fibrinogen. Normal bili and patient with no h/o liver disease.
   - follow serial coags and Hct Q6 hrs
   - f/u stat head CT to r/o bleed
 if no bleed and coags continue to
   trend downwards, patient may need anticoagulation bridging with
   argatroban given history of HIT
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   #.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be [**2-26**]
   urosepsis, with continued fevers on Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx grew 6,000 organisms, awaiting C&S.  Given
   ongoing fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and unremarkable
   urine culture, will evaluate for other sources of fever such as C.
   diff.  Will get renal ultrasound to evaluate for abscess and send stool
   cultures (though not having diarrhea and is on Flagyl.  Levophed has
   been weaned after 3 days, but patient still on vasopressin.  Patient
   has VP shunt, so also at risk for shunt infection.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - attempt to d/c vasopressin

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral valve replacement, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock suspected to be due to urosepsis. The patient continues to have ongoing fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and an unremarkable urine culture. Other potential sources of fever are being evaluated, such as Clostridium difficile infection and abscess in the kidneys. The patient's mental status has improved, but there is still concern for a possible bleed in the head given her history of VP shunt and high INR. The patient's respiratory failure is due to increased interstitial edema on CXR and risk of developing pulmonary edema. Her elevated INR is likely due to DIC with rising LFTs and decreased fibrinogen. Anticoagulation management is complicated by the patient's history of HIT. The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%, and her rhythm is still erratic. She also has acute renal failure with an initial creatinine level of 3.0 and baseline creatinine of 1.0, which is improving with IV fluids. The patient's other medical conditions include hypothyroidism, depression, and peptic ulcer disease."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented to the ICU with urosepsis and diarrhea. They have undergone several interventions including a stat head CT, administration of vit K, placement of a groin line and internal jugular (IJ) line, and initiation of antibiotic therapy. Despite these measures, the patient continues to experience ongoing fevers.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which can be exacerbated by sepsis or the use of certain medications.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, but they may still experience fluctuations due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
3. Renal impairment: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible renal dysfunction.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, indicating a risk of bleeding. The use of argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, suggests a concern for coagulation abnormalities.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged duration of intubation.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has diarrhea, which may be related to the sepsis or other underlying conditions.
7. Infectious complications: Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient continues"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female who presented with diarrhea, found to be hypotensive in
   PCP's office and with signs of sepsis on arrival to ED.  Now
   hemodynamics are improving but is persistently febrile.
    1. Shock:  Likely sepsis given fevers and history.  This may be
   urosepsis given evidence of pyelo on CT although her urine cx was
   underwhelming and blood cx negative.  Had diarrhea on admission so
   checking C.diff.  Concerning that she continues to have fevers despite
   underwhelming culture data.
   - cont vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - called lab to identify GNR in urine
   - levophed off, attempt to d/c vasopressin later
   - renal u/s to assess for perinephric fluid collection
   2. Elevated INR:  Was likely due to DIC but then became subtherapeutic
   after vitamin K.
   - cont argatroban (has hx HIT and also hx of clotting valve)
   3. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for respiratory distress/tachypnea
   in ED.  Doing well on ventilator currently.
   - attempt PSV today
   - wean sedation
   4. ARF:  Likely prerenal due to hypotension, now improved.  Robust UOP.
   5. Coronary Artery Disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy:
   - Continue ASA/Statin
   - Holding beta-blocker, dig in setting of shock.
   6. Mechanical MVR- Argatroban.  Restart coumadin once stabilized.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with diarrhea and was found to be hypotensive in the PCP's office. She showed signs of sepsis upon arrival to the ED and is now improving but still febrile. The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics, vasopressin, and anticoagulants. She has been intubated for respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition indicates several potential medical complications:

1. Shock: The patient likely has septic shock given her fevers, history, and the presence of diarrhea. This may be urosepsis due to evidence of pyelo on CT, although her urine culture was underwhelming and blood culture negative. It is concerning that she continues to have fevers despite underwhelming culture data.

2. Elevated INR: The patient's INR became elevated but then became subtherapeutic after vitamin K administration. This could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other factors.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and tachypnea in the ED. She is currently doing well on the ventilator.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient likely has ARF, possibly prerenal due to hypotension, which has now improved. She has a robust urinary output.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female who presented with diarrhea, found to be hypotensive in
   PCP's office and with signs of sepsis on arrival to ED.  Now
   hemodynamics are improving but is persistently febrile.
    1. Shock:  Likely sepsis given fevers and history.  This may be
   urosepsis given evidence of pyelo on CT although her urine cx was
   underwhelming and blood cx negative.  Had diarrhea on admission so
   checking C.diff.  Concerning that she continues to have fevers despite
   underwhelming culture data.
   - cont vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - called lab to identify GNR in urine
   - levophed off, attempt to d/c vasopressin later
   - renal u/s to assess for perinephric fluid collection
   2. Elevated INR:  Was likely due to DIC but then became subtherapeutic
   after vitamin K.
   - cont argatroban (has hx HIT and also hx of clotting valve)
   3. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for respiratory distress/tachypnea
   in ED.  Doing well on ventilator currently.
   - attempt PSV today
   - wean sedation
   4. ARF:  Likely prerenal due to hypotension, now improved.  Robust UOP.
   5. Coronary Artery Disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy:
   - Continue ASA/Statin
   - Holding beta-blocker, dig in setting of shock.
   6. Mechanical MVR- Argatroban.  Restart coumadin once stabilized.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with diarrhea, hypotension, and signs of sepsis. She is currently in the ICU and has been improving, but still has persistent fevers. The patient's condition includes shock, likely due to sepsis, possibly urosepsis given evidence of pyelo on CT. There is concern about ongoing infection despite underwhelming culture data.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve, and a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). 

The patient is currently on several medications, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, midazolam (Versed), vasopressin, fentanyl, and argatroban. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows worsened opacity at the right base, likely effusion, and continued cardiomegaly. 

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics, identifying the GNR in urine, attempting to discontinue vasopressin, performing a renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be [**2-26**]
   urosepsis, with continued fevers on Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx grew 6,000 organisms, awaiting C&S.  Given
   ongoing fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and unremarkable
   urine culture, will evaluate for other sources of fever such as C.
   diff.  Will get renal ultrasound to evaluate for abscess and send stool
   cultures (though not having diarrhea and is on Flagyl.  Levophed has
   been weaned after 3 days, but patient still on vasopressin.  Patient
   has VP shunt, so also at risk for shunt infection.

   2.  Mental status.  Concern yesterday for unresponsiveness after
   weaning sedation in female with h/o subdural with VP shunt in place for
   h/o hydrocephalus.  Given that patient had INR > 20,stat head ct was
   obtained, but was unchanged from prior.   Later in the day, mental
   status improved with lightening of sedation.
   - minimize sedating meds
   - monitor mental status
   - consider neurosurg consult for VPshunt tap in the future if mental
   status and fevers do not improve
   .
   3.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema with pleural effusions biltaerally.  Patient is at risk for
   developing pulmonary edema due to significant fluid boluses.  Serial
   blood gas shows combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis
   with adequate oxygenation.
   - tiral of pressure support
   - serial CXR
   - minimize fentanyl/versed for sedation

   4. Elevated INR.  INR rose to >20 yesterday, with mild DIC and recent
   coumadin use.  After 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so
   argatroban was started.  PTT is therapeutic on argatroban now.

","Summary:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), post mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, and a history of subdural hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be urosepsis. She presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, she continues to have fevers, and her urine culture is negative for Clostridium difficile. She has a VP shunt in place, putting her at risk for shunt infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient presented with signs of septic shock, including positive urine analysis, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, she continues to have fevers, indicating a potential ongoing infection. 
2. Urosepsis: The patient's presentation suggests urosepsis, which is a severe infection that spreads throughout the body from the urinary tract. It is important to evaluate other sources of fever and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. VP shunt infection: Given the patient's VP shunt in place, there is a risk of shunt infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and considering future VP shunt tap if the patient continues to have fevers in spite of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Mental status"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be [**2-26**]
   urosepsis, with continued fevers on Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx grew 6,000 organisms, awaiting C&S.  Given
   ongoing fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and unremarkable
   urine culture, will evaluate for other sources of fever such as C.
   diff.  Will get renal ultrasound to evaluate for abscess and send stool
   cultures (though not having diarrhea and is on Flagyl.  Levophed has
   been weaned after 3 days, but patient still on vasopressin.  Patient
   has VP shunt, so also at risk for shunt infection.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - attempt to d/c vasopressin
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u stool culture
   - follow UOP
   - obtain records of prior UTIs from PCP to determine sensitivities of
   prior UTIs
   - consider VP shunt tap in future if patient continues to have fevers
   in spite of broad spectrum abx
    .
   2.  Mental status.  Concern yesterday for unresponsiveness after
   weaning sedation in female with h/o subdural with VP shunt in place for
   h/o hydrocephalus.  Given that patient had INR > 20,stat head ct was
   obtained, but was unchanged from prior.   Later in the day, mental
   status improved with lightening of sedation.
   - minimize sedating meds
   - monitor mental status
   - consider neurosurg consult for VPshunt tap in the future if mental
   status and fevers do not improve
   .
   3.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema with pleural effusions biltaerally.  Patient is at risk for
   developing pulmonary edema due to significant fluid boluses.  Serial
   blood gas shows combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis
   with adequate oxygenation.
   - tiral of pressure support
   - serial CXR
   - minimize fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   4. Elevated INR.  INR rose to >20 yesterday, with mild DIC and recent
   coumadin use.  After 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so
   argatroban was started.  PTT is therapeutic on argatroban now.
   - follow serial coags and [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold lasix, aldactone, coreg given hypotension

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), post mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be urosepsis. The patient has ongoing fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is suspicion of other sources of fever such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient also has a VP shunt in place, putting her at risk for shunt infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's current condition is septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure. This can result in organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Urosepsis: The patient's symptoms suggest urosepsis, a severe infection that has spread from the urinary tract to the bloodstream. This can lead to septic shock and organ dysfunction.

3. C. diff infection: The patient's ongoing fevers and the presence of a VP shunt increase the risk of developing a C. diff infection. This bacterial infection can cause severe diarrhea and can be difficult to treat.

4. Shunt infection: With the VP shunt in place, there is a risk of shunt infection, which can lead to serious complications such as meningitis or brain abs"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock thought to be [**2-26**]
   urosepsis, with continued fevers on Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which indicates
   possible urosepsis. UCx grew 6,000 organisms, awaiting C&S.  Given
   ongoing fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and unremarkable
   urine culture, will evaluate for other sources of fever such as C.
   diff.  Will get renal ultrasound to evaluate for abscess and send stool
   cultures (though not having diarrhea and is on Flagyl.  Levophed has
   been weaned after 3 days, but patient still on vasopressin.  Patient
   has VP shunt, so also at risk for shunt infection.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - attempt to d/c vasopressin
   - IVF bolus to keep maps > 65
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u stool culture
   - follow UOP
   - obtain records of prior UTIs from PCP to determine sensitivities of
   prior UTIs
   - consider VP shunt tap in future if patient continues to have fevers
   in spite of broad spectrum abx
    .
   2.  Mental status.  Concern yesterday for unresponsiveness after
   weaning sedation in female with h/o subdural with VP shunt in place for
   h/o hydrocephalus.  Given that patient had INR > 20,stat head ct was
   obtained, but was unchanged from prior.   Later in the day, mental
   status improved with lightening of sedation.
   - minimize sedating meds
   - monitor mental status
   - consider neurosurg consult for VPshunt tap in the future if mental
   status and fevers do not improve
   .
   3.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR today shows increased interstitial
   edema with pleural effusions biltaerally.  Patient is at risk for
   developing pulmonary edema due to significant fluid boluses.  Serial
   blood gas shows combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis
   with adequate oxygenation.
   - tiral of pressure support
   - serial CXR
   - minimize fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   4. Elevated INR.  INR rose to >20 yesterday, with mild DIC and recent
   coumadin use.  After 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so
   argatroban was started.  PTT is therapeutic on argatroban now.
   - follow serial coags and [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold lasix, aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.
   - free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   8.  Transaminitis.  LFTs mildly elevated, likely secondary to shock
   liver.   Normal T. bili and Alk Phos.
   - follow LFTs
   .
   8.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF now resolved after aggressive fluids.  No signs
   of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - follow Cr
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly)
   .
   10. Depression.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock and persistently
   febrile in spite of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis.  Being covered for
   bowel pathogens and c. diff with flagyl.  All other cultures have been
   negative.  Hemodynamically patient is significantly improved (now off
   pressors), but has persistent daily fevers.  Renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess.
   -speak with neurosurg re: tapping her VP shunt as potential source of
   infection
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   - follow UOP, bolus for low UOP
   - obtain records of prior UTIs from PCP to determine sensitivities of
   prior UTIs
   .
   2.  Mental status.  Concern in past for unresponsiveness after weaning
   sedation in female with h/o subdural with VP shunt in place for h/o
   hydrocephalus.  Given that patient had INR > 20,stat head ct was
   obtained, but was unchanged from prior.   Mental status now seems
   appropriate though sedated from versed/fentanyl.
   - monitor mental status
   - consider neurosurg consult for VPshunt tap in the future if mental
   status and fevers do not improve
   .
   3.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR stable.  Patient tolerated PS trial
   for 12 hours but became tachypneic, tachycardia, with increased work of
   breathing at the end.
   - initiate trial of diuresis
   - serial CXR
   .
   4. Elevated INR.  INR rose to >20 on admission, with mild DIC and
   recent coumadin use.  After 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so
   argatroban was started.  PTT is therapeutic on argatroban now.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   - resume lasix to begin diuresis
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Improved with free water boluses and D5W.  KVOs
   switched to D5W.
   - free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   8.  Transaminitis.  LFTs mildly elevated, likely secondary to shock
   liver.   Normal T. bili and Alk Phos.
   - follow LFTs
   .
   8.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF now resolved after aggressive fluids.  No signs
   of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - follow Cr
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly)
   .
   10. Depression.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with positive UA, fever, elevated WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. Although the UCx grew only 6000 E. coli, the patient's persistent daily fevers and initial presentation raise concerns for alternative explanations of sepsis.

2. Mental status: The patient had a concern in the past for unresponsiveness after weaning sedation in a female with a history of subdural hematoma and VP shunt in place for hydrocephalus. Although the mental status seems appropriate at the moment, monitoring the patient's mental status and considering a neurosurg consult for VP shunt tap in the future if mental status and fevers do not improve is recommended.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for tachypnea and increased work of breathing. CXR stable. The patient tolerated a pressure support trial for 12 hours but became tachypneic, tachycardic, with increased work of breathing at the end. Initiating a trial of diuresis and serial CXR is advised.

4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR rose to >20 on admission, with mild DIC and recent coumadin use. After receiving 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so argatroban was started"

   Sputum cx pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female who presented with diarrhea, found to be hypotensive in
   PCP's office and with signs of sepsis on arrival to ED.  Now
   hemodynamics are improving but is persistently febrile.
    1. Shock:  Likely sepsis given fevers and history.  This may be
   urosepsis given evidence of pyelo on CT although her urine cx was
   underwhelming and blood cx negative.  Had diarrhea on admission so
   checking C.diff.  Concerning that she continues to have fevers despite
   underwhelming culture data.  Renal u/s negative for perinephric fluid
   collection.
   - cont vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - off pressors
   - discuss possibility of shunt tap with Neurosurgery given persistent
   fevers
   2. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for respiratory distress/tachypnea
   in ED.  Doing well on ventilator currently but became tachycardic and
   tachypneic this morning.  Now looks comfortable again back on AC.
   - diuresis today as bp now stable
   - doubt VAP given no new infiltrate, but will f/u on sputum cx.
   Already on broad spectrum abx.
   3. Hypernatremia:  Had not been getting as much free water due to high
   residuals, so has significant free water deficit today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with diarrhea, hypotension, and signs of sepsis. She has been diagnosed with septic shock and is currently in the ICU. The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but she remains persistently febrile. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient is already diagnosed with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by inadequate blood flow to the organs and tissues. It is important to continue aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and close monitoring of vital signs.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and tachypnea in the emergency department. While she is currently stable on the ventilator, there is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The healthcare team should follow up on the sputum culture and continue diuresis as the patient's blood pressure stabilizes.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level due to not receiving enough free water. The healthcare team needs to calculate the free water deficit and replete it appropriately.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has prerenal ARF due to hypotension. With improved hemodynamics, the robust urine output indicates that the kidneys are functioning better.

5. Coronary Artery Disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of CAD/nonis"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female who presented with diarrhea, found to be hypotensive in
   PCP's office and with signs of sepsis on arrival to ED.  Now
   hemodynamics are improving but is persistently febrile.
    1. Shock:  Likely sepsis given fevers and history.  This may be
   urosepsis given evidence of pyelo on CT although her urine cx was
   underwhelming and blood cx negative.  Had diarrhea on admission so
   checking C.diff.  Concerning that she continues to have fevers despite
   underwhelming culture data.  Renal u/s negative for perinephric fluid
   collection.
   - cont vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - off pressors
   - discuss possibility of shunt tap with Neurosurgery given persistent
   fevers
   2. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for respiratory distress/tachypnea
   in ED.  Doing well on ventilator currently but became tachycardic and
   tachypneic this morning.  Now looks comfortable again back on AC.
   - diuresis today as bp now stable
   - doubt VAP given no new infiltrate, but will f/u on sputum cx.
   Already on broad spectrum abx.
   3. Hypernatremia:  Had not been getting as much free water due to high
   residuals, so has significant free water deficit today.
   - calculate free water deficit & replete
   - check sodium q6h
   4. ARF:  Likely prerenal due to hypotension, now improved.  Robust UOP.
   5. Coronary Artery Disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy:
   - Continue ASA/Statin
   - restarted digoxin yesterday
   - likely restart coreg tomorrow if bp stable

She showed signs of sepsis upon arrival to the emergency department and is now persistently febrile. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions and is currently in the ICU.

   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-2**], hemidiaphragms are more

   remain in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock and persistently
   febrile in spite of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.  Hemodynamically
   patient is significantly improved (now off pressors), but has
   persistent daily fevers.  Renal ultrasound negative for abscess.
   Neurosurg feels VP shunt is unlikely.  Also has mechanical mitral
   valve.
   -speak with neurosurg re: tapping her VP shunt as potential source of
   infection
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   - follow UOP, bolus for low UOP
   - obtain records of prior UTIs from PCP to determine sensitivities of
   prior UTIs
   .
   2.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.
   - monitor mental status
   - consider head CT versus MRI if mental status fails to improve off
   sedation
   .
   3.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR shows pleural effusion.  Had RSB of
   47 overnight and tolerated SBT though inability to respond to commands
   remains a [**Known lastname **] to extubation.    Increased tachycardia while off
   sedation is also a [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will resume home coreg.
   - continue lasix IV 80 x 1 to diurese patient given pleural effusion
   - serial CXR
   .
   4. Elevated INR.  INR rose to >20 on admission, with mild DIC and
   recent coumadin use.  After 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so
   argatroban was started.  PTT is therapeutic on argatroban now.   Now
   with guaic positive stools and stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct today given newly guiaic positive stools
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold aldactone given hypotension
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   - resume coreg today
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), post mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. The patient was admitted with septic shock and has been febrile despite being on vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli. There is concern for an alternative explanation of sepsis, although no clear alternative source has been identified. The patient is currently being covered for bowel pathogens and Clostridium difficile with Flagyl. All other cultures have been negative.

2. Mental status changes: The patient has been sedated with fentanyl and Versed, making it difficult to follow commands at present. A head CT obtained 24 hours after admission appeared to be unchanged, although the patient has a large cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and a VP shunt in place. Neurosurgery feels shunt infection is less likely given that it has been in place for several years.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation and an unknown primary diagnosis.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing fever with a maximum temperature of 101.4°F.
- The patient's blood pressure is low, ranging from 65-100/40-52 mmHg, and her heart rate is irregular with atrial fibrillation.
- She has a history of allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime.
- She is receiving continuous infusions of argatroban, fentanyl, and midazolam.
- Her fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,375 mL.
- Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests.
- There is no peripheral vascular examination, skin assessment, or neurologic examination noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, low blood pressure, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's history of thrombocytopenia could contribute to bleeding complications, especially considering her use of anticoagulants.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm may lead"

   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-2**], hemidiaphragms are more

   remain in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock and persistently
   febrile in spite of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis.  Being covered for
   bowel pathogens and c. diff with flagyl.  All other cultures have been
   negative.  Hemodynamically patient is significantly improved (now off
   pressors), but has persistent daily fevers.  Renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess.
   -speak with neurosurg re: tapping her VP shunt as potential source of
   infection
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   - follow UOP, bolus for low UOP
   - obtain records of prior UTIs from PCP to determine sensitivities of
   prior UTIs
   .
   2.  Mental status.  Concern in past for unresponsiveness after weaning
   sedation in female with h/o subdural with VP shunt in place for h/o
   hydrocephalus.  Given that patient had INR > 20,stat head ct was
   obtained, but was unchanged from prior.   Mental status now seems
   appropriate though sedated from versed/fentanyl.
   - monitor mental status
   - consider neurosurg consult for VPshunt tap in the future if mental
   status and fevers do not improve
   .
   Hypernatremia.
   Guiaic positive stools.
   .
   3.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR stable.  Patient tolerated PS trial
   for 12 hours but became tachypneic, tachycardia, with increased work of
   breathing at the end.
   - initiate trial of diuresis
   - serial CXR
   .
   4. Elevated INR.  INR rose to >20 on admission, with mild DIC and
   recent coumadin use.  After 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so
   argatroban was started.  PTT is therapeutic on argatroban now.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold aldactone, coreg given hypotension
   - resume lasix to begin diuresis
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Improved with free water boluses and D5W.  KVOs
   switched to D5W.
   - free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   8.  Transaminitis.  LFTs mildly elevated, likely secondary to shock
   liver.   Normal T. bili and Alk Phos.
   - follow LFTs
   .
   8.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF now resolved after aggressive fluids.  No signs
   of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - follow Cr
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 5130] is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), post mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, subdural hematoma, and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. She was admitted with septic shock and persistent fever despite being on vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl. The patient's urine culture showed 6000 E. coli, leading to concerns about alternative explanations for sepsis. She has been hemodynamically improved but continues to have daily fevers. Renal ultrasound did not reveal any abscess. 

The patient also has mental status concerns, as she was unresponsive after sedation weaning. A head CT was performed but showed no changes. Her mental status appears appropriate at the moment, although she is sedated from Versed/fentanyl. 

Other issues include hypernatremia, guaiac positive stools, respiratory failure, elevated INR, dilated cardiomyopathy, rhythm disturbances, hyperkalemia, transaminitis, acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, and depression. 

The patient is currently on several medications, including lansoprazole, argatroban, fentanyl, midazolam, levothyroxine, sertraline, and chlorhexidine gluconate. She is also receiving IV fluids, insulin sliding scale,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with diarrhea, hypotension, and signs of sepsis upon arrival to the emergency department. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving treatment for sepsis. Her hemodynamics are improving, but she remains febrile. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and tachypnea in the ED. Her RSBI this morning was good, but her mental status is limiting extubation at this time. She has hypernatremia, which has improved today. The plan is to start D5W as she is not receiving boluses due to holding tube feeds for potential extubation. Her acute renal failure has resolved. She has a history of coronary artery disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy and is on ASA/Statin, restarted digoxin, and will continue diuresis today. She also has mechanical mitral valve replacement and is on argatroban. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient may continue to experience septic shock given her fevers and history of sepsis. There is evidence of possible urosepsis with the presence of E. coli in her urine, although her blood culture was negative. Other potential sources of infection should be investigated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if she does not improve or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient had an episode of hypotension and received a NS 500 ml bolus twice, which improved his blood pressure to the 100s. The patient also had a significant stool output and received Lasix 80 mg IV in the morning.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission and is currently on CMV/ASSIST mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygenation is satisfactory with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 334.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.0 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 214 K/uL. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving continuous infusion of argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, due to his thrombocytopenia. The patient's blood glucose level is well controlled with a level of 135 mg/dL.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8 C (100.1 F)
- Heart rate: 74 bpm (range: 71-146 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 102/56 mmHg (range: 69-122/45-95 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (range: 17-30 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, and PaO2 of 117 mmHg.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his immunocompromised state, mechanical ventilation, and presence of central lines.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy with argatroban increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's significant stool output and diuresis may lead to fluid imbalances and electrolyte disturbances.
4. Organ dysfunction: The patient's altered mental status and thrombocytopenia may indicate potential organ dysfunction.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to identify any potential complications early and intervene appropriately."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock and persistently
   febrile in spite of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.  Hemodynamically
   patient is significantly improved (now off pressors), but has
   persistent daily fevers.  Renal ultrasound negative for abscess.
   Neurosurg feels VP shunt is unlikely.  Also has mechanical mitral
   valve.
   -speak with neurosurg re: tapping her VP shunt as potential source of
   infection
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   - follow UOP, bolus for low UOP
   - obtain records of prior UTIs from PCP to determine sensitivities of
   prior UTIs
   .
   2.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.
   - monitor mental status
   - consider head CT versus MRI if mental status fails to improve off
   sedation
   .
   3.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR shows pleural effusion.  Had RSB of
   47 overnight and tolerated SBT though inability to respond to commands
   remains a [**Known lastname **] to extubation.    Increased tachycardia while off
   sedation is also a [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will resume home coreg.
   - continue lasix IV 80 x 1 to diurese patient given pleural effusion
   - serial CXR
   .
   4. Elevated INR.  INR rose to >20 on admission, with mild DIC and
   recent coumadin use.  After 10 mg PO of vitamin K, INR fell to 2.4, so
   argatroban was started.  PTT is therapeutic on argatroban now.   Now
   with guaic positive stools and stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct today given newly guiaic positive stools
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold aldactone given hypotension
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   - resume coreg today

   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 61-year-old female with dilated cardiomyopathy, history of mitral valve replacement, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock and persistent fevers despite receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage for bowel pathogens and C. diff. All other cultures have been negative.

2. The patient's hemodynamics have improved, and she is no longer on pressors. However, she continues to have daily fevers. Renal ultrasound ruled out abscess, and neurosurgery believes VP shunt is unlikely to be the source of infection. The patient has a mechanical mitral valve.

3. The patient's mental status is still impaired, and she is sedated with fentanyl/versed. She is unable to follow commands. A head CT showed no changes compared to a previous one, although the patient has a large CVA and VP shunt in place. Neurosurgery feels shunt infection is less likely given its long-standing presence. The patient has been adequately anticoagulated, making embolic or thrombotic events less likely than a hemorrhagic event.

4. The patient required intubation for respiratory failure due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing. A chest X-ray revealed a pleural effusion. She tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial but remains unable to respond to commands, which is a contraindication for ext"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient had an episode of hypotension, which was treated with a NS bolus. He is currently receiving multiple medications including argatroban, midazolam, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 to 85/45 mmHg, respiratory rate between 30-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on ventilator support. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows pH 7.50, PaCO2 29, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 334. His laboratory results indicate normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt levels, but elevated Cr, TCO2, and LDH levels. The patient's glucose level is within normal range, but his electrolyte levels show abnormalities in Na+, K+, Cl-, and Mg++. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The patient's sedation and pain management are being closely monitored. The patient is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology
   on day 6 of 10 of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.   Renal ultrasound
   negative for abscess.  Neurosurg feels VP shunt is unlikely.  Also has
   mechanical mitral valve.Of note, patient has history of dental
   infection with recommendation for extraction of tooth, however, was
   deferred due to patient
s anticoagulation.  Patient is hemodynamically
   improved (off pressors for several days) and improved fever curve (now
   Afebrile for > 24 hours).  Hypotension in last 24 hours thought to be
   due to propofol use.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR shows persistent pleural effusion.
   Yesterday, inability to respond to commands made her unable to be
   extubated.  Also had tachycardia to 160s at the end of SBT concerning
   for panic attack.   Given her significant cardiomyopathy, will try to
   diurese her today to optimize her for extubation.
   - lasix 80 IV prn with goal diuresis of [**1-26**] liters per day
   - serial CXR
   .
   3.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.  Today, has improved mental
   status off sedation.  Nowe moving all extremities.  Will stop propofol
   and switch to prn fentanyl/versed given ongoing hypotension and
   difficulty successfully diuresing with her blood pressure being low.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn fentanyl,versed boluses
   .
   4. Anticoagulation.  Now on agatroban drip for mitral valve replacement
   and a. fib with therapeutic INR.  Now with guaic positive stools and
   stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - monitor Hct
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   Given low EF, will diurese patient to optimize her for extubation.
   Currently getting positive pressure from vent and there is concern that
   without positive pressure after extubation, she may go into pulmonary
   edema.  Will attempt to diurese with lasix prn.  Will stop propofol
   which is causing hypotension and limiting ability to diurese and use
   prn fentanyl/versed.
   - hold aldactone given hypotension
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   - d/c coreg today given low normal BP and normal HR today
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia is improved with D5W and free water
   boluses
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly
   .
   10. Depression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, mental status changes, anticoagulation management, dilated cardiomyopathy, rhythm disturbances, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, depression, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with signs of septic shock, but her condition has improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, there is still a concern for alternative sources of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing. Persistent pleural effusion is seen on the chest X-ray, and she may require further diuresis for extubation.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient has been sedated with fentanyl and versed, resulting in an inability to follow commands. There are concerns about a possible shunt infection or embolic/thrombotic event causing these changes.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient requires anticoagulation due to her mechanical mitral valve replacement and atrial fibrillation. Agarose drip is being used, but there is a risk of bleeding, especially with a positive guaiac positive"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with septic shock and is currently off pressors. She has a history of diarrhea, hypotension, and signs of sepsis on arrival to the emergency department. The patient's hemodynamics are improving, but she remains febrile.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient initially experienced septic shock, which has now resolved. However, hypotension this morning appears to be related to propofol. Continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure is necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and tachypnea in the emergency department. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure yesterday may have been due to agitation. The patient should continue to be closely monitored for respiratory distress, and extubation should be reevaluated later today.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has now resolved. Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential to prevent its recurrence.

4. Coronary Artery Disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. It is important to continue managing this condition with appropriate medications such as ASA and statins. Restarting coreg later today if blood pressure improves is also recommended.

5. Mechanical MVR- Argatroban: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with argatroban for anticoag"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with septic shock and is now off pressors. The patient's condition has been complicated by various factors. 

Firstly, the patient experienced an episode of hypotension this morning, which temporally appears related to propofol sedation. This indicates a potential complication related to sedation.

Secondly, the patient has been intubated for respiratory distress and tachypnea in the emergency department. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure yesterday may have been due to agitation, as the patient did well initially but then became anxious and tachycardic. This suggests a risk of extubation failure due to inadequate respiratory function.

Thirdly, the patient had hypernatremia, which has since resolved. This indicates a previous electrolyte imbalance that has been corrected.

Fourthly, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The management plan includes continuing ASA/statin, restarting digoxin, and holding coreg due to hypotension, with a plan to restart later if blood pressure improves. This suggests ongoing cardiac concerns and medication adjustments.

Fifthly, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with argatroban for mechanical mitral valve replacement. Once stabilized, the plan is to restart coumadin. This indicates the need for anticoagulation management.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise include further episodes of hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology
   on day 7 of 10 of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.   Renal ultrasound
   negative for abscess.  Neurosurg feels VP shunt is unlikely.  Also has
   mechanical mitral valve.Of note, patient has history of dental
   infection with recommendation for extraction of tooth, however, was
   deferred due to patient
s anticoagulation.  Patient is hemodynamically
   improved (off pressors for several days) and improved fever curve (now
   Afebrile for > 24 hours).  Hypotension has improved with bolus
   sedation.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  Two days ago, inability to respond to
   commands made her unable to be extubated.  Also had tachycardia to 160s
   at the end of [**Known lastname **] concerning for panic attack.  Now more responsive
   while getting bolus sedation rather than drips.    Given her
   significant cardiomyopathy, concer that she was have flash pulmonary
   edema when she is extubated when she was diuresed 1.5 liters with lasix
   80 IV x 2.
   - lasix 80 IV prn with goal diuresis of [**1-26**] liters per day
   - serial
   CXR
   - [**Date Range **] today and consider extubation
   .
   3.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.  Today, has improved mental
   status off sedation.  Nowe moving all extremities.  Will stop propofol
   and switch to prn fentanyl/versed given ongoing hypotension and
   difficulty successfully diuresing with her blood pressure being low.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn fentanyl,versed boluses
   .
   4. Anticoagulation.  Now on agatroban drip for mitral valve replacement
   and a. fib with therapeutic INR.  Now with guaic positive stools and
   stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - monitor Hct
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   Given low EF, will diurese patient to optimize her for extubation.
   Currently getting positive pressure from vent and there is concern that
   without positive pressure after extubation, she may go into pulmonary
   edema.  Will attempt to diurese with lasix prn.  Will stop propofol
   which is causing hypotension and limiting ability to diurese and use
   prn fentanyl/versed.
   - hold aldactone given hypotension
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   - d/c coreg today given low normal BP and normal HR today
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia is improved with D5W and free water
   boluses
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly
   .
   10. Depression.
   - Zoloft

7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is improved with D5W and free water boluses. Continue free water boluses and follow Na levels.

8. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine 112 mcg four times weekly, 125 mcg three times weekly.

9. Depression: The patient is on Zoloft.

10. PPI: The patient is on a PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient's medical conditions require close monitoring and management of septic shock, respiratory failure, mental status, anticoagulation, dilated cardiomyopathy, rhythm, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, depression, and stress ulcer prophylaxis."

   complication.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology
   on day 7 of 10 of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.   Renal ultrasound
   negative for abscess.  Neurosurg feels VP shunt is unlikely.  Also has
   mechanical mitral valve.Of note, patient has history of dental
   infection with recommendation for extraction of tooth, however, was
   deferred due to patient
s anticoagulation.  Patient is hemodynamically
   improved (off pressors for several days) and improved fever curve (now
   Afebrile for > 24 hours).  Hypotension has improved with bolus
   sedation.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  Two days ago, inability to respond to
   commands made her unable to be extubated.  Also had tachycardia to 160s
   at the end of [**Known lastname **] concerning for panic attack.  Now more responsive
   while getting bolus sedation rather than drips.    Given her
   significant cardiomyopathy, she was diuresed 1.5 liters with lasix 80
   IV x 2.
   - lasix 80 IV prn with goal diuresis of [**1-26**] liters per day it patient
   is not extubated today
   - serial CXR
   - [**Date Range **]
   .
   3.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.  Today, has improved mental
   status off sedation.  Nowe moving all extremities.  Will stop propofol
   and switch to prn fentanyl/versed given ongoing hypotension and
   difficulty successfully diuresing with her blood pressure being low.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn fentanyl,versed boluses
   .
   4. Anticoagulation.  Now on agatroban drip for mitral valve replacement
   and a. fib with therapeutic INR.  Now with guaic positive stools and
   stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - monitor Hct
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   Given low EF, will diurese patient to optimize her for extubation.
   Currently getting positive pressure from vent and there is concern that
   without positive pressure after extubation, she may go into pulmonary
   edema.  Will attempt to diurese with lasix prn.  Will stop propofol
   which is causing hypotension and limiting ability to diurese and use
   prn fentanyl/versed.
   - hold aldactone given hypotension
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   - d/c coreg today given low normal BP and normal HR today
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia is improved with D5W and free water
   boluses
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly
   .
   10. Depression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology on day 7 of vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. She presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. The UCx grew 6000 E. coli, leading to concerns about alternative explanations for sepsis. The patient has been hemodynamically improved and is now afebrile for over 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which has improved with appropriate antibiotic coverage. However, there is still a concern for alternative sources of infection or ongoing sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for tachypnea and increased work of breathing. She is currently more responsive and showing improvement while receiving bolus sedation rather than continuous infusions.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed and unable to follow commands. Her mental status has improved after decreasing sedation, but further assessment is needed.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient requires anticoagulation due to her mechanical mitral valve replacement and atrial fibrillation. She is currently on arg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology on day 10 of vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient has been improving hemodynamically and fever-free for over 24 hours. She remains intubated due to respiratory failure and has a persistent pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The patient's mental status has improved, but she is still sedated with fentanyl and versed. She is now moving all extremities and showing signs of improved mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, including positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. Although cultures have grown only E. coli, the patient remains on antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole) as a precautionary measure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing. She continues to have a persistent pleural effusion on chest X-ray, which could contribute to respiratory distress.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient has been sedated with fentanyl and versed, making it difficult to assess her mental status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation through CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The patient's FiO2 is set at 35% and RSBI is 63. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation as the heart rhythm.

The patient has been diuresed with two doses of IV lasix totaling 1.3 L. His sodium level has fallen to [**insert sodium level**]. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. He has received three doses of antibiotics: Vancomycin at 08:00 PM, Cefepime at 09:00 PM, and Metronidazole at 04:03 AM.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,580 mL since midnight, with total output of 4,925 mL. The patient's urine output is 4,125 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including argatroban, lansoprazole, and various ICU medications. The patient's blood products and other fluid inputs/outputs are documented.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 316 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 114 mg/dL, sodium of 0.6 mg/dL, potassium of 22 mEq/L, chloride of 3.2 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 14 mg/dL, BUN of 27.7%, creatinine of 11.8 K/uL, and blood glucose of 135 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been assessed for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and fluid overload. The patient's low sodium level may indicate the need for careful fluid management to prevent hyponatremia. Additionally, the patient's thrombocytopenia and history of allergies to heparin agents need to be considered when managing anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology
   on day 6 of 10 of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.   Renal ultrasound
   negative for abscess.  Neurosurg feels VP shunt is unlikely.  Also has
   mechanical mitral valve.Of note, patient has history of dental
   infection with recommendation for extraction of tooth, however, was
   deferred due to patient
s anticoagulation.  Patient is hemodynamically
   improved (off pressors for several days) and improved fever curve (now
   Afebrile for > 24 hours).  Hypotension in last 24 hours thought to be
   due to propofol use.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR shows persistent pleural effusion.
   Yesterday, inability to respond to commands made her unable to be
   extubated.  Also had tachycardia to 160s at the end of [**Known lastname **] concerning
   for panic attack.   Given her significant cardiomyopathy, will try to
   diurese her today to optimize her for extubation.
   - lasix 80 IV prn with goal diuresis of [**1-26**] liters per day
   - serial CXR
   .
   3.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.  Today, has improved mental
   status off sedation.  Nowe moving all extremities.  Will stop propofol
   and switch to prn fentanyl/versed given ongoing hypotension and
   difficulty successfully diuresing with her blood pressure being low.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn fentanyl,versed boluses
   .
   4. Anticoagulation.  Now on agatroban drip for mitral valve replacement
   and a. fib with therapeutic INR.  Now with guaic positive stools and
   stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - monitor Hct
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   Given low EF, will diurese patient to optimize her for extubation.
   Currently getting positive pressure from vent and there is concern that
   without positive pressure after extubation, she may go into pulmonary
   edema.  Will attempt to diurese with lasix prn.  Will stop propofol
   which is causing hypotension and limiting ability to diurese and use
   prn fentanyl/versed.
   - hold aldactone given hypotension
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   - d/c coreg today given low normal BP and normal HR today
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia is improved with D5W and free water
   boluses
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly
   .
   10. Depression.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology on day 6 of vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The initial thought was urosepsis due to positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. However, only E. coli was cultured from the urine culture, and no other cultures were positive. The possibility of alternative sources of sepsis is being considered. The patient has improved hemodynamically and fever curve but remains hypotensive. She is being covered for bowel pathogens and Clostridium difficile with metronidazole.

She also has respiratory failure due to persistent pleural effusion seen on chest X-ray. She was intubated for tachypnea and increased work of breathing. She had a panic attack with tachycardia to 160s at the end of the last note, making extubation unsuccessful. Diuretics will be used to optimize her for extubation.

The patient's mental status has improved after decreasing sedation. She has been adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay, making embolic or thrombotic event less likely than a hemorrhagic event. Her large cerebrovascular accident (CVA)"

   complication.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology
   on day 7 of 10 of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.   Renal ultrasound
   negative for abscess.  Neurosurg feels VP shunt is unlikely.  Also has
   mechanical mitral valve.Of note, patient has history of dental
   infection with recommendation for extraction of tooth, however, was
   deferred due to patient
s anticoagulation.  Patient is hemodynamically
   improved (off pressors for several days) and improved fever curve (now
   Afebrile for > 24 hours).  Hypotension has improved with bolus
   sedation.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  Two days ago, inability to respond to
   commands made her unable to be extubated.  Also had tachycardia to 160s
   at the end of [**Known lastname **] concerning for panic attack.  Now more responsive
   while getting bolus sedation rather than drips.    Given her
   significant cardiomyopathy, concer that she was have flash pulmonary
   edema when she is extubated when she was diuresed 1.5 liters with lasix
   80 IV x 2.
   - lasix 80 IV prn with goal diuresis of [**1-26**] liters per day
   - serial
   CXR
   - [**Date Range **] today and consider extubation
   .
   3.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.  Today, has improved mental
   status off sedation.  Nowe moving all extremities.  Will stop propofol
   and switch to prn fentanyl/versed given ongoing hypotension and
   difficulty successfully diuresing with her blood pressure being low.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn fentanyl,versed boluses
   .
   4. Anticoagulation.  Now on agatroban drip for mitral valve replacement
   and a. fib with therapeutic INR.  Now with guaic positive stools and
   stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - monitor Hct
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   Given low EF, will diurese patient to optimize her for extubation.
   Currently getting positive pressure from vent and there is concern that
   without positive pressure after extubation, she may go into pulmonary
   edema.  Will attempt to diurese with lasix prn.  Will stop propofol
   which is causing hypotension and limiting ability to diurese and use
   prn fentanyl/versed.
   - hold aldactone, coreg for now, but consider resuming in future
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia is improved with D5W and free water
   boluses.  Will d/c d5w and free water boluses.
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   8.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly
   .
   9. Depression.
   - Zoloft
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, previous mitral valve replacement, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology on day 10 of vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl. She presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli. The patient is now hemodynamically improved, with improved fever curve, and hypotension has improved with bolus sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, and although she is currently hemodynamically improved, there is still a risk of complications associated with sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing. There is concern about the possibility of flash pulmonary edema when she is extubated, especially considering her significant cardiomyopathy.
3. Mental status changes: The patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with inability to follow commands. Mental status improvement has been observed after decreasing sedation, but further monitoring is required.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient is on argatroban for mitral valve replacement and atrial fibrillation with therapeutic INR. There is a risk of bleeding, especially"

   unchanged since yesterday's examination.
   2. Support tubes and lines grossly unchanged, without evident
   complication.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology
   on day 6 of 10 of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.   Renal ultrasound
   negative for abscess.  Neurosurg feels VP shunt is unlikely.  Also has
   mechanical mitral valve.Of note, patient has history of dental
   infection with recommendation for extraction of tooth, however, was
   deferred due to patient
s anticoagulation.  Patient is hemodynamically
   improved (off pressors for several days) and improved fever curve (now
   Afebrile for > 24 hours).  Hypotension in last 24 hours thought to be
   due to propofol use.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  CXR shows persistent pleural effusion.
   Yesterday, inability to respond to commands made her unable to be
   extubated.  Also had tachycardia to 160s at the end of [**Known lastname **] concerning
   for panic attack.   Given her significant cardiomyopathy, will try to
   diurese her today to optimize her for extubation.
   - lasix 80 IV prn with goal diuresis of [**1-26**] liters per day
   - serial CXR
   .
   3.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.  Today, has improved mental
   status off sedation.  Nowe moving all extremities.  Will stop propofol
   and switch to prn fentanyl/versed given ongoing hypotension and
   difficulty successfully diuresing with her blood pressure being low.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn fentanyl,versed boluses
   .
   4. Anticoagulation.  Now on agatroban drip for mitral valve replacement
   and a. fib with therapeutic INR.  Now with guaic positive stools and
   stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - monitor Hct
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   Given low EF, will diurese patient to optimize her for extubation.
   Currently getting positive pressure from vent and there is concern that
   without positive pressure after extubation, she may go into pulmonary
   edema.  Will attempt to diurese with lasix prn.  Will stop propofol
   which is causing hypotension and limiting ability to diurese and use
   prn fentanyl/versed.
   - hold aldactone given hypotension
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   - d/c coreg today given low normal BP and normal HR today
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia is improved with D5W and free water
   boluses
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   -  levothyroxine  112 4x weekly, 125 3x weekly
   .
   10. Depression.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. She was admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology on day 10 of vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. The initial presentation included positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. However, subsequent cultures only grew 6000 E. coli, and other cultures were negative. Renal ultrasound did not show any abscess, and the neurosurgeon feels that the VP shunt is unlikely as a source of infection. The patient has a history of dental infection but could not undergo tooth extraction due to anticoagulation.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to persistent pleural effusion. She was also sedated with fentanyl and versed, which has caused an inability to follow commands. Her mental status has improved after decreasing sedation, and she is now able to move all extremities. She will be weaned off propofol and switched to prn fentanyl/versed.

The patient is currently on argatroban for anticoagulation due to mechanical mitral valve replacement and atrial fibrillation. She has been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. She is planned for diuresis to optimize her for extubation, as there is concern for pulmonary edema without positive pressure. Lasix 80 IV will be given prn for diuresis.

The patient has rhythm disturbances, including ectopy on telemetry, and an ICD is in place. She also has hypernatremia, which is being managed with D5W and free water boluses. She has multiple medical conditions, including hypothyroidism, depression, and a history of dental infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Despite coverage with appropriate antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for sepsis due to the unclear etiology and ongoing presence of fever.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a concern for persistent pleural effusion and potential post-extubation pulmonary edema.
3. Mental status changes: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen due to the ongoing sedation and the presence of multiple comorbidities.
4. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction puts her at risk for further cardiac deterioration and potential heart failure.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels require careful management to prevent complications such as neurologic dysfunction.
7. Infection: Despite negative cultures, there remains a concern for ongoing infection, particularly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with diarrhea, pyelonephritis, and septic shock. Her hemodynamics have improved, but she still experiences persistent respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 100/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature of 36.9°C. She has a history of coronary artery disease/nonischemic cardiomyopathy and is being treated with aspirin, prevacid, colace, levothyroxine, zoloft, senna, reglan, digoxin, and neutrophil. She also has a mechanical mitral valve and is on anticoagulation therapy with argatroban. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging reveals resolved pleural effusions compared to yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is a significant concern. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) should be conducted to assess her ability to wean off mechanical ventilation.
2. Septic Shock: Although the patient's hemodynamics have improved, there is a risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with diarrhea, pyelonephritis, and septic shock. She has improved hemodynamics but continues to experience respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 100/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is a concern. Continuous monitoring and optimization of ventilator settings are necessary. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) has been initiated to assess her ability to breathe independently.

2. Urosepsis: The patient initially presented with pyelonephritis, which likely led to urosepsis and subsequent septic shock. It is crucial to continue administering appropriate antibiotics to prevent further complications.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had hypernatremia, but it has since resolved. However, close monitoring of electrolyte levels should be maintained to avoid any future imbalances.

4. Coronary Artery Disease/Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Continued management with ASA, statin, and digoxin is necessary. Coreg should be restarted if blood pressure improves later today.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology
   on day 8 of 10 of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.   Renal ultrasound
   negative for abscess.  Neurosurg feels VP shunt infection is unlikely.
   Also has mechanical mitral valve.Of note, patient has history of dental
   infection with recommendation for extraction of tooth, however, was
   deferred due to patient
s anticoagulation.  Patient is hemodynamically
   improved (off pressors for several days) and improved fever curve (now
   Afebrile for > 24 hours).  Hypotension resolved.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for 10 day course (day 8 today)
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  Has pulm edema
several liters positive
   for LOS, and has EF = 10%
   - lasix 80 IV prn with goal diuresis of [**1-26**] liters per day
   -consider restarting aldactone tomorrow
   -d/c aline today
   .
   3.  Mental status- had decreased MS, likely [**2-26**] sedation, now at
   baseline s/p extubation.
   -follow
   .
   4. Anticoagulation.  Now on agatroban drip for mitral valve replacement
   and a. fib with therapeutic INR.  Now with guaic positive stools and
   stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - monitor Hct
   -restart coumadin today
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   - hold aldactone for today, restart tomorrow if able
   -restart low dose coreg today, titrate up as tol (start 6.25 [**Hospital1 **], on
   25BID at home)
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia is resolved with D5W and free water
   boluses.  Will d/c d5w and free water boluses.
   - advance to regular diet
   - follow Na

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), previous mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease, subdural hematoma, and VP shunt. The patient was admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology on day 10 of vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Septic Shock: The patient presented with positive urine analysis, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis. Although initially thought to be due to urosepsis, UCx only grew 6000 E. coli. There is concern for an alternative explanation of sepsis, but no clear alternative source has been identified. The patient is currently being covered for bowel pathogens and Clostridium difficile with flagyl. All other cultures have been negative. Renal ultrasound was negative for abscess, and neurosurgery feels VP shunt infection is unlikely.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for tachypnea and increased work of breathing. She has pulmonary edema several liters positive for leukocyte esterase, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The plan is to continue with IV lasix 80 prn with the goal of diuresis of 1-26 liters"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5130**] is a 61 yo female  with dilated cardiomyopathy
   (non-ischemic), s/p MVR for rheumatic heart disease, h/o subdural
   hematoma and VP shunt, admitted with septic shock of unclear etiology
   on day 8 of 10 of vanco/cefepime/flagyl.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient presented with positive UA, fever, elevated
   WBC, and radiographic evidence of pyelonephritis which initially
   thought to be due to urosepsis.  However, UCx grew only 6000 E. coli.
   Concerning for alternative explanation of sepsis, though no clear
   alternative source.  Being covered for bowel pathogens and c. diff with
   flagyl.  All other cultures have been negative.   Renal ultrasound
   negative for abscess.  Neurosurg feels VP shunt infection is unlikely.
   Also has mechanical mitral valve.Of note, patient has history of dental
   infection with recommendation for extraction of tooth, however, was
   deferred due to patient
s anticoagulation.  Patient is hemodynamically
   improved (off pressors for several days) and improved fever curve (now
   Afebrile for > 24 hours).  Hypotension resolved.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for 10 day course
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.   Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing.  Two days ago, inability to respond to
   commands made her unable to be extubated.  Also had tachycardia to 160s
   at the end of SBT concerning for panic attack.  Now more responsive
   while getting bolus sedation rather than drips.    Given her
   significant cardiomyopathy, concer that she was have flash pulmonary
   edema when she is extubated when she was diuresed 1.5 liters with lasix
   80 IV x 2.
   - lasix 80 IV prn with goal diuresis of [**1-26**] liters per day
   - serial
   CXR
   - SBT today and consider extubation
   .
   3.  Mental status.  Patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed with
   inability to follow commands at present.  Will assess mental status
   after decreasing her sedation.  Head CT obtained 24 hours after
   admission appeared to be unchanged, though patient has large CVA and a
   VP shunt in place.  Neurosurg feels shunt infection is less likely
   given that it has been in place for several years.  Patient has been
   adequately anticoagulated during ICU stay making embolic or thrombotic
   event less likely than a hemorrhagic event.  Today, has improved mental
   status off sedation.  Nowe moving all extremities.  Will stop propofol
   and switch to prn fentanyl/versed given ongoing hypotension and
   difficulty successfully diuresing with her blood pressure being low.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn fentanyl,versed boluses
   .
   4. Anticoagulation.  Now on agatroban drip for mitral valve replacement
   and a. fib with therapeutic INR.  Now with guaic positive stools and
   stable hematocrit.
   - follow serial coags
   - continue argatroban for anticoagulation and hold off on resuming
   coumadin in case she requires a procedure while in ICU
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   - monitor Hct
   5.   Dilated cardiomyopathy.   Patient reportedly has a non-ischemic
   dilated cardiomyopathy with most recent echo showing an EF of 10%.
   Patient also s/p mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic fever.
   Given low EF, will diurese patient to optimize her for extubation.
   Currently getting positive pressure from vent and there is concern that
   without positive pressure after extubation, she may go into pulmonary
   edema.  Will attempt to diurese with lasix prn.  Will stop propofol
   which is causing hypotension and limiting ability to diurese and use
   prn fentanyl/versed.
   - hold aldactone, coreg for now, but consider resuming in future
   - continue lasix 80 IV x 1 for diuresis
   .
   6.  Rhythm.  Patient still with ectopy on telemetry but decreased from
   prior.  Patient has ICD in place.  Increased tachycardia when sedation
   is lightened.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - replete lytes
   .
   7.  Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia is improved with D5W and free water
   boluses.  Will d/c d5w and free water boluses.
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na
