   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but now
   suspicious for pneumonia.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Overnight, the patient had recurrent of dyspnea. Repeat CXR
   showed a more clear left-sided infiltrate. Also, of note, pt had fevers
   overnight. This presentation now more consistent with pneumonia, with a
   possible superimposed CHF component. Pt given
   vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin yesterday evening.
   - vanc/cefepime/azithromycin for broad coverage for pneumonia
   -
   - holding on further antibiotics at this time, as pt does not
   clinically appear to have a pneumonia
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 mg daily
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Pt
   denies any current chest pain, and the first set of CE's was negative.
   Of note, the patient did report some chest pressure last night and in
   the ED this morning, but this has since resolved.
   - will continue to rule out MI with 3 sets of CE's
   - continue to monitor for any chest pain
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on coumadin. His
   INR is currently therapeutic at 2.3. Telemetry currently showing
   v-paced rhythm.
   - continue coumadin, with goal INR of 2.3
   - need to closely monitor INR, as it may change at patient received
   levofloxacin in the ED
   .
   # Hypertension: Normotensive at this time.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate
   - lasix bolus PRN
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Pt currently near his baseline.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   - bowel regimen with colace/senna
   .
   # ID: Per o/p ID notes, the patient is on chornic cefpodoxime for
   ongoing suppression after high-grade viridans streptococcal bacteremia
   in the setting of pacer/defibrillator wires and to continue intended
   life-long suppression for suspected Klebsiella pneumoniae lead
   endocarditis during a prior bacteremia.
   - continue cefpodoxime
   .
   # S/p Whipple:
   - continue pancreatic enzyme repletion

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and treatments. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea and required BiPAP support. A chest X-ray revealed an infiltrate on the left side, leading to the administration of cefepime (an antibiotic) to address potential pneumonia.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and Ambien, which should be taken into consideration during medication administration. The patient is also receiving furosemide (Lasix) for an unknown reason. 

The vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and an average temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius (100.1 degrees Fahrenheit). The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated at 93 beats per minute, with a blood pressure of 104/61 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 95%. The patient is being paced at a heart rate of 70-98 beats per minute.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 2,520 mL in 24 hours. The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen through a neb device and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 541 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for a chief complaint of dyspnea, likely due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient has also reported recent dietary indiscretion, increased leg edema, dyspnea on exertion, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He self-increased his oral lasix dose with little effect and has a B-type natriuretic peptide level of approximately 3000. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 100%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 80. The patient has crackles and scattered wheezes in both lungs, and a potential left lower lobe op"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea, likely due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation. 

The patient reports recent dietary indiscretion, increased leg edema, dyspnea on exertion (DOE), and orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat) recently. He also self-increased his oral lasix dose this week with little effect. The patient's brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is approximately 3000, indicating a likely exacerbation of his congestive heart failure. 

A chest X-ray showed potential left lower lobe opacification, but pneumonia seems unlikely as the patient does not have a fever or leukocytosis. The patient responded well to intravenous lasix in the emergency department, and his intake/output (I/O) status will be monitored closely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, presented to the emergency department with dyspnea.
- The initial assessment suggested a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure, but there are now signs consistent with pneumonia, possibly with a superimposed CHF component.
- The patient has been given broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin, and attempts are being made to obtain sputum cultures.
- Other ongoing treatments include restarting Lasix to prevent CHF exacerbation, continuing metoprolol, and monitoring for any chest pain to rule out myocardial infarction.
- The patient's rhythm is currently ventricular-paced, and his INR is therapeutic at 2.3. Coumadin will be continued with close monitoring of INR due to potential changes with antibiotic use.
- The patient's hypertension is currently normotensive, and he will continue on metoprolol and Lasix.
- Other medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, anemia, and ID-related issues will also be managed accordingly.
- ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in 2006, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, for which he has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea, initially thought to be due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation, but now suspected to be pneumonia. The patient also has a history of anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and was previously diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae endocarditis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and is on BiPAP support. His physical examination reveals bilateral crackles and coarse breath sounds, indicating possible pulmonary edema or pneumonia. The patient's cardiac examination is difficult to hear due to breath sounds, but there is no murmur or gallop appreciated. The abdomen is described as obese, soft, and without tenderness or hernia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history of systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation but is now more consistent with pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure/pneumonia, hypotension/sepsis, chronic systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, s/p ICD, hypothyroidism, anemia, and chronic antibiotic use. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for hypoxemia, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and being treated for hypotension with IV fluids and norepinephrine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, exacerbation of heart failure, arrhythmias, and further infections. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, fluid balance, and antibiotic therapy will be crucial in managing these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but now suspected to be pneumonia. Overnight, the patient had recurrent dyspnea and repeat chest X-ray showed a more clear left-sided infiltrate. The patient also had fevers overnight. This presentation is now more consistent with pneumonia, possibly with a superimposed congestive heart failure component. The patient was given vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin yesterday evening. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin were initiated for pneumonia coverage. Sputum cultures were attempted. Lasix 60 mg PO daily was restarted to prevent CHF exacerbation on top of pneumonia. Metoprolol 12.5 mg daily was continued per home medication list.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias due to the patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.
2. Pneumonia progression or worsening due to the presence of bilateral crackles and coarse breath sounds, as well as the development of fevers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia. However, it was later determined that the patient also had a superimposed component of pneumonia with hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin for broad-spectrum coverage, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, aspirin for coronary artery disease, and warfarin for atrial fibrillation. He also has a history of chronic antibiotic use for suppression of ongoing bacterial infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is important to monitor his response to the antibiotics and watch for any signs of worsening infection or development of drug-resistant organisms.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count, there is a concern for sepsis, possibly secondary to the pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and organ function is necessary to"

His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 76-47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a history of chronic antibiotic use, including cefpodoxime for ongoing suppression after high-grade viridans streptococcal bacteremia and suspected Klebsiella pneumoniae lead endocarditis. He also has a history of Whipple's disease, but did not initiate tube feeds. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including aspirin, levothyroxine, iron supplementation, and metoprolol.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, for which he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implanted. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to be experiencing a congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia. He was intubated due to hypoxemia and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemic respiratory failure/pneumonia, hypotension/sepsis, chronic systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, ICD implantation with high impedance and left ventricular lead dysfunction, hypothyroidism, anemia, and chronic antibiotic use.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms consistent with pneumonia, such as fever, cough, and left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. If left untreated, this could lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.

2. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, including hypotension and tachycardia. If not promptly treated, sepsis can progress to severe seps"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history, including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in [**26**], paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation status post implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/Pneumonia: The patient has fever, cough, dyspnea, left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. He is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for broad coverage. Mechanical ventilation is continued, and a trial of pressure support may be considered if the patient becomes more alert. Chest CT is planned to better evaluate lung fields.

2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's blood pressures have been high 90s to low 100s. He is likely suffering from [**1-24**] pneumonia. Levophed is being used for pressor support, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is 6-9, suggesting not volume up. Weaning of levo as tolerated is planned. Met"

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in [**26**], paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white blood count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia and is now requiring increasing oxygen. A chest CT shows bilateral non-hemorrhagic small-to-moderate pleural effusions, minimally loculated, if at all, on the right, severe lower lobe, and moderate upper lobe atelectasis. The CT initially read as pneumonia but was later reinterpreted to exclude pneumonia. The patient will complete the course of antibiotics.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure and is hypervolemic. Diuretics will be continued with the goal of negative 2 L today, and metoprolol will be restarted. Coronary artery disease is present, and the patient had an anterior wall myocardial infarction in [**2126**]. Aspirin and simvastatin will be continued. The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history including systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia. However, further evaluation revealed hypoxemic respiratory failure, and the patient was intubated for hypoxemia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires vasopressors. His heart function is compromised with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. The patient also has a history of chronic antibiotic use for suppression of ongoing infections and is currently on cefepime per Infectious Disease consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation suggested pneumonia, which is a common complication in ICU patients. His symptoms include fever, cough, and infiltrate on chest X-ray. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient's response to treatment should be closely monitored.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible sepsis. This is a serious condition that can lead to organ"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea. Initial assessment suggested a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure with infiltrate and fever, but subsequent investigations revealed hypoxemic respiratory failure with atelectasis/effusion on chest CT. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25% and is hypervolemic. He has a history of an anterior wall myocardial infarction in 2016 and is currently on aspirin and simvastatin. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is taking coumadin, and his INR is currently therapeutic at 2.3. He is also on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and iron supplementation for anemia. 

The patient has undergone Whipple's procedure and is currently on tube feeds, but pancreatic enzyme repletion has been difficult to administer through the tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement indicates worsening respiratory function, which could progress to severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea, initially thought to be a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate and fever, but later diagnosed as pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxemia and is now requiring an increased amount of supplemental oxygen (FiO2 50%). A chest CT shows atelectasis/effusion rather than pneumonia, but the patient will complete the course of antibiotics. Mechanical ventilation will be continued.

2. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 20-25%. He is currently hypervolemic and will undergo diuresis with the goal of being negative 2 liters by the end of the day. Metoprolol will be restarted if tolerated, and Coumadin will be restarted with a therapeutic INR.

3. Coronaries: The patient has a history of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. His chest pressure has resolved, and three sets of cardiac enzymes have ruled out a new myocardial infarction. Aspirin and simvastatin will be continued.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, heart failure, and sepsis. The patient's temperature has been elevated, reaching up to 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit. He has been pan cultured and placed on a cooling blanket. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and Ambien. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and meropenem. The patient is also receiving fentanyl for pain management, lansoprazole for acid reflux, heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). His creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range, as well as calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++) levels. Lactic acid levels are slightly elevated at 1.6 mmol/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Pt noted to have an elevated in CK on labwork yesterday.
   Not likely cardiac in nature, as MB is normal. Serotonin syndrome is a
   possibility in this patient on fentanyl and with high fevers. However,
   physical exam not consistent with serotonin syndrome. Also, the patient
   has been on fentanyl for some time, and you would expect this to have
   shown up sooner. Likely this is mild rhabdomyolysis in the setting of
   prolonged hospitalization and sedation. Pt was given 500 cc overnight
   to help prevent renal damage from the elevated CK. CK trending down
   this morning.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Chest CT more consistent with atelectasis/effusion rather than
   pneumonia.  Oxygenation improving.  Right side clearing
   radiographically as of yesterday.  Suspect multifactorial etiology of
   CHF + pneumonia. Of note, pt spiked high temperatures yesterday despite
   being on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. Started on a cooling blanket and
   switched to meropenem
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   - consider bronch today
   .
   # Fever: Likely source is pneumonia, although differential includes
   worsening of known ICD infection. Unclear why patient is continuing to
   spike fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics. After spike to
   103.8 yesterday, ID was consulted. One concern would be for empyema,
   although lack of pleural enhancement of chest CT argues against this.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy, per ID recs
   - f/u respiratory viral screen
   - f/u repeat CXR this AM
   - consider bronch
   - continue cooling blanket PRN
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   hypervolemic. Was being diuresed with goal negative 1-2 L. However,
   ended up getting some fluid overnight [**1-24**] elevated CK.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Infection is likely
   cause, although it is also possible that patient
s hyperglycemic is
   related to infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue basal insulin that was added yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   - heparin SQ for DVT ppx while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea. The initial assessment suggested a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure with pneumonia. However, a chest CT revealed atelectasis/effusion rather than pneumonia. The patient was intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures indicate a possible hospital-acquired infection, leading to the decision to switch to meropenem monotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Elevated Creatine Kinase (CK): The patient has an elevated CK level, which is not likely of cardiac origin as the MB fraction is normal. Rhabdomyolysis is a possibility in this case, possibly due to prolonged hospitalization and sedation. The patient received IV fluids overnight to prevent renal damage from the elevated CK.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxemia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Oxygenation is improving, and the right side is clearing radiographically. The multifactorial etiology of CHF + pneumonia is suspected.
3. Fever: The patient continues to spike fevers despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Pt noted to have an elevated in CK on labwork yesterday.
   Not likely cardiac in nature, as MB is normal. Serotonin syndrome is a
   possibility in this patient on fentanyl and with high fevers. However,
   physical exam not consistent with serotonin syndrome. Also, the patient
   has been on fentanyl for some time, and you would expect this to have
   shown up sooner. Another possibility is rhabdomyolysis in the setting
   of infection. At this point, etiology not clear. Pt was given 500 cc
   overnight to help prevent renal damage from the elevated CK. CK
   trending down this morning.
   - continue to trend CK
   - IV fluids as needed to promote elimination of CK
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Chest CT more consistent with atelectasis/effusion rather than
   pneumonia.  Oxygenation improving.  Right side clearing
   radiographically as of yesterday.  Suspect multifactorial etiology of
   CHF + pneumonia. Of note, pt spiked high temperatures yesterday despite
   being on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. Started on a cooling blanket and
   switched to meropenem
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   - consider bronch today
   .
   # Fever: Likely source is pneumonia, although differential includes
   worsening of known ICD infection. Unclear why patient is continuing to
   spike fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics. After spike to
   103.8 yesterday, ID was consulted. One concern would be for empyema,
   although lack of pleural enhancement of chest CT argues against this.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy, per ID recs
   - f/u respiratory viral screen
   - f/u repeat CXR this AM
   - consider bronch
   - continue cooling blanket
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   hypervolemic. Was being diuresed with goal negative 1-2 L. However,
   ended up getting some fluid overnight [**1-24**] elevated CK.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Infection is likely
   cause, although it is also possible that patient
s hyperglycemic is
   related to infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue basal insulin that was added yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   - heparin SQ for DVT ppx while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in 2006, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation post implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Elevated CK: The patient has an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level, which is not likely cardiac in nature as the MB fraction is normal. This could be due to rhabdomyolysis in the setting of prolonged hospitalization and sedation. The patient received 500 cc of fluids overnight to prevent renal damage from the elevated CK. CK is trending down this morning.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxemia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Oxygenation is improving, and there is suspicion of multifactorial etiology of CHF + pneumonia. The patient's chest CT shows atelectasis/effusion rather than pneumonia.
3. Fever: The patient continues to have fevers despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The likely source of fever is pneumonia, but other potential causes include worsening of known ICD infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea. The initial assessment suggested a possible congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the patient continued to spike fevers, leading to a switch in antibiotics to meropenem. The chest CT showed atelectasis/effusion rather than pneumonia, and the patient's oxygenation is improving. The patient's elevated CK levels were noted, and further investigation is ongoing to determine the cause, with possibilities including serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, or renal damage.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25% and is currently hypervolemic. Lasix was administered to promote diuresis. The patient also has a history of hyperglycemia, which may be due to infection or medication infusion in D5W. Insulin sliding scale and basal insulin were initiated.

The patient has a history of an anterior wall myocardial infarction, and his coronary arteries are currently being managed with aspirin, simvastatin"

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate,fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Chest CT more consistent with atelectasis/effusion rather than
   pneumonia.  Oxygenation improving.  Right side clearing
   radiographically.  Suspect multifactorial etiology of CHF + pneumonia.
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with minimized sedation and daily
   spontaneous breathing trials
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl. Course of azithromycin is
   complete.
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   - appreciate pulmonary consult recs
   - diuresis as below
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   hypervolemic.
   - continue diuresis with goal negative 1-2 L today
   - uptitrate metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**] dosing
   .
   # Fever: Likely source is pneumonia, although differential includes
   worsening of known ICD infection. Unclear why patient is continuing to
   spike fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics.  One concern would
   be for empyema, although lack of pleural enhancement of chest CT argues
   against this.
   - trend fever curves
   - Tylenol
   - antibiotics as above
   - consider ID consult
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Infection is likely
   cause, although it is also possible that patient
s hyperglycemic is
   related to infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - add basal insulin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - uptitrate metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # Chronic antibiotic use: Per o/p ID notes, the patient is on chornic
   cefpodoxime for ongoing suppression after high-grade viridans
   streptococcal bacteremia in the setting of pacer/defibrillator wires
   and to continue intended life-long suppression for suspected Klebsiella
   pneumoniae lead endocarditis during a prior bacteremia. On cefepime per
   ID.
   - holding cefpodoxime while on broad spectrum abx as above
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia. However, the chest CT showed atelectasis/effusion rather than pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, fever (likely due to pneumonia), hyperglycemia (possibly related to infection or medication), and anemia (with a baseline Hct of 33-35%). The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin with subtherapeutic INR levels. His ICD is currently not functioning properly due to high impedance and LV lead dysfunction. The patient is also being treated for chronic antibiotic use, s/p Whipple's procedure, and has a history of hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Chest CT more consistent with atelectasis/effusion rather than
   pneumonia.  Oxygenation improving.  Right side clearing
   radiographically.  Suspect multifactorial etiology of CHF + pneumonia.
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with minimized sedation and daily
   spontaneous breathing trials
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl. Course of azithromycin is
   complete.
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)

   # Fever: Likely source is pneumonia, although differential includes
   worsening of known ICD infection. Unclear why patient is continuing to
   spike fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics.  One concern would
   be for empyema, although lack of pleural enhancement of chest CT argues
   against this.
   - trend fever curves
   - Tylenol
   - antibiotics as above

   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Infection is likely
   cause, although it is also possible that patient
s hyperglycemic is
   related to infusion of meds in D5W.

   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - uptitrate metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white blood count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient was intubated on day 3 for hypoxemia and chest CT showed atelectasis/effusion rather than pneumonia. Oxygenation has been improving, with right-sided clearing radiographically. The patient's condition is suspected to be multifactorial, involving both congestive heart failure and pneumonia.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl, aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol, and levothyroxine. He is also on chronic cefpodoxime for ongoing suppression after high-grade viridans streptococcal bacteremia in the setting of pacer/defibrillator wires and to continue intended life-long suppression for suspected Klebsiella pneumoniae lead endocarditis during a prior bacteremia. However, the cefpodoxime is being held while on broad-spectrum antibiotics as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea. He was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia. The patient was intubated on day 3 for hypoxemia, likely due to pneumonia and heart failure. His respiratory status has been improving clinically and radiographically. The main barrier to extubation is sedation.

The patient continues to experience fever despite Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory status. The source of the fever is unclear, and further investigations such as CT abdomen/pelvis and CT sinuses are planned. The patient's chronic systolic heart failure is being managed with close monitoring of fluid status, continued metoprolol, and holding diuretics today.

The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) level is likely caused by statin therapy, possibly exacerbated by concurrent azithromycin therapy. The CK is trending down, and no further IV fluids are being given at this point as CK is not at a significant enough level to cause renal failure. The statin therapy is being held.

The patient also has hyperglycemia without a known history of diabetes. Contributing factors include stress response"

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Pt noted to have an elevated in CK on labwork yesterday.
   Not likely cardiac in nature, as MB is normal. Serotonin syndrome is a
   possibility in this patient on fentanyl and with high fevers. However,
   physical exam not consistent with serotonin syndrome. Also, the patient
   has been on fentanyl for some time, and you would expect this to have
   shown up sooner. Likely this is mild rhabdomyolysis in the setting of
   prolonged hospitalization and sedation. Pt was given 500 cc overnight
   to help prevent renal damage from the elevated CK. CK trending down
   this morning.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Chest CT more consistent with atelectasis/effusion rather than
   pneumonia.  Oxygenation improving.  Right side clearing
   radiographically as of yesterday.  Suspect multifactorial etiology of
   CHF + pneumonia. Of note, pt spiked high temperatures yesterday despite
   being on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. Started on a cooling blanket and
   switched to meropenem
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   - consider bronch today
   .
   # Fever: Likely source is pneumonia, although differential includes
   worsening of known ICD infection. Unclear why patient is continuing to
   spike fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics. After spike to
   103.8 yesterday, ID was consulted. One concern would be for empyema,
   although lack of pleural enhancement of chest CT argues against this.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy, per ID recs
   - f/u respiratory viral screen
   - f/u repeat CXR this AM
   - consider bronch
   - continue cooling blanket PRN
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   hypervolemic. Was being diuresed with goal negative 1-2 L. However,
   ended up getting some fluid overnight [**1-24**] elevated CK.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Infection is likely
   cause, although it is also possible that patient
s hyperglycemic is
   related to infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue basal insulin that was added yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   - heparin SQ for DVT ppx while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient has been intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Oxygenation is improving, and there is clearing of right-sided radiographic findings. The chest CT is more consistent with atelectasis/effusion rather than pneumonia. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and now meropenem. There are pending cultures, and a bronchoscopy is being considered.

The patient continues to spike fevers despite being on antibiotics, which raises concerns for empyema or other sources of infection. The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) level is likely due to rhabdomyolysis secondary to prolonged hospitalization and sedation, rather than cardiac or serotonin syndrome-related causes. The CK level is trending down after receiving "

He presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The etiology of respiratory failure is likely pneumonia combined with heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Main barrier to extubation is
   sedation.  s/p bronchoscopy/BAL [**2141-3-11**].
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials, including this p.m.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   has continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics,
   and improvement in respiratory status. ID following.
   - CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic to hypovolemic.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding diuresis today
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Infection is likely
   cause, although it is also possible that patient
s hyperglycemic is
   related to infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue basal insulin that was added yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   - heparin SQ for DVT ppx while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxemia, likely secondary to pneumonia and heart failure. Respiratory status is improving clinically and radiographically. The main barrier to extubation is sedation. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on [2141-3-11].
   - Continue mechanical ventilation with daily spontaneous breathing trials, including this evening.
   - Continue meropenem monotherapy.
   - Follow up pending cultures (no positive microbial data to date).

2. Fever: The source of fever is unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but the patient continues to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory status. Infectious disease (ID) following.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis and CT sinuses.
   - Continue meropenem monotherapy.
   - Follow up ID recommendations.

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Main barrier to extubation is
   sedation.  s/p bronchoscopy/BAL [**2141-3-11**].
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials
   - too sedated on exam this morning, will defer extubation
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   has continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics,
   and improvement in respiratory status. ID following. CT abd/pelvis and
   CT sinuses were negative by prelim read.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic to hypovolemic.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Contributing factors
   include stress response to infection, h/o pancreatic resection,
   infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue basal insulin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   - heparin SQ for DVT ppx while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in '[**26**]', paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, for which he was intubated on [**3-4**]. The etiology is likely pneumonia plus heart failure. His respiratory status is improving clinically and radiographically. The main barrier to extubation is sedation. He underwent bronchoscopy/BAL on [**2141-3-11**]. 

The patient also has a fever, with an unclear source. Initially, it was attributed to pneumonia, but the patient continues to spike high fevers despite Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory status. Infectious disease is following up with imaging studies. 

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He is euvolemic to hypovolemic.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Main barrier to extubation is
   sedation.  s/p bronchoscopy/BAL [**2141-3-11**].
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials, including this p.m.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   has continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics,
   and improvement in respiratory status. ID following.
   - CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic to hypovolemic.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding diuresis today
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Contributing factors
   include stress response to infection, h/o pancreatic resection,
   infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue basal insulin that was added yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   - heparin SQ for DVT ppx while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Main barrier to extubation is
   sedation.  s/p bronchoscopy/BAL [**2141-3-11**].
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials, including this p.m.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   has continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics,
   and improvement in respiratory status. ID following.
   - CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic to hypovolemic.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding diuresis today
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Contributing factors
   include stress response to infection, h/o pancreatic resection,
   infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue basal insulin that was added yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   - heparin SQ for DVT ppx while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia. He was intubated for hypoxemia and received bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with daily spontaneous breathing trials. He is being treated with meropenem monotherapy for suspected pneumonia. Despite improvement in respiratory status, the patient continues to have high fevers, and the source of fever is unclear. Imaging studies have been ordered to investigate further. 

The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He is euvolemic to hypovolemic. His fluid status is being closely monitored, and diuretics are being held. 

The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels are likely caused by statin therapy, possibly exacerbated by concurrent azithromycin therapy. The CK levels are trending down. 

Hyperglycemia is present, possibly due to the stress response to infection, history"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Main barrier to extubation is
   sedation.  s/p bronchoscopy/BAL [**2141-3-11**].
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials
   - too sedated on exam this morning, will defer extubation
   - continue meropenem monotherapy

   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   has continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics,
   and improvement in respiratory status. ID following. CT abd/pelvis and
   CT sinuses were negative by prelim read.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u ID recs

   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history, including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after ICD implantation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxemia, and the etiology is likely pneumonia and heart failure. His respiratory status has improved clinically and radiographically, but sedation remains a barrier to extubation.
2. Fever: The source of the fever is unclear. It was initially attributed to pneumonia, but the patient continues to spike high fevers despite Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory status. The ID team is following up, and pending cultures are being monitored.
3. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has an ejection fraction of 20-25%. His fluid status is being closely monitored, and he is currently euvolemic to hypovolemic. Metoprolol therapy is continued.
4. Elevated CK: The elevated creatine kinase (CK) level is likely caused by statin therapy (possibly exacerbated by concurrent azithrom"

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Main barrier to extubation is
   sedation.  s/p bronchoscopy/BAL [**2141-3-11**].
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials
   - too sedated on exam this morning, will defer extubation
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   has continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics,
   and improvement in respiratory status. ID following. CT abd/pelvis and
   CT sinuses were negative by prelim read.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic to hypovolemic.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: No known history of diabetes. Contributing factors
   include stress response to infection, h/o pancreatic resection,
   infusion of meds in D5W.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue basal insulin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Coumadin; trend INR
   - heparin SQ for DVT ppx while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction
   -pacer revison in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient was intubated for hypoxemia and is currently mechanically ventilated. The etiology of respiratory failure is likely pneumonia combined with heart failure. The patient's respiratory status is improving clinically and radiographically. The main barrier to extubation is sedation. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage on [2141-3-11].

The patient continues to have fever, and the source is unclear. Initially, it was attributed to pneumonia, but the patient has continued to spike high fevers despite Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory status. Infection control is being followed, and a CT abdomen/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative by preliminary read.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. The patient is euvolemic to hypovolemic. Fluid status is"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   has continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics,
   and improvement in respiratory status. ID following. CT abd/pelvis and
   CT sinuses were negative by prelim read.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   - TEE to look for ? lead endocarditis
   - if above is negative, will need to consider other causes, such as CNS
   infx or drug fever
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Main barrier to extubation has been
   sedation.
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials
   - wean sedation
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic to hypovolemic.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - lasix boluses for goal I/O negative 1 L
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - increase Coumadin; trend INR
   - starting heparin gtt bridge while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction. Of note, ICD did not
   shock patient during code blue yesterday.
   -pacer revision in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to be experiencing a congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia. However, the source of fever remains unclear as it continues despite antibiotics and improvement in respiratory status. The patient has been intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia and heart failure. There are concerns about lead endocarditis given the patient's history of ICD implantation. The patient's systolic heart failure is being managed with careful fluid balance and diuretics. Elevated CK levels are attributed to a recent stain and are trending down. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and previous anterior wall myocardial infarction. Telemetry shows a ventricular-paced rhythm, and the patient's INR is subtherapeutic. The patient's ICD is not functioning properly, with high impedance and left ventricular lead dysfunction. There are also issues related to hypothyroidism, anemia, and complications from previous Whipple's surgery. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea. He was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia but has continued to spike high fevers despite receiving Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory status. The patient's condition has been complicated by cardiac arrest, hypoxemic respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, elevated creatine kinase levels, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator dysfunction, hypothyroidism, anemia, and a history of Whipple's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and is being investigated for potential intracardiac source of infection, which could indicate infective endocarditis or another type of infection.
2. Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient experienced a ventricular fibrillation during the code blue event, and the ICD did not terminate it. This highlights the risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, which may require external therapy since the ICD is not functioning properly.
3. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's baseline ejection fraction is 20-25%, indicating severe systolic dysfunction. Management of chronic heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   has continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics,
   and improvement in respiratory status. ID following. CT abd/pelvis and
   CT sinuses were negative by prelim read.
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   - TEE to look for ? lead endocarditis
   - if above is negative, will need to consider other causes, such as CNS
   infx or drug fever
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Main barrier to extubation has been
   sedation.
   - continue mechanical ventilation, with daily spontaneous breathing
   trials
   - wean sedation
   - continue meropenem monotherapy
   - f/u pending cultures (no positive micro data to date)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic to hypovolemic.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - lasix boluses for goal I/O negative 1 L
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - increase Coumadin; trend INR
   - starting heparin gtt bridge while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction. Of note, ICD did not
   shock patient during code blue yesterday.
   -pacer revision in future
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white blood count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The etiology of the respiratory failure is likely pneumonia and heart failure. The patient's respiratory status has been improving clinically and radiographically, but sedation remains a barrier to extubation.

The patient's condition is further complicated by several other medical issues. There is an ongoing fever of unknown origin, which has not resolved despite antibiotics and improvement in respiratory status. The source of the fever remains unclear. Imaging studies such as CT abdomen/pelvis and CT sinuses have been negative.

The patient also has elevated cardiac enzymes, suggesting possible myocardial injury or ischemia. However, three sets of cardiac enzymes have ruled out a new myocardial infarction. The patient's ICD is not functioning properly due to high impedance, likely caused by lead dysfunction.

The patient's INR is subtherapeutic,"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement in respiratory status. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   neg. Pt has been afebrile over 24 hours at this point. However, he did
   have a positive blood cx (GPC
s) this am. This could represent true
   infection versus contaminant.
   - continue meropenem; adding vanc in the setting of positive blood cx
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   - TEE to look for ? lead endocarditis
   - will need to pull CVL in setting of positive blood cx; d/w team
   whether we should place another CVL versus try to obtain peripheral
   access until patient is able to get a PICC
   - if above is negative and pt continues to spike fevers, will need to
   consider other causes, such as CNS infx or drug fever
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Mental status greatly improved this
   morning; RSBI in the 30
   - attempt extubation after TEE
   - f/u pending cultures
   - f/u bronch data
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - lasix boluses for goal I/O negative 1 L; will give 60 mg IV lasix now
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently near therapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - increase Coumadin; trend INR
   - starting heparin gtt bridge while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction. Of note, ICD did not
   shock patient during code blue yesterday.
   -pacer revision in future
   -TEE to look for lead endocarditis, as above
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia. However, the patient continued to spike high fevers despite antibiotics and improvement in respiratory status. A CT abdomen/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. The patient has been afebrile for 24 hours and has a positive blood culture (GPC positive) this morning. This could represent true infection or contaminant.

The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure improved clinically and radiographically, leading to intubation on [**3-4**]. The etiology is likely pneumonia and heart failure. The patient's mental status greatly improved this morning, and the RSBI is in the 30s. It is planned to attempt extubation after transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and to follow pending cultures and bronchoscopic data.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He has been diuresing well to lasix boluses. It is planned to continue monitoring fluid status, continue metoprolol, and give 60 mg IV lasix now.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient continues to spike high fevers despite Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory status. Imaging studies such as CT abdomen/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. The patient's ICD did not shock during code blue yesterday.

The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia and heart failure. Respiratory status is improving clinically and radiographically. The main barrier to extubation has been sedation.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Fluid status is euvolemic to hypovolemic. The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is elevated but trending down, likely caused by statin therapy. The CK level is not at a significant enough level to cause renal failure.

The patient has a history of anterior wall myocardial infarction in [**2126**]. The patient reported some chest pressure previously, but this has since resolved. Myocardial infarction has been ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is on warfarin. His international normalized ratio (INR) is currently subtherapeutic. Telemetry currently shows ventricular-paced rhythm.

The patient underwent Whipple procedure and is on tube feeds. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation is being held while on tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fever: The patient continues to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory status. The source of the fever is unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, which may include pneumonia, lead endocarditis, central nervous system infection, or drug fever.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Although the patient's respiratory status is improving, there is a risk of further deterioration. Daily spontaneous breathing trials should be continued to assess readiness for extubation.

3. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Fluid status is euvolemic to hypovolemic. Close monitoring of fluid status and medication adjustment, including metoprolol and lasix, should be continued.

4. Elevated CK: The patient's CK level is elevated but trending down"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 106/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid volume.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,514 mL and output of 2,132 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -618 mL. This indicates potential fluid overload or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, indicating an inflammatory response or infection. The platelet count is slightly low, with a value of 343,000/mm3. The creatinine level is within normal range at 1.0 mg/dL, while the blood glucose level is elevated at 196 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including meropenem for infection, heparin for anticoagulation, and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient also has arterial and multi-lumen central venous catheters in place.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement in respiratory status. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   neg. Pt has been afebrile over 24 hours at this point. However, he did
   have a positive blood cx (GPC
s) this am. This could represent true
   infection versus contaminant.
   - continue meropenem; adding vanc in the setting of positive blood cx
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   - TEE to look for ? lead endocarditis
   - will need to pull CVL in setting of positive blood cx; d/w team
   whether we should place another CVL versus try to obtain peripheral
   access until patient is able to get a PICC
   - if above is negative and pt continues to spike fevers, will need to
   consider other causes, such as CNS infx or drug fever
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Mental status greatly improved this
   morning; RSBI in the 30
   - attempt extubation after TEE
   - f/u pending cultures
   - f/u bronch data
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - lasix boluses for goal I/O negative 1 L; will give 60 mg IV lasix now
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently near therapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - increase Coumadin; trend INR
   - starting heparin gtt bridge while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction. Of note, ICD did not
   shock patient during code blue yesterday.
   -pacer revision in future
   -TEE to look for lead endocarditis, as above
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in 2006, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
- The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.
- The patient was intubated on [date] for hypoxemia and the etiology of respiratory failure was likely pneumonia plus heart failure. The patient's respiratory status improved clinically and radiographically.
- The patient's mental status greatly improved this morning. The patient's RSBI (respiratory system resistance index) is in the 30s.
- The patient underwent extubation after a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).
- The patient has been diuresing well to lasix boluses.
- The patient has an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level, which is likely caused by statin therapy (possibly exacerbated by concurrent azithromycin therapy). The CK level is trending down.
- The patient has a history of an anterior wall"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile x 48 hours. Previously, patient was
   spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement
   of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection or
   non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx
   (coag neg staph). This could represent true infection versus
   contaminant.
   - continue meropenem/vanc
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Now s/p extubation. Was intubated on
   [**4-20**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia
   + heart failure.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - treat pneumonia as above
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - lasix boluses for goal I/O negative 1 L
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently near therapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction. Of note, ICD did not
   shock patient during VT/VF arrest.
   -f/u EP recs
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation if patient is cleared by speech and
   swallow.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Pulled NG tube yesterday. Will under repeat speech and
   swallow evaluation tomorrow, as mental status is rapidly improving.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), myocardial infarction in [**26**], paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, history of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

2. The patient was intubated on [**4-20**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia and heart failure. He was extubated at 4 PM.

3. The patient had a positive blood culture for coag-negative Staphylococcus, which could represent a true infection or contaminant. He is being treated with meropenem and vancomycin.

4. The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He has been diuresing well to Lasix boluses. His fluid status is being closely monitored.

5. The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, which are trending down. This is likely caused by statin therapy. The statin has been held.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

- The patient was intubated on [4-20] for hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia and heart failure. His blood cultures showed one positive result for coag-negative Staphylococcus.

- The patient's condition improved, and he was extubated. However, he continues to have fevers, which may be due to an occult infection or non-infectious cause. Further investigations are pending.

- The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He has been diuresing well with Lasix boluses.

- The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels are likely caused by statin therapy, possibly exacerbated by concurrent azithromycin therapy. The CK levels are trending down.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Fever: Source unclear. Initially attributed to pneumonia, but patient
   continued to spike high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement in respiratory status. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   neg. Pt has been afebrile over 24 hours at this point. However, he did
   have a positive blood cx (GPC
s) this am. This could represent true
   infection versus contaminant.
   - continue meropenem; adding vanc in the setting of positive blood cx
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   - TEE to look for ? lead endocarditis
   - will need to pull CVL in setting of positive blood cx; d/w team
   whether we should place another CVL versus try to obtain peripheral
   access until patient is able to get a PICC
   - if above is negative and pt continues to spike fevers, will need to
   consider other causes, such as CNS infx or drug fever
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Was intubated on [**3-4**] for hypoxemia.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Respiratory status improving
   clinically and radiographically. Mental status greatly improved this
   morning; RSBI in the 30
   - attempt extubation after TEE
   - f/u pending cultures
   - f/u bronch data
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - lasix boluses for goal I/O negative 1 L; will give 60 mg IV lasix now
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - continue to trend CK
   - no further IV fluids at this point, as CK not at a significant enough
   level to cause renal failure
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently near therapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - increase Coumadin; trend INR
   - starting heparin gtt bridge while subtherapeutic INR
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction. Of note, ICD did not
   shock patient during code blue yesterday.
   -pacer revision in future
   -TEE to look for lead endocarditis, as above
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation while on tube feeds.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in 2006, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

The patient was intubated on 3/4 for hypoxemia, likely secondary to pneumonia and heart failure. His respiratory status has improved clinically and radiographically. Mental status has also greatly improved this morning, and he is now extubated. His fever has resolved, and blood cultures are pending. Bronchoscopic data is also pending.

The patient continues to have chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He has been diuresing well to lasix boluses. His CK level is elevated but trending down and is likely caused by statin therapy. The patient has a history of an anterior wall myocardial infarction in 2006 and is on aspirin, simvastatin, and metoprolol.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin with an INR near therapeutic range. Te"

   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # s/p VT/VF arrest/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**]
   during which ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external
   therapy.  High impedance. LV lead dysfunction.
   - f/u EP recs
   - [**Hospital1 1896**] pads in place
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Now s/p extubation and satting well on
   room air. Was intubated on [**4-20**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - treat pneumonia as above and heart failure as below
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile x 72 hours. Previously, patient was
   spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement
   of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection or
   non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx
   (coag neg staph). This could represent true infection versus
   contaminant.
   - continue meropenem for now. Will change to cefpodoxime once patient
   can take PO
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses. Had very strong diuresis overnight to
   Lasix 60 mg IV. Can be more gentle with diuresis in future.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - goal negative 2.5 L today (already negative 2.5 L)

   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with pneumonia. Fever, white blood cell count, and infiltrate on chest X-ray were consistent with pneumonia.
- The patient had a ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest on [3-12] during which the implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy. High impedance and left ventricular lead dysfunction were noted.
- The patient was intubated on [4-20] for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is now extubated and oxygenating well on room air. The etiology of the respiratory failure is likely pneumonia and heart failure.
- The patient had high fevers despite antibiotics and improvement of pneumonia, leading to concerns about an occult infection or non-infectious cause of fever. A computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed no vegetation. A positive blood culture for coag-negative Staphylococcus was noted.
- The patient has a history"

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA.
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile x 48 hours. Previously, patient was
   spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement
   of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection or
   non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx
   (coag neg staph). This could represent true infection versus
   contaminant.
   - continue meropenem/vanc
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Now s/p extubation. Was intubated on
   [**4-20**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia
   + heart failure.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - treat pneumonia as above
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - lasix boluses for goal I/O negative 1 L
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by stain (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin. His INR is currently near therapeutic. Telemetry currently
   showing v-paced rhythm.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # s/p ICD: high impedance. LV lead dysfunction. Of note, ICD did not
   shock patient during VT/VF arrest.
   -f/u EP recs
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation if patient is cleared by speech and
   swallow.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Pulled NG tube yesterday. Will under repeat speech and
   swallow evaluation tomorrow, as mental status is rapidly improving.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), myocardial infarction in '[**26**]', paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, history of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), presenting with dyspnea and suspected pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, chronic systolic heart failure, elevated CK (possibly due to statin therapy), coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, LV lead dysfunction of ICD, hypothyroidism, anemia, and post-Whipple procedure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the progress note include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with fever and infiltrate on chest X-ray, which improved with antibiotics. However, the patient had spiking high fevers despite treatment, raising concerns about an occult infection or non-infectious cause of fever. Therefore, there is a potential for recurrence or worsening of pneumonia.

2. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 20-25%. If not properly managed, this condition can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function, exacerbation of heart failure symptoms, and potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.

3. Elevated CK:"

","Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, history of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.
- The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.
- The patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest on [**3-12**] during which the ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy. High impedance. LV lead dysfunction.
- The patient was intubated on [**4-20**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
- The patient had fever and pneumonia, now afebrile for 72 hours. Previously, the patient was spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection or non-infectious cause of fever. CT abdomen/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. Transesophageal echocardi"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -ID recs: stop vanc and meropenem; restart cefpodoxime; no objection to
   PICC removal or device replacement during this admission from ID
   perspective
   -EP recs: Device interrogated with [**Company 1994**] representative. RV coil
   fractured, leading to high impedence and inability to defibrillate.
   Since SVC coil impedence is calculated using RV coil, this appears
   elevated. LV coil is unipolar, with impedence calculated to RV coil,
   making is also appear elevated. A lead impedence is elevated, but still
   functional and may be due to scar or tissue impedence problem. [**Name (NI) 133**]
   discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5152**] re: extraction vs. new lead. Keep
   defibrillator at bedside. Increase amiodarone to 400 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for VT. If
   VT continues, consider ablation next week.
   -increased amiodarone to 400 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -looked into history of lead infection. Per [**Hospital **] clinic notes, TEE on
   [**2139-8-20**] showed mobile echodensities on both pacer leads
   -had runs of VT lasting as long as 30 seconds. Gave amiodarone 150 mg
   IV, followed by 1 mg/min for 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/min for 18 hours
   -changed meropenem to cefpodoxime
   -will need to be NPO after midnight on Sunday for possible EP procedure
   -4:30 a.m. Had 30 seconds of VT with HR 200. Unclear if patient had
   pulse. [**Name8 (MD) 54**] RN, patient was exhibiting agonal breathing, so he was
   defibrillated. Following defibrillation, patient received approximately
   1 minute of CPR.

   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile for several days. Previously, patient
   was spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection
   or non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, post implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ICD Dysfunction: The patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest during which the ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy. There have been multiple runs of VT, including a second VT arrest last night requiring defibrillation. The etiology of the recently increased ectopy is unclear.

2. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The etiology likely includes pneumonia and heart failure. Prior to the last night's VT arrest, the patient was saturating well on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC). He has had increased O2 requirement since, possibly related to aspiration or worsening heart failure.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is disoriented, experiencing waxing and waning consciousness, and has a reversal of sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several health issues. The patient has a fever of 101.8°F and agitation, with vital signs otherwise stable. The patient has been given meropenem for possible aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia, and a chest X-ray has been ordered for the morning rounds.

The patient's creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels have increased, causing diuresis. Amiodarone has been decreased, and metoprolol has been increased per electrophysiology (EP) recommendations. The patient's ventricular tachycardia (VT) could have been terminated by ATP, and the pacer rate has been set between 75-100 beats per minute to avoid fast-slow-fast sequences that may have precipitated VT. ATP has also been added in a fibrillation ventricular (FVT) zone of 260-300 and a dual fibrillation ventricular (DVT) zone of 300-400.

The patient has been advised to remain NPO (nothing by mouth) except for medications, with aspiration precautions. Blood and sputum cultures have been sent, and allergies to penicillins and Ambien have been noted.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 03/15/2141 at 08:00 PM, followed by meropenem on 03/17/2141 at 10:00 PM. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure. The patient had been afebrile all day but experienced a sudden spike in temperature to 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit at around 10 PM. Vital signs were otherwise stable, although the patient appeared agitated. He was pan-cultured, given a one-time dose of meropenem for suspected aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia, and a chest X-ray was ordered for morning rounds.

The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels increased, leading to maxed diuresis. Amiodarone was decreased, and metoprolol was increased per EP recommendations. The patient's ventricular tachycardia could have been terminated by ATP, so the pacer was set at a higher rate of 75-100 beats per minute to avoid fast-slow-fast sequences. ATP was also added in a FVT zone of 260-300 and DVT zone of 300-400.

The patient was advised to remain NPO except for medications and follow aspiration precautions. Blood and sputum cultures were sent. The patient has allergies to penicillins, hives, rash, and Ambien. His last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 03/15/2141 at 08:00 PM, and meropenem on 03"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, infarct-related cardiomyopathy, and previous ventricular tachycardia (VT) treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was found to have pneumonia with a chest infiltrate, fever, and leukocytosis. He was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He experienced episodes of pulseless VT requiring defibrillation and CPR. His ICD dysfunctioned during the VT/VF arrest, and he required external therapy. The patient is currently delirious, hypoxic, and febrile, with a recent spike in temperature. His renal function is worsening, and he has an elevated creatinine and BUN. His potassium levels are also elevated. He is on multiple medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, lasix, and heparin. The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by several issues, including VT/VF arrest, hypoxia, delirium, pneumonia, and worsening renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of VT, which has recently recurred, requiring defibrillation and CPR. The cause of the VT is unclear. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia. The patient had a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest during which the ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy. He also had multiple runs of VT, including a second VT arrest last night requiring defibrillation. The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. He developed a fever, which is now controlled with antibiotics. The patient's mental status has been altered since intubation, and he has been diagnosed with delirium. His heart failure has been managed with diuretics, and he has been on a ventilator due to hypoxia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced multiple episodes of VT, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation with fever, white count, and infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of complications.
3. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, and his condition may"

- The patient has a history of systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in [**26**], paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o VT/VF s/p ICD implantation.
- The patient's ICD dysfunction includes LV lead not pacing, RV lead pacing, and a sensed V paced.
- The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia and heart failure, possibly related to aspiration.
- The patient's altered mental status is likely due to recent intubation and ICU environment.
- The patient's fever/pneumonia has been improving, but there are concerns about an occult infection or non-infect"

   due to pacer setting.
   .
   # s/p VT/VF arrest/ICD dysfunction: LV lead not pacing, only RV
   ([**3-4**]).  PMR programmed to DDD
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Patient had
   multiple runs of VT, including second VT arrest 2 nites ago requiring
   defibrillation.  Etiology of recently increased ectopy thought [**1-24**]
   fast/short sequences, pacer settings. A sensed V paced.
   .  Device may not be able to detect VT/VF.  Pt will have to be
   Externally defibrillated
   -Unlikely to need ablation as previously thought when etiology VT
   unclear.
   -continue current amnio dose 200mg daily,  metoprololl 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   Possible lead extraction next week for RV coil fracture.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to VT arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC . Has had increased O2
   requirement since, requiring face mask and desating when not on it,
   possibly related to aspiration, less likely worsening heart failure.
   Spiked temp last night, most likely asp pneumonitis, mild leukocytosis.
    Heart failure lesser contributor, diuresed well to 20 IV lasix but no
   frther given, given bump in Cr. Not grossly volume overloaded on exam.
   Given prior hx, broadened to meropenem but can consider narrowing if
   remains afebrile, pending Cx data
   -aspiration precautions
   -allow to autodiurese today, if later in day appears positive, consider
   lasix bolus,
   -f/u speech and swallow recs
   -diurese for goal negative 1 L today
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has intermittent periods of lucidity, over
   general course slightl improved.  MS currently limiting ability to take
   p.o . Plan currently to keep NPO except meds, repeat swallow eval early
   next week.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   Acute renal failure: hypernatremia, Cr increased y/d in setting lasix
   IV. [**Month (only) 51**] need to give free H20 to correct free h20 deficit today. Cr
   increased to 1.3 yesterday. Now 1.1
   Continue to trend Cr
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile for several days. Previously, patient
   was spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection
   or non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx
   (coag neg staph). This could represent true infection versus
   contaminant.
   - f/u culture data with plan to narrow vs provide HAP with aspiration
   coverage.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   -
   # Coagulopathy: INR markedly elevated y/d. Likely related to
   amiodarone.
   -continue to hold Coumadin until below 2.0 then restart.
   -continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate. The patient also had a fever and white blood cell count consistent with pneumonia initially on meropenem for concern of resistant Klebsiella. However, the patient was later found to be culture-negative, and the antibiotic regimen was narrowed to suppressive cefpodoxime. The patient's temperature spiked again, and meropenem was restarted.

The patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia arrest on [Date] due to pacing settings. He required external therapy for ventricular fibrillation two nights ago. The etiology of the recent ectopy is thought to be fast/short sequences, and the pacing settings were adjusted accordingly. The patient's ICD may not be able to detect ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. If the patient develops ventricular tachycardia, he will need external therapy as the ICD is not functioning properly. Possible lead extraction next week for RV coil fracture was mentioned.

The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia and heart failure. Prior to the ventricular arrest"

   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation with
   infiltrate, fever, white count consistent with PNA initially on
   meropenem for concern resistant klebsiella who has been cx negative,
   narrowed to suppressive cefpodoxime regimen now spiking temp with
   meropenem restarted. Pt also had VT thought [**1-24**] fast/short sequences
   due to pacer setting.
   .
   # s/p VT/VF arrest/ICD dysfunction: LV lead not pacing, only RV
   ([**3-4**]).  PMR programmed to DDD
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Patient had
   multiple runs of VT, including second VT arrest 2 nites ago requiring
   defibrillation.  Etiology of recently increased ectopy thought [**1-24**]
   fast/short sequences, pacer settings. A sensed V paced.
   .  Device may not be able to detect VT/VF.  Pt will have to be
   Externally defibrillated
   -Unlikely to need ablation as previously thought when etiology VT
   unclear.
   -continue current amnio dose 200mg daily,  metoprololl 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   Possible lead extraction next week for RV coil fracture.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to VT arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC . Has had increased O2
   requirement since, requiring face mask and desating when not on it,
   possibly related to aspiration, less likely worsening heart failure.
   Spiked temp last night, most likely asp pneumonitis, mild
   leukocytosis.  Heart failure lesser contributor, diuresed well to 20 IV
   lasix but no frther given, given bump in Cr. Not grossly volume
   overloaded on exam.
   Given prior hx, broadened to meropenem but can consider narrowing if
   remains afebrile, pending Cx data
   -aspiration precautions
   -allow to autodiurese today, if later in day appears positive, consider
   lasix bolus,
   -f/u speech and swallow recs
   -diurese for goal negative 1 L today
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has intermittent periods of lucidity, over
   general course slightl improved.  MS currently limiting ability to take
   p.o . Plan currently to keep NPO except meds, repeat swallow eval early
   next week.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   Acute renal failure: hypernatremia, Cr increased y/d in setting lasix
   IV. [**Month (only) 51**] need to give free H20 to correct free h20 deficit today. Cr
   increased to 1.3 yesterday. Now 1.1
   Continue to trend Cr
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile for several days. Previously, patient
   was spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection
   or non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx
   (coag neg staph). This could represent true infection versus
   contaminant.
   - f/u culture data with plan to narrow vs provide HAP with aspiration
   coverage.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies

   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   -
   # Coagulopathy: INR markedly elevated y/d. Likely related to
   amiodarone.
   -continue to hold Coumadin until below 2.0 then restart.
   -continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history including systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation with infiltrate, fever, and white count consistent with pneumonia. He was started on meropenem for concern of resistant Klebsiella, but the culture was negative. The patient also had a ventricular tachycardia arrest, which required external therapy. He is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has had intermittent periods of lucidity and is suspected to have delirium. His mental status has improved with orientation to person and place. He has been diuresing well with furosemide, showing improvement in the chest X-ray and oxygenation. The patient's fever resolved, but recently spiked again, leading to the restart of meropenem. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, including fever, white count elevation, and infiltrate on chest X-ray. Although the initial culture was negative, the patient's recent fever spike could indicate a possible recurrence or another infectious process.
2. Ventricular Tachycard"

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   .
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil
   fractured.
   -f/u EP recs regarding need for EP procedure/ICD revision
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to second arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC. Had increased O2
   requirement after arrest, thought to be related to aspiration
   pneumonitis, but now satting well on 2L NC. Heart failure less likely
   etiology of hypoxia.
   -aspiration precautions
   -f/u speech and swallow recs
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -restart home dose of PO Lasix
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had marked improvement in past 2 days.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile. Previously, patient was spiking high
   fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement of pneumonia.
   This led to concern about an occult infection or non-infectious cause
   of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. TEE showed no
   vegetation. There was one positive blood cx (coag neg staph), thought
   to be a contaminant.  Patient was afebrile from [**Date range (1) 14227**], but spiked
   one fever to 101.8 thought to be related to possible aspiration
   pneumonitis in setting of recent arrest. Has been afebrile since.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   - no abx for now except chronic suppressive cefpodoxime therapy for
   history of device infection
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - restart PO Lasix at home dose
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to altered mental status/inability to take
   adequate PO.
   - replete free water deficit D5W (and orally if patient can take PO)
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient starts to eat.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Patient more alert today. Will allow patient to consume
   dysphagia diet with close supervision and plan to formal speech and
   swallow evaluation on Monday.

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers in spite of
   Tylenol and meropenem, runs of VT, and ICD malfunction.  , narrowed to
   suppressive cefpodoxime regimen now spiking temp with meropenem
   restarted. Pt also had VT thought [**1-24**] fast/short sequences due to pacer
   setting.
   .
   # s/p VT/VF arrest/ICD dysfunction: LV lead not pacing, only RV
   ([**3-4**]).  PMR programmed to DDD
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Patient had
   multiple runs of VT, including second VT arrest 2 nites ago requiring
   defibrillation.  Etiology of recently increased ectopy thought [**1-24**]
   fast/short sequences, pacer settings. A sensed V paced.
   .  Device may not be able to detect VT/VF.  Pt will have to be
   Externally defibrillated
   -Unlikely to need ablation as previously thought when etiology VT
   unclear.
   -continue current amnio dose 200mg daily,  metoprololl 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   Possible lead extraction next week for RV coil fracture.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to VT arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC . Has had increased O2
   requirement since, requiring face mask and desating when not on it,
   possibly related to aspiration, less likely worsening heart failure.
   Spiked temp last night, most likely asp pneumonitis, mild
   leukocytosis.  Heart failure lesser contributor, diuresed well to 20 IV
   lasix but no frther given, given bump in Cr. Not grossly volume
   overloaded on exam.
   Given prior hx, broadened to meropenem but can consider narrowing if
   remains afebrile, pending Cx data
   -aspiration precautions
   -allow to autodiurese today, if later in day appears positive, consider
   lasix bolus,
   -f/u speech and swallow recs
   -diurese for goal negative 1 L today
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has intermittent periods of lucidity, over
   general course slightl improved.  MS currently limiting ability to take
   p.o . Plan currently to keep NPO except meds, repeat swallow eval early
   next week.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Acute renal failure: hypernatremia, Cr increased y/d in setting lasix
   IV. [**Month (only) 51**] need to give free H20 to correct free h20 deficit today. Cr
   increased to 1.3 yesterday. Now 1.1
   Continue to trend Cr
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile for several days. Previously, patient
   was spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection
   or non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx
   (coag neg staph). This could represent true infection versus
   contaminant.
   - f/u culture data with plan to narrow vs provide HAP with aspiration
   coverage.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   -
   # Coagulopathy: INR markedly elevated y/d. Likely related to
   amiodarone.
   -continue to hold Coumadin until below 2.0 then restart.
   -continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers in spite of Tylenol and meropenem, runs of VT, and ICD malfunction. 

The patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest on [3-12] during which the ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy. The patient also had multiple runs of VT, including a second VT arrest two nights ago requiring defibrillation. The etiology of the recently increased ectopy was thought to be fast/short sequences due to pacer settings. A sensed V paced.

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including pneumonia, acute renal failure (hypernatremia, Cr increased), fever, hypoxia, altered mental status, and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient's ICD may not be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, reintubation, and runs of VT including one VT arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VT/VF/ICD Dysfunction: The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrests and required external therapy due to ICD malfunction. There are plans to follow up with electrophysiology recommendations regarding the need for an electrophysiology procedure and ICD revision.
2. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia and heart failure. After the second arrest, the patient's oxygen requirement increased, but now he is tolerating 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen well, making heart failure less likely as the etiology of hypoxia.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has shown signs of disorientation, waxing and waning alertness, and reversal of sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. The etiology is"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers in spite of
   Tylenol and meropenem, runs of VT, ICD malfunction, VT/VF arrest
   requiring debrillation and reintubation, and rapid VT requiring
   defibrillation, narrowed to suppressive cefpodoxime regimen now spiking
   temp with meropenem restarted. Pt also had VT thought [**1-24**] fast/short
   sequences due to pacer setting.
   .
   # s/p VT/VF arrest/ICD dysfunction: LV lead not pacing, only RV
   ([**3-4**]).  PMR programmed to DDD
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Patient had
   multiple runs of VT, including second VT arrest 2 nites ago requiring
   defibrillation.  Etiology of recently increased ectopy thought [**1-24**]
   fast/short sequences, pacer settings. A sensed V paced.
   .  Device may not be able to detect VT/VF.  Pt will have to be
   Externally defibrillated
   -Unlikely to need ablation as previously thought when etiology VT
   unclear.
   -continue current amnio dose 200mg daily,  metoprololl 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   Possible lead extraction next week for RV coil fracture.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to VT arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC . Has had increased O2
   requirement since, requiring face mask and desating when not on it,
   possibly related to aspiration, less likely worsening heart failure.
   Spiked temp last night, most likely asp pneumonitis, mild
   leukocytosis.  Heart failure lesser contributor, diuresed well to 20 IV
   lasix but no frther given, given bump in Cr. Not grossly volume
   overloaded on exam.
   Given prior hx, broadened to meropenem but can consider narrowing if
   remains afebrile, pending Cx data
   -aspiration precautions
   -allow to autodiurese today, if later in day appears positive, consider
   lasix bolus,
   -f/u speech and swallow recs
   -diurese for goal negative 1 L today
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has intermittent periods of lucidity, over
   general course slightl improved.  MS currently limiting ability to take
   p.o . Plan currently to keep NPO except meds, repeat swallow eval early
   next week.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Acute renal failure: hypernatremia, Cr increased y/d in setting lasix
   IV. [**Month (only) 51**] need to give free H20 to correct free h20 deficit today. Cr
   increased to 1.3 yesterday. Now 1.1
   Continue to trend Cr
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile for several days. Previously, patient
   was spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection
   or non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx
   (coag neg staph). This could represent true infection versus
   contaminant.
   - f/u culture data with plan to narrow vs provide HAP with aspiration
   coverage.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   -
   # Coagulopathy: INR markedly elevated y/d. Likely related to
   amiodarone.
   -continue to hold Coumadin until below 2.0 then restart.
   -continue to trend.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation if patient is cleared by speech and

   .
   # s/p VT/VF arrest/ICD dysfunction: LV lead not pacing, only RV
   ([**3-4**]).  PMR programmed to DDD
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Patient had
   multiple runs of VT, including second VT arrest 2 nites ago requiring
   defibrillation.  Etiology of recently increased ectopy thought [**1-24**]
   fast/short sequences, pacer settings. A sensed V paced.
   .  Device may not be able to detect VT/VF.  Pt will have to be
   Externally defibrillated
   -Unlikely to need ablation as previously thought when etiology VT
   unclear.
   -continue current amnio dose 200mg daily,  metoprololl 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   Possible lead extraction next week for RV coil fracture.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to VT arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC . Has had increased O2
   requirement since, requiring face mask and desating when not on it,
   possibly related to aspiration, less likely worsening heart failure.
   Spiked temp last night, most likely asp pneumonitis, mild
   leukocytosis.  Heart failure lesser contributor, diuresed well to 20 IV
   lasix but no frther given, given bump in Cr. Not grossly volume
   overloaded on exam.
   Given prior hx, broadened to meropenem but can consider narrowing if
   remains afebrile, pending Cx data

   -diurese for goal negative 1 L today
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has intermittent periods of lucidity, over
   general course slightl improved.  MS currently limiting ability to take
   p.o . Plan currently to keep NPO except meds, repeat swallow eval early
   next week.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Acute renal failure: hypernatremia, Cr increased y/d in setting lasix
   IV. [**Month (only) 51**] need to give free H20 to correct free h20 deficit today. Cr
   increased to 1.3 yesterday. Now 1.1
   Continue to trend Cr
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile for several days. Previously, patient
   was spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and
   improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern about an occult infection
   or non-infectious cause of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were
   negative. TEE showed no vegetation. There was one positive blood cx
   (coag neg staph). This could represent true infection versus
   contaminant.
   - f/u culture data with plan to narrow vs provide HAP with aspiration
   coverage.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Has been
   diuresing well to lasix boluses.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   -
   # Coagulopathy: INR markedly elevated y/d. Likely related to
   amiodarone.
   -continue to hold Coumadin until below 2.0 then restart.
   -continue to trend.

   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin

   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   .
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil
   fractured.
   -f/u EP recs regarding need for EP procedure/ICD revision
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to second arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC. Had increased O2
   requirement after arrest, thought to be related to aspiration
   pneumonitis, but now satting well on 2L NC. Heart failure less likely
   etiology of hypoxia.
   -aspiration precautions
   -f/u speech and swallow recs
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -restart home dose of PO Lasix
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had marked improvement in past 2 days.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile. Previously, patient was spiking high
   fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement of pneumonia.
   This led to concern about an occult infection or non-infectious cause
   of fever. CT abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. TEE showed no
   vegetation. There was one positive blood cx (coag neg staph), thought
   to be a contaminant.  Patient was afebrile from [**Date range (1) 14227**], but spiked
   one fever to 101.8 thought to be related to possible aspiration
   pneumonitis in setting of recent arrest. Has been afebrile since.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies
   - no abx for now except chronic suppressive cefpodoxime therapy for
   history of device infection

   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - restart PO Lasix at home dose
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to altered mental status/inability to take
   adequate PO.
   - replete free water deficit D5W (and orally if patient can take PO)
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient starts to eat.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in '[**26**]', paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation secondary to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of an infiltrate, fever, and white blood cell count. 

During the hospital course, the patient experienced several complications including high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one arrest that required external defibrillation. The etiology of recent increased ectopy is thought to be fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in the setting of amiodarone. The right ventricular coil fractured.

The patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia plus heart failure. Prior to the second arrest, the patient was saturating well on 2 liters nasal cannula. Increased O2 requirement after arrest was thought to be related to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, for which he has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one arrest which required external defibrillation. The patient has also had an altered mental status characterized by disorientation, waxing and waning attention, reversal of sleep/wake cycle, and no focal neurologic deficits. The patient's condition has improved over the past two days.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which can be life-threatening and require immediate defibrillation.

2. Delirium/confusion: The patient exhibits symptoms of delirium, including disorientation, waxing and"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   .
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday pending patient and
   family are in agreement
   -f/u EP recs regarding need for EP procedure/ICD revision
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to second arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC. Had increased O2
   requirement after arrest, thought to be related to aspiration
   pneumonitis, but now satting well on 2L NC. This is still above
   baseline as he does not usually use supplemental oxygen.  Heart failure
   less likely etiology of hypoxia and received home dose PO lasix this
   am.  Speech and swallow evaluated this am and recommend PNO for now
   except meds with repeat video swallow study.
   -aspiration precautions
   -Video swallow study
   - F/u speech and swallow recs based on results of video, but for now
   NPO except meds
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue home dose of PO Lasix
   -check PM Is/Os
 if not 1 to 1.5 L negative will give one dose IV 40
   mg lasix as yesterday pt required extra IV dose
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had overall marked improvement in past 2
   days.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile status post completed course of
   antibiotics. Previously, patient was spiking high fevers in spite of
   Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern
   about an occult infection or non-infectious cause of fever. CT
   abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. TEE showed no vegetation.
   There was one positive blood cx (coag neg staph), thought to be a
   contaminant.  Patient was afebrile from [**Date range (1) 14227**], but spiked one fever
   to 101.8 thought to be related to possible aspiration pneumonitis in
   setting of recent arrest. Has been afebrile since.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies which currently show no growth.
   Urine cultuire [**3-17**] negative
   - no abx for now except chronic suppressive cefpodoxime therapy for
   history of device infection
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose
   - will check Is/Os and if not 1-1.5 L negative will give extra 40 mg IV
   lasix
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to altered mental status/inability to take
   adequate PO.
   - patient was given free water with D5W last night and sodium slightly
   improved, however pt more volume up
   - will consider giving free water if pm labs show worsening
   hypernatremia (and orally if patient can take PO)
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   - recheck Ck
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, this monring there was concern for aspiration so
   speech and swallow consulted
   - video swallow this afternoon
   - NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient starts to eat.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   .
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday pending patient and
   family are in agreement
   -f/u EP recs regarding need for EP procedure/ICD revision
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to second arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC. Had increased O2
   requirement after arrest, thought to be related to aspiration
   pneumonitis, but now satting well on 2L NC. This is still above
   baseline as he does not usually use supplemental oxygen.  Heart failure
   less likely etiology of hypoxia and received home dose PO lasix this
   am.  Speech and swallow evaluated this am and recommend PNO for now
   except meds with repeat video swallow study.
   -aspiration precautions
   -Video swallow study
   - F/u speech and swallow recs based on results of video, but for now
   NPO except meds
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue home dose of PO Lasix
   -check PM Is/Os
 if not 1 to 1.5 L negative will give one dose IV 40
   mg lasix as yesterday pt required extra IV dose
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had overall marked improvement in past 2
   days.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile status post completed course of
   antibiotics. Previously, patient was spiking high fevers in spite of
   Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern
   about an occult infection or non-infectious cause of fever. CT
   abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. TEE showed no vegetation.
   There was one positive blood cx (coag neg staph), thought to be a
   contaminant.  Patient was afebrile from [**Date range (1) 14227**], but spiked one fever
   to 101.8 thought to be related to possible aspiration pneumonitis in
   setting of recent arrest. Has been afebrile since.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies which currently show no growth.
   Urine cultuire [**3-17**] negative
   - no abx for now except chronic suppressive cefpodoxime therapy for
   history of device infection
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose
   - will check Is/Os and if not 1-1.5 L negative will give extra 40 mg IV
   lasix
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to altered mental status/inability to take
   adequate PO.
   - patient was given free water with D5W last night and sodium slightly
   improved, however pt more volume up
   - will consider giving free water if pm labs show worsening
   hypernatremia (and orally if patient can take PO)
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   - recheck Ck
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: On tube feeds.
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient starts to eat.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in 2006, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, for which he has undergone implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white blood count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one ventricular tachycardia arrest. 

The patient has also had altered mental status with disorientation, waxing and waning alertness, and reversal of sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent intubation (with sedating medications) and ICU environment. No focal neurologic deficits. The patient has had marked improvement in the past two days.

Additionally, the patient has had fever/pneumonia, now afebrile status post completed course of antibiotics. Previously, the patient was spiking high fevers in spite of Tylenol, antibiotics, and"

   antibiotics. Previously, patient was spiking high fevers in spite of
   Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern
   about an occult infection or non-infectious cause of fever. CT
   abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. TEE showed no vegetation.
   There was one positive blood cx (coag neg staph), thought to be a
   contaminant.  Patient was afebrile from [**Date range (1) 14227**], but spiked one fever
   to 101.8 thought to be related to possible aspiration pneumonitis in
   setting of recent arrest. Has been afebrile since.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies which currently show no growth.
   Urine cultuire [**3-17**] negative
   - no abx for now except chronic suppressive cefpodoxime therapy for
   history of device infection
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose
   - will check Is/Os and if not 1-1.5 L negative will give extra 40 mg IV
   lasix
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to altered mental status/inability to take
   adequate PO.
   - patient was given free water with D5W last night and sodium slightly
   improved, however pt more volume up
   - will consider giving free water if pm labs show worsening
   hypernatremia (and orally if patient can take PO)
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK trending down.
   - holding statin
   - recheck Ck
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, this monring there was concern for aspiration so
   speech and swallow consulted
   - video swallow this afternoon
   - NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient starts to eat.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), myocardial infarction in '[**26**]', paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to be experiencing a congestive heart failure exacerbation but was later attributed to pneumonia. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, and runs of ventricular tachycardia. The patient also had a fractured right ventricular coil.

Assessment and Plan:
1. VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: The patient had a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest during which the ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy. Subsequently, the patient has experienced multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one arrest requiring external defibrillation. The etiology of recent increased ectopy is thought to be fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in the setting of amiodarone. A tentative plan for ICD revision on Thursday is pending patient and family agreement. The patient will continue on amiodarone 200"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and is currently without an ICD backup. He is in the ICU for further management. The patient's recent events include two ventricular tachycardia arrests and a failed video swallow, resulting in a Dobhoff placement. The patient also has low calcium levels, which were corrected by adding albumin to the labs. The patient's blood pressure is hypotensive in the 80s/40s, but previous arterial line readings showed higher pressures. The patient is putting out about 50-80 cc of urine per hour and is mentating at baseline. Given the patient's history of VT, a decision was made to give metoprolol 12.5 mg twice instead of 25 mg at once. The patient's allergies include penicillins, causing hives and rash, and Ambien, causing light-headedness. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 81 bpm, blood pressure 101/36 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular-paced. The patient's weight is currently 96.8 kg, and his height is 72 inches. The patient has received a total of 1,713 mL of fluids and has lost 1,970 mL of blood products, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -257 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.29, PCO2 45 mmHg, PO2 106 mmHg, and HCO3- 29 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses and skin that is not assessed. The patient's labs reveal elevated potassium levels at 4.81 K/uL and low sodium levels at 125 mEq/L. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating between 6.2 and 11.0 thousand/mm3. The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily decreasing from 1.3 to 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's glucose levels have been within the normal range, ranging from 103 to 130 mg/dL. The patient's other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormal cardiac markers. The patient's imaging reveals no new findings, and his microbiology results are negative. The patient's assessment and plan include ventricular tachycardia, delirium/confusion, community-acquired pneumonia, fever, dysphagia, acute systolic heart failure, and sepsis. The patient is currently on ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia increases the risk of recurrent episodes, which can be life-threatening.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status and confusion may worsen, potentially leading to further complications such as falls or difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Community-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia can progress and lead to worsening respiratory distress, sepsis, or other complications.
4. Fever: The patient's fever indicates an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
5. Dysphagia: The patient's swallowing difficulties may result in aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition if not managed appropriately.
6. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure can worsen, leading to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, or cardiogenic shock.
7. Sepsis: The patient's infection and inflammatory response may progress to sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
8. Negative Fluid Balance: The patient's negative fluid balance indicates a risk of dehydration and potential kidney injury.
9. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may indicate poor organ perfusion and increase the risk of complications such as renal dysfunction or tissue hypoxia.
10. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, particularly the high potassium levels, need to be corrected to avoid cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness."

   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   .
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday pending patient and
   family are in agreement

   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   -Pt to be NPO Wednesday after MN, and will have 4 units crossmatched
   then
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Prior
   to second arrest, patient was satting well on 2L NC. Had increased O2
   requirement after arrest, thought to be related to aspiration
   pneumonitis, but now satting well on 2L NC. This is still above
   baseline as he does not usually use supplemental oxygen.  Heart failure
   less likely etiology of hypoxia and received home dose PO lasix this
   am.  Speech and swallow evaluated this am and recommend PNO for now
   except meds with repeat video swallow study.
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Consider surgery consult for PEG once pacer issue is resolved
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue home dose of PO Lasix
   - Add Lasix 40mg IV ONCE today given no response to 40 PO + 20 IV
   -check PM Is/Os
 if not 1 to 1.5 L negative will give one dose IV 40
   mg lasix as yesterday pt required extra IV dose
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   .
   # Hypotension: [**Month (only) 51**] be medication induced versus being hypovolemic. Is
   near his baseline for the past few days, in past ranges from 80s-130s.
   -Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had overall marked improvement in past 2
   days.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Fever/Pneumonia: Now afebrile status post completed course of
   antibiotics. Previously, patient was spiking high fevers in spite of
   Tylenol, antibiotics, and improvement of pneumonia. This led to concern
   about an occult infection or non-infectious cause of fever. CT
   abd/pelvis and CT sinuses were negative. TEE showed no vegetation.
   There was one positive blood cx (coag neg staph), thought to be a
   contaminant.  Patient was afebrile from [**Date range (1) 14227**], but spiked one fever
   to 101.8 thought to be related to possible aspiration pneumonitis in
   setting of recent arrest. Has been afebrile since.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pending microbiological studies which currently show no growth.
   Urine cultuire [**3-17**] negative
   - no abx for now except chronic suppressive cefpodoxime therapy for
   history of device infection
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose
   - will check Is/Os and if not 1-1.5 L negative will give extra 40 mg IV
   lasix
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to altered mental status/inability to take
   adequate PO.
   - patient was given free water with D5W last night and sodium slightly
   improved, however pt more volume up
   - will consider giving free water if pm labs show worsening
   hypernatremia (and orally if patient can take PO)
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient starts to eat.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea, initially thought to be due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation but later attributed to pneumonia. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one arrest that required external defibrillation. 

The patient has been diagnosed with sustained ventricular tachycardia, delirium/confusion, pneumonia (community-acquired), fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), dysphagia, heart failure (systolic, acute), and hypoxia. 

Assessment and Plan:

   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   .
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday - patient and family are
   in agreement
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   -Pt to be NPO Wednesday after MN, and will have 4 units crossmatched
   for procedure
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Consider surgery consult for PEG once pacer issue is resolved
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue home dose of PO Lasix
   - Add Lasix 40mg IV ONCE today given no response to 40 PO + 20 IV
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   .
   # Hypotension: [**Month (only) 51**] be medication induced versus being hypovolemic. Is
   near his baseline for the past few days, in past ranges from 80s-130s.
   -Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had overall marked improvement in past 2
   days. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient starts to eat.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a heart failure exacerbation but was subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of an infiltrate, fever, and white blood cell count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia and heart failure. Continuous oxygen therapy is required to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status characterized by disorientation and waxing and waning alertness. Delirium can be caused by recent intubation, sedating medications, and ICU environment.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia with an infiltrate on chest X-ray. Antibiotics have been initiated, but close monitoring"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2141-3-20**]
   - EP recommended against calling pt out because he's already had two VT
   arrests and now is without an ICD back-up, code blue response much
   slower on floor than CCU, thus, we did not call him out to the floor
   - speech and swallow evaulated and thought at high aspiration risk.
   recommended NPO and consider PEG
   - [**Name (NI) 461**] HCP wants to talk with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14279**] before any decisions are
   made regarding surgery for ICD revision
   - patient failed video swallow had dobhoff placed
   - nutrition recs to start isosource TF at 25 cc/hr and titrate up to 55
   cc/hr
   - ordered fluoro guided PICC replacement (since was pulled out with
   dressing change) which will happen tomorrow
   - Ca low so added on albumin to labs, is 3.0 - correct to 9.0.
   - Hypotensive to 80s/40s by NBP, but A-line in the past showed higher
   pressures, patient putting out about 50-80 cc urine per hour and
   mentating at baseline. Given past VT, decided to give metoprolol 12.5
   mg then 12.5 mg, instead of 25mg at one time
   - EP recs:
   ICD malfunction: Fidelis RV coil fracture
   -Tentative left sided single lead extraction (Fidelis) and new ICD lead
   placement Thursday with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5152**]

","The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea, and the 24-hour events include episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrests, ICD malfunction, pneumonia, and delirium. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and an anterior wall myocardial infarction. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to medication-induced effects or hypovolemia. Close monitoring is recommended.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is disoriented and exhibiting signs of delirium, likely caused by recent intubation and sedating medications. Minimizing sedating medications and providing a supportive environment are important in managing this condition.
3. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF 20-25%). Continuing Lasix at home dose and monitoring electrolyte levels are essential.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had an elevated sodium level, which has since normalized. Monitoring sodium levels is crucial to prevent future complications.
5. Elevated CK: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level was elevated, likely due to statin use. Holding the statin and monitoring CK levels are necessary.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. Continuing aspirin and metoprolol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), old anterior wall myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation. However, it was later determined that he had pneumonia due to an infiltrate on chest X-ray, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, reintubation, and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia/Ventricular Fibrillation (VT/VF): The patient has a history of VT/VF and has experienced multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest that required external defibrillation. The ICD is currently not functioning properly, and if the patient develops VT, he will need external therapy.

2. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to suspected pneumonia and heart failure. Although he is currently resolving, he drifts down to high 80s while sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed obstructive sleep"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for systolic heart failure, previous anterior wall myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, history of ventricular fibrillation, and status post biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and reported having a cough productive of dark beige sputum, along with low-grade temperatures at home.

The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone various interventions, including PICC line placement, central venous catheterization, and administration of heparin sodium. Other medications given include lorazepam for sedation. The patient's vital signs have been monitored, showing fluctuations in temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures have revealed the presence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Imaging shows a dobbhoff catheter in the proximal stomach, with no significant changes in the chest X-ray.

Assessment and plan:
1. Ventricular tachycardia, sustained.
2. Delirium/confusion.
3. Pneumonia, bacterial, community"

   Subsequent blood cultures on [**3-13**],26 - no growth so far.
   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   .
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday - patient and family are
   in agreement
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   -Pt to be after MN, and will have 4 units crossmatched for procedure
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Consider surgery consult for PEG once pacer issue is resolved
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue home dose of PO Lasix
   - Judge whether further Lasix required
 good output beginning to 20 mg
   IV earlier this a.m.
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), old anterior wall myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He has a history of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation with subsequent revisions due to malfunctioning leads.

The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and was initially thought to be experiencing a congestive heart failure exacerbation. However, subsequent evaluation revealed pneumonia in the setting of an infiltrate, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, reintubation, and multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one ventricular tachycardia arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia/ventricular Fibrillation arrest: The patient has had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrest if not promptly managed.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure due to pneumonia may result in low oxygen levels in the blood, leading to hypoxia. This can cause symptoms such"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   .
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday - patient and family are
   in agreement

   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA.

   IV earlier this a.m.
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia and heart failure. Although the patient's condition is currently resolving, there is a possibility of further deterioration.

2. ICD malfunction: The patient's implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has malfunctioned multiple times, leading to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrests. This indicates an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection with Staphylococcus coagulase-negative isolated from blood cultures. This suggests that the patient may have developed pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

4. Altered mental status: The patient is disoriented and showing signs of delirium, possibly due to recent intubation and sedating medications. Delirium can progress to severe agitation, increased risk of falls, and other complications.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is near his baseline but has fluctuated in the past, making it difficult to determine if the hypotension is medication-induced or due to volume depletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent hypoperfusion and organ damage.

6. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection"

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday - patient and family are
   in agreement
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   -Pt to be after MN, and will have 4 units crossmatched for procedure
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Consider surgery consult for PEG once pacer issue is resolved
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue home dose of PO Lasix
   - Judge whether further Lasix required
 good output beginning to 20 mg
   IV earlier this a.m.
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   .
   # Hypotension: [**Month (only) 51**] be medication induced versus being hypovolemic. Is
   near his baseline for the past few days, in past ranges from 80s-130s.
   Diuresis gently continues, and likely to be safe.
   -Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had overall marked improvement in past 2
   days. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete. Failed videoswallow so
   NPO for now.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   - Consider neuropsychological outpatient follow-up
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose when possible
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow.
   - NPO and consider GI to help with bridled NGT

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), old anterior wall myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and a history of ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to be experiencing a congestive heart failure exacerbation. However, subsequent evaluation revealed pneumonia, as evidenced by infiltrate, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. 

During his hospital course, the patient experienced high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, reintubation, and multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia. The etiology of the recent increased ectopy is believed to be related to pacemaker settings and QT prolongation in the setting of amiodarone therapy. Additionally, a fractured right ventricular coil was found. 

The plan moving forward includes tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday, with the patient and family in agreement. The patient will continue on amiodarone 200 mg daily and metoprolol 25 mg. Telemetry will be continued, and the patient will be monitored for ventricular tachycardia, requiring external therapy as the ICD is not functioning.

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday - patient and family are
   in agreement
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   -Pt to be after MN, and will have 4 units crossmatched for procedure
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Consider surgery consult for PEG once pacer issue is resolved
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue home dose of PO Lasix
   - Judge whether further Lasix required
 good output beginning to 20 mg
   IV earlier this a.m.
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   .
   # Hypotension: [**Month (only) 51**] be medication induced versus being hypovolemic. Is
   near his baseline for the past few days, in past ranges from 80s-130s.
   Diuresis gently continues, and likely to be safe.
   -Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had overall marked improvement in past 2
   days. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete. Failed videoswallow so
   NPO for now.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   - Consider neuropsychological outpatient follow-up
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose when possible
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow.
   - NPO and consider GI to help with bridled NGT

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of an infiltrate, fever, and white count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, reintubation, and runs of VT including one VT arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation: The patient has a history of VT/VF and recent runs of VT, including one VT arrest. Close monitoring and management of cardiac rhythm is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with pneumonia, which may have contributed to his initial dyspnea and subsequent intubation. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy is important.
3. ICD dysfunction: The patient's ICD lead was found to be fractured, leading to an unsuccessful defibrillation attempt during a VT/VF arrest. Ensuring proper functioning of the ICD and addressing any issues promptly is crucial.
4. Delirium: The patient is disoriented and exhibiting signs of altered mental status,"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction in 2006, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with chief complaints of dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one ventricular tachycardia arrest. 

The patient had a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest on March 12th during which the ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy. Subsequently, the patient has had multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one ventricular tachycardia arrest which required external defibrillation. The etiology of recent increased ectopy is thought to be fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in the setting of amiodarone. The right ventricular coil was found to be fractured."

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: S/p successful fractured lead removal and now
   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Subsequently,
   patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which
   required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy
   thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT
   prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was found to be
   fractured.
   -restart Coumadin
   -heparin SC BID then IV 24hrs after procedure
   -cefpodoxime for one week from today
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   .
   # Intubation: Pt intubed from procedure.
   - Extubate today, stop sedation prior, then afterward try to wean
   pressor
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA. Got some 2L or so of
   fluid yesterday.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Consider surgery consult for PEG once pacer issue is resolved
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   - Judge whether further Lasix required
 good output beginning to 20 mg
   IV earlier this a.m.
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely [**1-24**] propofol as has improved after weaning
   down propofol.
   -Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had overall marked improvement in past 2
   days. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete. Failed videoswallow so
   NPO for now.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   - Consider neuropsychological outpatient follow-up
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose when possible
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow.
   - NPO and consider GI to help with bridled NGT

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest. The patient had a fractured ICD lead, which was successfully removed and replaced. He has been intubated from the procedure and is planned for extubation today. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, hypotension, altered mental status, chronic systolic heart failure, hypernatremia, elevated creatine kinase (CK), coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, anemia, and post-Whipple dysphagia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest due to ICD malfunction.
2. Pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis.
3. Delirium due to intubation, sedating medications, and ICU environment.
4. Hypotension possibly related"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with dyspnea and worsened CHF. They experienced VT/VF and had a fractured ICD lead. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and invasive ventilation. An arterial line was started, and the patient underwent two lead extractions, ICD implantation without complications. The patient was returned to the floor intubated on propofol, with stable hematocrit despite reported blood loss. The plan for extubation on 3/24 was discussed. The patient's allergies include penicillins, hives, and rash, as well as lightheadedness from Ambien. The last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 3/24 at 1:00 AM. The patient is currently on propofol and phenylephrine infusions, along with other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT/VF) - The patient experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.
2. Fractured ICD Lead - The fractured ICD lead poses a risk of ineffective pacing and potential complications related to the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
3. Delirium/Confusion - The patient has been assessed with delirium/confusion, which can increase the risk of falls, injuries, and other medical complications.

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.
   -Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday - patient and family are
   in agreement
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   -continue Telemetry
   -if develops VT, will need external therapy as ICD is not functioning
   -Pt to be after MN, and will have 4 units crossmatched for procedure
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Consider surgery consult for PEG once pacer issue is resolved
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue home dose of PO Lasix
   - Judge whether further Lasix required
 good output beginning to 20 mg
   IV earlier this a.m.
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   .
   # Hypotension: [**Month (only) 51**] be medication induced versus being hypovolemic. Is
   near his baseline for the past few days, in past ranges from 80s-130s.
   Diuresis gently continues, and likely to be safe.
   -Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely recent
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. Pt has had overall marked improvement in past 2
   days. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete. Failed videoswallow so
   NPO for now.
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   - Consider neuropsychological outpatient follow-up
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose when possible
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding Coumadin; started heparin gtt in anticipation of possible EP
   procedure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow.
   - NPO and consider GI to help with bridled NGT

   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which
   ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Subsequently, patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT
   arrest which required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent
   increased ectopy thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer
   settings, and QT prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was
   found to be fractured.

   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA.

 good output beginning to 20 mg
   IV earlier this a.m.
   - F/u Is/Os

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after ICD implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white blood count. The hospital course was complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: The patient experienced multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which required external defibrillation. The etiology of recent increased ectopy is thought to be fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in the setting of amiodarone. The RV coil was found to be fractured. Tentative plans for ICD revision on Thursday are in agreement with the patient and family.
2. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure. Currently resolving, but drifts down to high 80s while sleeping, possibly related to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after ICD implantation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white blood count. His hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia/VT/VF Arrest: The patient has had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which required defibrillation. There is a risk of recurrent VT/VF arrests.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an ongoing pneumonia that needs to be treated and monitored.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is disoriented and has an altered mental status, likely due to intubation, sedating medications, and the ICU environment. Frequent reorientation and minimizing sedating medications are important.
4. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia, which requires further evaluation and consideration for a percutaneous"

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: S/p successful fractured lead removal and now
   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Subsequently,
   patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which
   required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy
   thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT
   prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was found to be
   fractured, now removed and replaced.
   -restarting Coumadin
   -heparin IV weight based protocol bridge to coumadin
   -cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   .
   # Hypoxia: Resolving. Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for
   hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart
   failure. Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high
   80s while sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA. Got some 2L or
   so of fluid yesterday.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Look into speech and swallow evaluations to see if delirium has been
   masking ability to swallow. If not, then consider surgery consult for
   PEG
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete. Failed
   videoswallow so NPO for now.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Maintain adequate bowel regimen
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   - Consider neuropsychological outpatient follow-up
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose when possible
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarting coumadin; started heparin gtt for bridging
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow.
   - NPO, tube feeds

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: S/p successful fractured lead removal and now
   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Subsequently,
   patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which
   required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy
   thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT
   prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was found to be
   fractured, now removed and replaced.
   -restart Coumadin
   -heparin IV weight based protocol with an at least 3 day overlap on
   therapeutic INR
   -cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart failure.
   Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high 80s while
   sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA. Got some 2L or so of
   fluid yesterday.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Consider surgery consult for PEG once pacer issue is resolved
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   - Judge whether further Lasix required
 good output beginning to 20 mg
   IV yesterday
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete. Failed
   videoswallow so NPO for now.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Maintain adequate bowel regimen
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   - Consider neuropsychological outpatient follow-up
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose when possible
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarting coumadin; started heparin gtt for bridging
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow.
   - NPO, tube feeds

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation post ICD implantation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count.

The patient's hospital course was complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of VT, including one VT arrest. The etiology of the recent increased ectopy is thought to be fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in the setting of amiodarone. The right ventricular coil was found to be fractured, which has been removed and replaced.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of VT/VF, including one VT arrest requiring external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy includes fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in the setting of amiodarone. The patient now has a new"

The patient is extubated but very agitated, requiring two doses of ativan IV. He has a history of heart failure, pneumonia, delirium, dysphagia, and ventricular tachycardia. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 96.8 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,363 mL, including 336 mL of IV fluids, and a total output of 1,895 mL. The patient is on high flow nasal cannula oxygen with a FiO2 of 40%. ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.23. Labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin-T levels, along with decreased platelet count, sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. The patient's medical history and review of systems are unchanged from admission. The patient's physical examination is incomplete due to agitation.

   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: S/p successful fractured lead removal and now
   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Subsequently,
   patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which
   required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy
   thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT
   prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was found to be
   fractured, now removed and replaced.

   # Mental Status
   Delirium markedly exacerbated by many psychotropics and sedatives. D/w
   geriatrics today. They also feel that there is baseline hypoxic injury
   with likely superimposed neurodegenerative disease. Given possibility
   of [**Last Name (un) **] Body Disease, they recommend not using Haldol or ativan, but
   instead using Seroquel or, if this is not possible, then Zydis. Avoid
   Haldol because of likely underlying disease and
   arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Also taper Paxil because elderly and
   has significant RLS/PLMD.
   - per [**Female First Name (un) **]. Team
 Seroquel 12.5 mg QAM then 12.5 Q6H PRN agitation
   making sure not to score limb movements as agitation.
   - Taper Paxil once discussed why he is on this (there may be a good
   reason)
   - Avoid Haldol and ativan
   - Use Zydis 2.5 mg wafer if cannot given Serquel.
   # Hypoxia
   Resolving
 doing well on nasal canula. Patient was intubated from
   [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia
   + heart failure. Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down
   to high 80s while sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA. Got
   some 2L or so of fluid yesterday.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow, but reevaluate given Dopoff removed again.
   -If delirium has not been cause of dysphagia then consider surgery
   consult for PEG (per Geriatrics)
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as

   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after ICD implantation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white blood cell count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of ventricular tachycardia including one ventricular tachycardia arrest.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration, as evidenced by infiltrate, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. Antibiotic therapy has been completed, and the patient is currently on nasal cannula for oxygen supplementation.
2. Hypoxia: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is resolving. The etiology of hypoxia is likely pneumonia and heart failure. The patient may have undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, as oxygen saturation drifts down to the high 80s while sleeping.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing del"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but later attributed to pneumonia. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, reintubation, and runs of VT.

Plan:
1. VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: Successful fractured lead removal and new functional ICD lead placement.
2. Mental Status: Delirium exacerbated by psychotropics and sedatives. Geriatrics recommend avoiding Haldol due to underlying disease and arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Seroquel or Zydis to be used as alternatives.
3. Hypoxia: Resolving, on nasal canula. Wean O2 as tolerated.
4. Aspiration precautions, NPO per speech and swallow consultation, considering PEG if delirium not the cause of dysphagia.
5. Chronic systolic heart failure: Continue PO Lasix at home dose, f/u Is/Os, continue metoprolol.
6. Hypernatremia: Normalized.
7. Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin therapy. Holding statin for"

   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: S/p successful fractured lead removal and now
   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Subsequently,
   patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which
   required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy
   thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT
   prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was found to be
   fractured, now removed and replaced.
   -restarting Coumadin
   -heparin IV weight based protocol bridge to coumadin
   -cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   .
   # Hypoxia: Resolving. Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for
   hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart
   failure. Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high
   80s while sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA. Got some 2L or
   so of fluid yesterday.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Look into speech and swallow evaluations to see if delirium has been
   masking ability to swallow. If not, then consider surgery consult for
   PEG
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete. Failed
   videoswallow so NPO for now.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Maintain adequate bowel regimen
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   - Consider neuropsychological outpatient follow-up
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose when possible
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarting coumadin; started heparin gtt for bridging
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was initially thought to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation. However, it was later determined that his symptoms were due to pneumonia, evidenced by the presence of an infiltrate on chest X-ray, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, and multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and heart failure. His oxygen saturation levels drift down to the high 80s while sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is disoriented, waxing and waning in attention, and exhibiting a reversal of sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. The etiology is likely due to intubation, sedating medications, and the ICU environment. No focal neurologic deficits have been observed, and his urinalysis is negative.

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring debrillation and reintubation, and
   runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: S/p successful fractured lead removal and now
   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Subsequently,
   patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which
   required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy
   thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT
   prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was found to be
   fractured, now removed and replaced.
   -restarting Coumadin
   -heparin IV weight based protocol bridge to coumadin
   -cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG
   .
   # Hypoxia: Resolving. Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 14185**] for
   hypoxemic respiratory failure. Etiology likely pneumonia + heart
   failure. Currently resolving, was on room air, but drifts down to high
   80s while sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed OSA. Got some 2L or
   so of fluid yesterday.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   -Look into speech and swallow evaluations to see if delirium has been
   masking ability to swallow. If not, then consider surgery consult for
   PEG
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime, which patient takes chronically as
   outpt) as patient was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis rather than
   true pneumonia and ABX course completed for PNA.
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], reversal of
   sleep/wake cycle characteristic of delirium. Etiology is likely
   intubation (with sedating meds) and ICU environment. No focal
   neurologic deficits. U/A negative. Abx course for PNA complete. Failed
   videoswallow so NPO for now.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Maintain adequate bowel regimen
   - continue to follow clinically
   - minimize sedating medications
   - Avoid ativan, try haldol for last resort
   - Geriatrics consult today
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently
   euvolemic.
   - continue PO Lasix at home dose when possible
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarting coumadin; started heparin gtt for bridging
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow.
   - NPO, tube feeds
   - Will need to consider PEG in future

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of heart failure and subsequent development of ventricular tachycardia. The patient has been experiencing delirium, agitation, and restlessness, particularly at night, and has required frequent restraints to prevent falls. He has had episodes of hypotension and required aggressive fluid resuscitation. Despite this, his blood pressure remains unstable. The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by increasing serum creatinine levels. His electrolyte imbalances need correction, particularly low potassium levels. There is a concern regarding the patient's ability to regain significant swallow function, and the possibility of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement should be discussed with the family. The patient's arterial line stopped, and he continues to require vasopressors. There is a need for ongoing monitoring and management of his various medical conditions and potential complications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient is already experiencing sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can potentially lead to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's heart failure is worsening, evidenced by his low blood pressure, high jugular venous pressure, and pulmonary congestion. This can lead to further fluid accumulation and respiratory"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple health issues. The note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sustained ventricular tachycardia, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where the heart's ventricles beat abnormally fast.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which can be caused by various factors such as medication side effects, infection, or other underlying medical conditions.

3. Pneumonia (Bacterial, Community Acquired): The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, which is an infection in one or both lungs caused by bacteria. This condition can worsen if left untreated.

4. Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia): The patient has a fever, indicating an elevated body temperature that may be a sign of infection or another underlying condition.

5. Dysphagia: The patient is experiencing difficulty swallowing, known as dysphagia. This can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and complications related to feeding and nutrition.

6. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: The patient is suffering from acute systolic heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively. This can lead to further complications such as fluid overload and respiratory distress.

These are some of the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the"

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: S/p successful fractured lead removal and now
   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Subsequently,
   patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which
   required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy
   thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT
   prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was found to be
   fractured, now removed and replaced on [**2141-3-21**].
   -cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG (avoid Haldol)
   #hypotension: This am pt noted to have hypotension with SBPs in the
   high 60
s upon sitting in chair.  Concern for tampenade given recent
   lead revision.  However, pulsus was 10 mm hg which is baseline for the
   patient.  STAT echo obtained showed no evidence of  effusion.  Pt given
   250 cc NS and BP corrected to 90s.  Likely etiology is intravascular
   depletion in setting of poor PO intake.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - small boluses PRN
   - hold lasix
   - BP holding parameters on metoprolol
   # Mental Status
   Delirium markedly exacerbated by many psychotropics and sedatives. D/w
   geriatrics and appreciate their recommendations.  The patient likely
   had hypoxic injury, ICU delirium, with possible undderlying
   neurodegenerative disease. Given possibility of [**Last Name (un) **] Body Disease, they
   recommended not using Haldol or ativan, but instead using Seroquel or,
   if this is not possible, then Zydis. Avoid Haldol because of likely
   underlying disease and arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Also taper Paxil
   because of the anticholinergic properties. Last night the patient
   agitation was improved with seroquel, however he was heavily sedated
   this am.  Of note, we should make sure not to score limb movements
   (restless legs) as agitation.
   - decrease Seroquel to 6.25 (if possible) for standing dose before
   bedtime with repeat x 1 if no result within 1 hour
   - if pt requires more sedation overnight may try PRN seroquel, or if
   unable to give may try zydis x 1 PRN
   - try to avoid sedation during the day to preserve better sleep/wake
   cycle
   - Taper paxil to 20 mg q day
   - Avoid Haldol and ativan
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow on multiple occasions.  Had NGT but removed
   several times by patient.  Mental status improving and pt tolerated
   applesauce last night.  However, failed repeat swallow study this am.
   - consider PEG tube for short term nutrition as pt has potential to
   improve with time once ICU delirium/mental status improves
   - NPO except meds
   # Hypoxia
   Resolving
 doing well on nasal canula. Patient was intubated from
   [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure from pneumonia + heart
   failure.  Reintubated for pacemaker revision.  Was on room air, but
   drifts down to high 80s while sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed
   OSA.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime for one week as above)
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue coumadin
   - continue heparin gtt until bridged (INR 1.2)
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic.
   - holding PO lasix given hypotension this am
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now, but may consider restarting different [**Doctor Last Name **]
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given
   hypotension)
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been noted to have hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the high 60s upon sitting. There is concern for tamponade given recent lead revision; however, the patient's baseline pulse was 10 mm Hg. A stat echo showed no evidence of effusion. The likely etiology is intravascular depletion in the setting of poor oral intake.
2. Mental Status: The patient has delirium that has been exacerbated by multiple psychotropics and sedatives. The geriatrics team recommended using Seroquel or Zydis instead of Haldol or Ativan due to the possibility of underlying neurodegenerative disease. The patient's agitation was improved with Seroquel last night, but"

   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to

   geriatrics yesterday. They also feel that there is baseline hypoxic
   injury with likely superimposed neurodegenerative disease. Given
   possibility of [**Last Name (un) **] Body Disease, they recommended not using Haldol or
   ativan, but instead using Seroquel or, if this is not possible, then
   Zydis. Avoid Haldol because of likely underlying disease and
   arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Also taper Paxil because elderly and
   has significant RLS/PLMD. Last night the patient
s agitation was
   improved with seroquel.
   - continu Seroquel 12.5 mg QAM then 12.5 Q6H PRN agitation

   sure not to score limb movements as agitation.
   - Discuss Paxil use, then taper Paxil if possible
   - Avoid Haldol and ativan
   - Use Zydis 2.5 mg dissolving if cannot give Seroquel.

   recommended not using Haldol or ativan, but instead using Seroquel or,
   if this is not possible, then Zydis. Avoid Haldol because of likely
   underlying disease and arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Also taper Paxil
   because of the anticholinergic properties. Last night the patient
   agitation was improved with seroquel, however he was heavily sedated
   this am.  Of note, we should make sure not to score limb movements
   (restless legs) as agitation.
   - decrease Seroquel to 6.25 (if possible) for standing dose before
   bedtime with repeat x 1 if no result within 1 hour
   - if pt requires more sedation overnight may try PRN seroquel, or if
   unable to give may try zydis x 1 PRN

   on:[**2141-3-29**] 14:47 ------
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been noted to have hypotension with SBPs in the high 60s upon sitting. This could be due to tamponade, especially given recent lead revision. However, a STAT echo showed no evidence of effusion. The likely etiology is intravascular depletion in the setting of poor PO intake.

2. Mental status changes: The patient has been experiencing delirium, which has been exacerbated by many psychotropics and sedatives. The underlying cause could be hypoxic injury, ICU delirium, or an underlying neurodegenerative disease. There is a concern for underlying [Last Name] Body Disease, and the patient may require a different medication to manage agitation.

3. Dysphagia: The patient failed video swallow on multiple occasions and had an NGT that was removed several times by the patient. Mental status is improving, but the patient still failed a repeat swallow study this morning. Considering a PEG tube for short-term nutrition as the patient has potential to improve with time once ICU delirium/mental status improves.

4. Hypoxia: The patient was previously intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure from pneumonia and heart failure. He was reintubated for pacemaker revision and was on room air but drifted down to high 80s while sleeping, possibly related to und"

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic, perhaps slightly low
   intravascular given recent hypotension.
   - Holding PO lasix given recent hypotension and NPO
   - F/u Is/Os
   - Continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Hypotension
   Low blood pressure yesterday a.m. and then later in the day
 responded
   to small boluses. No tampenade physiology
 normal echo and pulsus of
   10 mmHg. Likely due to being NPO.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - small boluses PRN, rather than maintenance fluids
   - hold lasix
   - BP holding parameters on metoprolol
   # VT/VF/AF/
   ICD dysfunction with fractured lead, now successfully replaced for dual
   chamber. Paced continually now. Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during
   which ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Some VT following. Etiology of recent increased ectopy thought to be
   [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in
   setting of amiodarone. Now not a problem. Past-history of AF,
   non-active, but given apical akinesis, should definitely be
   anticoagulated. RV coil was found to be fractured, now removed and
   replaced on [**2141-3-21**].
   - cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   - f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   - continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - monitor QTC on EKG (avoid Haldol)
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarting Coumadin, bridged with heparin gtt
   # Mental Status
   Patient has evidence of ischemic injury on CT (white matter hypodense
   in watershed between ACA and MCA left posterior frontal. Some frontal
   release on exam (grasp). Some mild dysarthria with dysphagia, per S&S
   (see below). Delirium markedly exacerbated by many psychotropics and
   sedatives. D/w geriatrics and appreciated their recommendations.  The
   patient likely had hypoxic injury, ICU delirium, with possible
   underlying neurodegenerative disease. Given possibility of [**Last Name (un) **] Body
   Disease, they recommended not using Haldol or ativan, but instead using
   Seroquel or, if this is not possible, then Zydis. Avoid Haldol because
   of likely underlying disease and arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Also
   taper Paxil because of its anticholinergic properties and exacerbation
   of akathisia. Initial dose of seroquel was very sedating (12.5) so
   halved and standing dose shifted from am to pm.  Of note, we should
   make sure not to score limb movements (restless legs) as agitation.
   - Seroquel to 6.25 mg PO QPM with repeat x 1 if no result within 1 hour
   - if pt requires more sedation overnight may try PRN seroquel, or if
   unable to give may try zydis x 1 PRN
   - try to avoid sedation during the day to preserve better sleep/wake
   cycle
   - Taper paxil to 20 mg q day
   - Avoid Haldol and Ativan
   - Talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14448**] about pre-admission mental status
   # Dysphagia and dysarthria
   Dysarthria may suggest that dysphagia likely to show little recovery.
   Failed video swallow on multiple occasions.  Had NGT but removed five
   times by patient.  Mental status improving and pt tolerated applesauce
   last night.  However, failed repeat swallow study yesterday. Reluctant
   to place PEG, as not good long-term solution (aspiration risk just as
   high as swallowing), but will talk to electrophysiologist (Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5758**] who knows the patient well and can likely comment on
   neurologic function at baseline.
   - D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14449**]
   - Consider PEG versus bridled NGT (depending on above concerns) for
   short term nutrition as pt has potential to improve with time once ICU
   delirium/mental status improves
   - NPO except meds
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note, the patient
   did report some chest pressure previously, but this has since
   resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given
   hypotension)
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but later attributed to pneumonia. His hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of ventricular tachycardia.

Medical Complications:
1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He is currently euvolemic but may be slightly low intravascularly given recent hypotension. He is holding oral lasix due to recent hypotension and is NPO. His blood pressure is being monitored, and small boluses of normal saline are given as needed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure responded to small boluses of normal saline. No tamponade physiology was observed, and the echo showed normal findings. The likely cause of hypotension is being NPO. His blood pressure is being continuously monitored, and small boluses of normal saline are given as needed.
3. Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation/atrial"

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic, perhaps slightly low
   intravascular given recent hypotension.
   - Holding PO lasix given recent hypotension and NPO
   - F/u Is/Os
   - Continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Hypotension
   Low blood pressure yesterday a.m. and then later in the day
 responded
   to small boluses. No tampenade physiology
 normal echo and pulsus of
   10 mmHg. Likely due to being NPO.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - small boluses PRN, rather than maintenance fluids
   - hold lasix
   - BP holding parameters on metoprolol
   # VT/VF/AF/
   ICD dysfunction with fractured lead, now successfully replaced for dual
   chamber. Paced continually now. Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during
   which ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Some VT following. Etiology of recent increased ectopy thought to be
   [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in
   setting of amiodarone. Now not a problem. Past-history of AF,
   non-active, but given apical akinesis, should definitely be
   anticoagulated. RV coil was found to be fractured, now removed and
   replaced on [**2141-3-21**].
   - cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   - f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   - continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - monitor QTC on EKG (avoid Haldol)
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarting Coumadin, bridged with heparin gtt
   # Mental Status
   Patient has evidence of ischemic injury on CT (white matter hypodense
   in watershed between ACA and MCA left posterior frontal. Some frontal
   release on exam (grasp). Some mild dysarthria with dysphagia, per S&S
   (see below). Delirium markedly exacerbated by many psychotropics and
   sedatives. D/w geriatrics and appreciated their recommendations.  The
   patient likely had hypoxic injury, ICU delirium, with possible
   underlying neurodegenerative disease. Given possibility of [**Last Name (un) **] Body
   Disease, they recommended not using Haldol or ativan, but instead using
   Seroquel or, if this is not possible, then Zydis. Avoid Haldol because
   of likely underlying disease and arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Also
   taper Paxil because of its anticholinergic properties and exacerbation
   of akathisia. Initial dose of seroquel was very sedating (12.5) so
   halved and standing dose shifted from am to pm.  Of note, we should
   make sure not to score limb movements (restless legs) as agitation.
   - Seroquel to 6.25 mg PO QPM with repeat x 1 if no result within 1 hour
   - if pt requires more sedation overnight may try PRN seroquel, or if
   unable to give may try zydis x 1 PRN
   - try to avoid sedation during the day to preserve better sleep/wake
   cycle
   - Taper paxil to 20 mg q day
   - Avoid Haldol and Ativan
   - Talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14448**] about pre-admission mental status
   # Dysphagia and dysarthria
   Dysarthria may suggest that dysphagia likely to show little recovery.
   Failed video swallow on multiple occasions.  Had NGT but removed five
   times by patient.  Mental status improving and pt tolerated applesauce
   last night.  However, failed repeat swallow study yesterday. Reluctant
   to place PEG, as not good long-term solution (aspiration risk just as
   high as swallowing), but will talk to electrophysiologist (Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5758**] who knows the patient well and can likely comment on
   neurologic function at baseline.
   - D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14449**]
   - Consider PEG versus bridled NGT (depending on above concerns) for
   short term nutrition as pt has potential to improve with time once ICU
   delirium/mental status improves
   - NPO except meds
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note, the patient
   did report some chest pressure previously, but this has since
   resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given
   hypotension)
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant medical history of systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation post implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of an infiltrate, fever, and white blood cell count.

The patient's hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of ventricular tachycardia, including one ventricular tachycardia arrest. The patient's mental status has fluctuated, and there is evidence of ischemic injury on CT (white matter hypodense in watershed between anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery, left posterior frontal). Some frontal release on examination (grasp). Some mild dysarthria with dysphagia.

The patient's current plan includes chronic systolic heart failure management, hypotension management, VT/VF/AF/ICD dysfunction management, mental status management, dysphagia and dysarthria management, coronary artery disease management, hypothyroidism"

   Assessment
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest.
   Plan
   # VT/VF/ICD dysfunction: S/p successful fractured lead removal and now
   new functional ICD lead placement.
   Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during which ICD failed to
   defibrillate him and he required external therapy.  Subsequently,
   patient has had multiple runs of VT, including one VT arrest which
   required external defibrillation. Etiology of recent increased ectopy
   thought to be [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT
   prolongation in setting of amiodarone. RV coil was found to be
   fractured, now removed and replaced on [**2141-3-21**].
   -cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   -f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   -continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -monitor QTC on EKG (avoid Haldol)
   #hypotension: This am pt noted to have hypotension with SBPs in the
   high 60
s upon sitting in chair.  Concern for tampenade given recent
   lead revision.  However, pulsus was 10 mm hg which is baseline for the
   patient.  STAT echo obtained showed no evidence of  effusion.  Pt given
   250 cc NS and BP corrected to 90s.  Likely etiology is intravascular
   depletion in setting of poor PO intake.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - small boluses PRN
   - hold lasix
   - BP holding parameters on metoprolol
   # Mental Status
   Delirium markedly exacerbated by many psychotropics and sedatives. D/w
   geriatrics and appreciate their recommendations.  The patient likely
   had hypoxic injury, ICU delirium, with possible undderlying
   neurodegenerative disease. Given possibility of [**Last Name (un) **] Body Disease, they
   recommended not using Haldol or ativan, but instead using Seroquel or,
   if this is not possible, then Zydis. Avoid Haldol because of likely
   underlying disease and arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Also taper Paxil
   because of the anticholinergic properties. Last night the patient
   agitation was improved with seroquel, however he was heavily sedated
   this am.  Of note, we should make sure not to score limb movements
   (restless legs) as agitation.
   - decrease Seroquel to 6.25 (if possible) for standing dose before
   bedtime with repeat x 1 if no result within 1 hour
   - if pt requires more sedation overnight may try PRN seroquel, or if
   unable to give may try zydis x 1 PRN
   - try to avoid sedation during the day to preserve better sleep/wake
   cycle
   - Taper paxil to 20 mg q day
   - Avoid Haldol and ativan
   # Dysphagia
   Failed video swallow on multiple occasions.  Had NGT but removed
   several times by patient.  Mental status improving and pt tolerated
   applesauce last night.  However, failed repeat swallow study this am.
   - consider PEG tube for short term nutrition as pt has potential to
   improve with time once ICU delirium/mental status improves
   - NPO except meds
   # Hypoxia
   Resolving
 doing well on nasal canula. Patient was intubated from
   [**Date range (1) 14185**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure from pneumonia + heart
   failure.  Reintubated for pacemaker revision.  Was on room air, but
   drifts down to high 80s while sleeping, possibly related to undiagnosed
   OSA.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -aspiration precautions
   -NPO per speech and swallow
   - F/u Is/Os
   -no abx for now (except cefpodoxime for one week as above)
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on
   coumadin.
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue coumadin
   - continue heparin gtt until bridged (INR 1.2)
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic.
   - holding PO lasix given hypotension this am
   - f/u Is/Os
   - continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Normalized.
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely caused by statin (possibly exacerbated by
   concurrent azithromycin therapy).  CK normalized.
   - holding statin for now, but may consider restarting different [**Doctor Last Name **]
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note,
   the patient did report some chest pressure previously, but this has
   since resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given
   hypotension)
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - Strict NPO except meds for now
   - Holding pancreatic enzyme supplementation for now. Will need to
   restart enzyme supplementation once patient has NGT again.

   (see below). Delirium markedly exacerbated by many psychotropics and
   sedatives. D/w geriatrics and appreciated their recommendations.  The
   patient likely had hypoxic injury, ICU delirium, with possible
   underlying neurodegenerative disease. Given possibility of [**Last Name (un) **] Body
   Disease, they recommended not using Haldol or ativan, but instead using
   Seroquel or, if this is not possible, then Zydis. Avoid Haldol because
   of likely underlying disease and arrhythmogenicity/prolonged QT. Also
   taper Paxil because of its anticholinergic properties and exacerbation
   of akathisia. Initial dose of seroquel was very sedating (12.5) so
   halved and standing dose shifted from am to pm.  Of note, we should
   make sure not to score limb movements (restless legs) as agitation.
   - Seroquel to 6.25 mg PO QPM with repeat x 1 if no result within 1 hour
   - if pt requires more sedation overnight may try PRN seroquel, or if
   unable to give may try zydis x 1 PRN
   - try to avoid sedation during the day to preserve better sleep/wake

   - Taper paxil to 20 mg q day
   - Avoid Haldol and Ativan
   - Talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14448**] about pre-admission mental status
   # Dysphagia and dysarthria
   Dysarthria may suggest that dysphagia likely to show little recovery.
   Failed video swallow on multiple occasions.  Had NGT but removed five
   times by patient.  Mental status improving and pt tolerated applesauce
   last night.  However, failed repeat swallow study yesterday. Reluctant
   to place PEG, as not good long-term solution (aspiration risk just as
   high as swallowing), but will talk to electrophysiologist (Dr.

   Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note, the patient
   did report some chest pressure previously, but this has since
   resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history including systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but later attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. The hospital course was complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of VT including one VT arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He is currently euvolemic but may have slightly low intravascular volume given recent hypotension. Monitoring blood pressure and fluid balance is important.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure which responded to small boluses. No tamponade physiology was noted, and the echo showed normal results. The cause of hypotension is likely due to being NPO (nothing by mouth). Continuing to monitor blood pressure and providing small boluses as needed is recommended.

   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest. These issues are now resolved,
   with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. He has pulled
   his NGT five times and we were considering PEG, but he fortunately
   passed speech and swallow this a.m. His mental status continues to
   improve, but while NPO had had some small amount of asymptomatic
   hypotension to systolic pressure in the 80s. This improved with fluids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history of systolic heart failure (EF 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, for which he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placed. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, runs of VT, including one VT arrest. These issues are now resolved, with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. The patient has pulled his nasogastric tube five times and was considering percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), but fortunately passed speech and swallow this morning. His mental status continues to improve. He is euvolemic, perhaps slightly low intravascular volume given recent hypotension. He is currently not on oral fluids or medications due to the absence of a feeding tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, runs of VT, and removal and replacement of a fractured lead. His mental status continues to improve, and he has passed speech and swallow evaluation. The patient is euvolemic, perhaps slightly low intravascular volume given recent hypotension. He has been holding PO lasix, and his blood pressure responded to small boluses. The plan is to continue monitoring his blood pressure, restarting POs, and holding lasix. The patient's ICD dysfunction has been resolved with the replacement of a fractured lead. He will continue on amiodarone, metoprolol, and Coumadin. His anemia is being managed with iron supplementation. The patient will be transferred to a rehabilitation/long-term care facility likely tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of heart failure, pneumonia, and delirium, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical team has decided to attempt percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for feeding due to dysphagia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 80 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 99/55 mmHg to 74/49 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 98% without any respiratory support. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and Ambien, resulting in hives and lightheadedness. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, potassium, and liver enzymes. The patient's serum creatinine, glucose levels, and hemoglobin levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of community-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as worsening respiratory symptoms, increased sputum production, and potential spread of infection.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty in maintaining proper nutrition.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has sustained ventricular tachycardia, which may lead to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
4. Heart Failure (CH"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest. These issues are now resolved,
   with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. He has pulled
   his NGT five times and we were considering PEG, but he fortunately
   passed speech and swallow this a.m. His mental status continues to
   improve, but while NPO had had some small amount of asymptomatic
   hypotension to systolic pressure in the 80s. This improved with fluids.
   He is now ready for rehabilitation.
   Plan
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic, perhaps slightly low
   intravascular given recent hypotension.
   - Holding PO lasix given recent hypotension
   - F/u Is/Os
   - Continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Hypotension
   Low blood pressure yesterday a.m. and then later in the day
 responded
   to small boluses. No tampenade physiology
 normal echo and pulsus of
   10 mmHg. Likely due to being NPO.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - small boluses PRN, rather than maintenance fluids
   - hold lasix
   - BP holding parameters on metoprolol
   - Encourage POs
   # supratheraputic INR:  Also on hep gtt.
   -          INR 3.4 today, unclear why so elevated.  Possibly from poor
   nutrition.
   -          Stop hep gtt
   -          Decrease Coumadin to 1 mg q day
   # VT/VF/AF/
   ICD dysfunction with fractured lead, now successfully replaced for dual
   chamber. Paced continually now. Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during
   which ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Some VT following. Etiology of recent increased ectopy thought to be
   [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in
   setting of amiodarone. Now not a problem. Past-history of AF,
   non-active, but given apical akinesis, should definitely be
   anticoagulated. RV coil was found to be fractured, now removed and
   replaced on [**2141-3-21**].
   - cefpodoxime for one week from [**2141-3-24**]
   - f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   - continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - monitor QTC on EKG (avoid Haldol)
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarted Coumadin
   # Mental Status
   High cognitive ability at baseline and rapidly improving. Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3723**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5758**] thought PEG would be warranted given likely recovery,
   but now does not need this given passing speech and swallow.
   # Dysphagia and dysarthria
   Passed [**2141-3-29**]
   -Pureed (dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids
   - calorie counts
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note, the patient
   did report some chest pressure previously, but this has since
   resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given
   hypotension)
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of an infiltrate, fever, and white blood cell count. 

During the hospital course, the patient experienced high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation, reintubation, and runs of ventricular tachycardia including one arrest. These issues have been resolved with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. The patient has also pulled out his nasogastric tube five times and was considering percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, but fortunately passed the swallow evaluation this morning. 

The patient's mental status continues to improve, but while NPO, he had some small amount of asymptomatic hypotension to systolic pressure in the 80s. This improved with fluids. The patient is now ready for rehabilitation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest. These issues are now resolved,
   with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. He has pulled
   his NGT five times and we were considering PEG, but he fortunately
   passed speech and swallow this a.m. His mental status continues to
   improve, but while NPO had had some small amount of asymptomatic
   hypotension to systolic pressure in the 80s. This improved with fluids.
   He is now ready for rehabilitation.
   Plan
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic, perhaps slightly low
   intravascular given recent hypotension.
   - Holding PO lasix given recent hypotension
   - F/u Is/Os
   - Continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**] with holding parameters
   # Hypotension
   Low blood pressure yesterday a.m. and then later in the day
 responded
   to small boluses. No tampenade physiology
 normal echo and pulsus of
   10 mmHg. Likely due to being NPO.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - small boluses PRN, rather than maintenance fluids
   - hold lasix
   - BP holding parameters on metoprolol
   - Encourage POs
   # supratheraputic INR:  Also on hep gtt.  [**Month (only) 51**] be from Amiodarone
   interaction.  Pt also received 3 mg a day for 2 days which is above
   baseline regimen of 2 mg a day.
   -          INR 3.4 today, unclear why so elevated.  Possibly from poor
   nutrition.
   -          Stop hep gtt
   -          Decrease Coumadin to 2 mg q day
   # VT/VF/AF/
   ICD dysfunction with fractured lead, now successfully replaced for dual
   chamber. Paced continually now. Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during
   which ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Some VT following. Etiology of recent increased ectopy thought to be
   [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in
   setting of amiodarone. Now not a problem. Past-history of AF,
   non-active, but given apical akinesis, should definitely be
   anticoagulated. RV coil was found to be fractured, now removed and
   replaced on [**2141-3-21**].
   - clarify length of cefpodoxime (for one week from [**2141-3-24**] vs life?)
   - f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   - continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - monitor QTC on EKG (avoid Haldol)
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarted Coumadin
   # Mental Status
   High cognitive ability at baseline and rapidly improving. Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3723**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5758**] thought PEG would be warranted given likely recovery,
   but now does not need this given passing speech and swallow.
   # Dysphagia and dysarthria
   Passed [**2141-3-29**] swallow
   -Pureed (dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids
   - calorie counts
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note, the patient
   did report some chest pressure previously, but this has since
   resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given
   hypotension)
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - restarted diet
   - restart pancreatic enzyme supplementation

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest. These issues are now resolved,
   with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. He has pulled
   his NGT five times and we were considering PEG, but he fortunately
   passed speech and swallow this a.m. His mental status continues to
   improve, but while NPO had had some small amount of asymptomatic
   hypotension to systolic pressure in the 80s. This improved with fluids.
   He is now ready for rehabilitation.
   Plan
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic, perhaps slightly low
   intravascular given recent hypotension.
   - Holding PO lasix given recent hypotension
   - F/u Is/Os
   - Continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**] with holding parameters
   # Hypotension
   Low blood pressure yesterday a.m. and then later in the day
 responded
   to small boluses. No tampenade physiology
 normal echo and pulsus of
   10 mmHg. Likely due to being NPO.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - small boluses PRN, rather than maintenance fluids
   - hold lasix
   - BP holding parameters on metoprolol
   - Encourage POs
   # supratheraputic INR:  Also on hep gtt.  [**Month (only) 51**] be from Amiodarone
   interaction.  Pt also received 3 mg a day for 2 days which is above
   baseline regimen of 2 mg a day.
   -          INR 3.4 today, unclear why so elevated.  Possibly from poor
   nutrition.
   -          Stop hep gtt
   -          Decrease Coumadin to 2 mg q day
   # VT/VF/AF/
   ICD dysfunction with fractured lead, now successfully replaced for dual
   chamber. Paced continually now. Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during
   which ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Some VT following. Etiology of recent increased ectopy thought to be
   [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in
   setting of amiodarone. Now not a problem. Past-history of AF,
   non-active, but given apical akinesis, should definitely be
   anticoagulated. RV coil was found to be fractured, now removed and
   replaced on [**2141-3-21**].
   - clarify length of cefpodoxime (for one week from [**2141-3-24**] vs life?)
   - f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   - continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - monitor QTC on EKG (avoid Haldol)
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarted Coumadin
   # Mental Status
   High cognitive ability at baseline and rapidly improving. Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3723**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5758**] thought PEG would be warranted given likely recovery,
   but now does not need this given passing speech and swallow.
   # Dysphagia and dysarthria
   Passed [**2141-3-29**] swallow
   -Pureed (dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids
   - calorie counts
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note, the patient
   did report some chest pressure previously, but this has since resolved.
    MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given
   hypotension)
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - restarted diet
   - restart pancreatic enzyme supplementation

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a significant past medical history including systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but later attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. 

During his hospital course, the patient experienced high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, runs of VT including one VT arrest. These issues are now resolved with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. 

The patient has also pulled his nasogastric tube five times and was considering percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), but fortunately passed a swallow evaluation this morning. The patient's mental status continues to improve, but while NPO (nothing by mouth) he had some small amount of asymptomatic hypotension to systolic pressure in the 80s. This improved with fluids. 

The patient is now ready for rehabilitation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure yesterday morning and then later in the day responded to small boluses. No tamponade physiology was noted"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**26**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but
   subsequently attributed to pneumonia in setting of infiltrate, fever,
   white count. Hospital course complicated by high fevers, ICD
   malfunction, VT/VF arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation,
   and runs of VT, including one VT arrest. These issues are now resolved,
   with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. He has pulled
   his NGT five times and we were considering PEG, but he fortunately
   passed speech and swallow this a.m. His mental status continues to
   improve, but while NPO had had some small amount of asymptomatic
   hypotension to systolic pressure in the 80s. This improved with fluids.
   He is now ready for rehabilitation.
   Plan
   # Chronic systolic heart failure
   Patient with EF 20-25%. Currently euvolemic, perhaps slightly low
   intravascular given recent hypotension.
   - Holding PO lasix given recent hypotension
   - F/u Is/Os
   - Continue metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**] with holding parameters
   # Hypotension
   Low blood pressure yesterday a.m. and then later in the day
 responded
   to small boluses. No tampenade physiology
 normal echo and pulsus of
   10 mmHg. Likely due to being NPO.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - small boluses PRN, rather than maintenance fluids
   - hold lasix
   - BP holding parameters on metoprolol
   - Encourage POs
   # supratheraputic INR:  Also on hep gtt.  [**Month (only) 51**] be from Amiodarone
   interaction.  Pt also received 3 mg a day for 2 days which is above
   baseline regimen of 2 mg a day.
   -          INR 3.4 today, unclear why so elevated.  Possibly from poor
   nutrition.
   -          Stop hep gtt
   -          Decrease Coumadin to 2 mg q day
   # VT/VF/AF/
   ICD dysfunction with fractured lead, now successfully replaced for dual
   chamber. Paced continually now. Patient had VT/VF arrest on [**3-12**] during
   which ICD failed to defibrillate him and he required external therapy.
   Some VT following. Etiology of recent increased ectopy thought to be
   [**1-24**] fast/short sequences, pacer settings, and QT prolongation in
   setting of amiodarone. Now not a problem. Past-history of AF,
   non-active, but given apical akinesis, should definitely be
   anticoagulated. RV coil was found to be fractured, now removed and
   replaced on [**2141-3-21**].
   - clarify length of cefpodoxime (for one week from [**2141-3-24**] vs life?)
   - f/u EP recs, appreciate their input
   - continue current amiodarone dose 200mg daily,  metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - monitor QTC on EKG (avoid Haldol)
   - metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restarted Coumadin
   # Mental Status
   High cognitive ability at baseline and rapidly improving. Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3723**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5758**] thought PEG would be warranted given likely recovery,
   but now does not need this given passing speech and swallow.
   # Dysphagia and dysarthria
   Passed [**2141-3-29**] swallow
   -Pureed (dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids
   - calorie counts
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2126**]. Of note, the patient
   did report some chest pressure previously, but this has since
   resolved.  MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol (with holding parameters given
   hypotension)
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Hct gradually trending down. No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   # S/p Whipple: Was on tube feeds and did trial of PO as mental status
   improving.  However, there was concern for aspiration so speech and
   swallow consulted
   - restarted diet
   - restart pancreatic enzyme supplementation

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history significant for systolic heart failure, myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure exacerbation but subsequently attributed to pneumonia in the setting of infiltrate, fever, and white count. The hospital course has been complicated by high fevers, ICD malfunction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest requiring defibrillation and reintubation, and runs of ventricular tachycardia including one ventricular tachycardia arrest. These issues are now resolved, with pacer wire replacement and no fevers for some time. The patient has pulled his nasogastric tube five times and was considering percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), but fortunately passed speech and swallow this morning. His mental status continues to improve, but while NPO he had some small amount of asymptomatic hypotension to systolic pressure in the 80s. This improved with fluids. He is now ready for rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He is currently euvolemic, perhaps slightly low intr"
