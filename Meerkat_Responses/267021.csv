136799.0,267021,2157-08-24 07:04:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina
   bifida, recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed
   urosepsis in the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and now
   presents with hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to
   maintain O2 sat >90%.
   24 Hour Events:
   Once on the floor, patient was started in CPAP.  She wore it for
   several hours and her O2 sats were 98-100%.  However, she did not
   tolerate the mask all night and went back on facemask to keep 02 sats
   up.  She received a 500 ml bolus to see if her tachycardia would
   respond but she continued to be tachy in 120s.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and now presents
   with hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2
   sat >90%.
   Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:  Patient has failure of oxygenation and
   ventilation. Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long
   differential diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c.
   pneumoniae, Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. ARDS (of unknown
   etiology) vs. inhalational injury vs. pulmonary hemorrhage.
   -For oxygenation, we will continue on supplemental oxygen and try Bipap
   as tolerated.
   -For ventilation, we will use bipap as tolerated.
   -Expand antibiotic coverage to Vanco/Zosyn/Azithromycin for atypical
   pneumonia with concerning lung exam.
   -To rule out ARDS,
   -CXR in am
   -Sputum culture
   -check Legionella urinary anitgen, mycoplasma titres, serum crypto
   antigen
   -F/U ID recs
   -agressive nebs with albuterol/atrovent and acetylcystine
   -pulmonary toilet
   -If patient does not respond to antibiotics/CPAP in 48 hours, consider
   steroids for possible BOOP, vs. diagnostic bronchoscopy.
   # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to intravascular depletion
   -Fluid bolus 500 NS
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Hematocrit has trended down since admission (35 to 26).  Has
   remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active bleeding.
   Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but continued drop is
   concerning for possible pumonary hemorrhage (though distribution of
   opacities makes this less likely).
    -check HCT in AM
   -guaiac stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation. Currently on senna, polyethelene glycol, milk of magnesia
   and lactulose without recent BM.
   -Fleets Enema in AM
   -monitor abdominal exam, if worsening consider KUB.
   #.  Pain control
   - Continue lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine 15mg PRN.
   - Continue MS Contin 30 q8h standing

","The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent UTIs, and a suprapubic catheter. She was previously treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU last week but became unstable on the floor and now presents with hypoxia, tachypnea, and requires a non-rebreather to maintain O2 sat >90%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6째C (97.9째F), current temperature of 35.9째C (96.7째F), heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 118/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Her respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula with CPAP mode, delivering oxygen at a flow rate of 95%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 76 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 117, and a ventilation rate of 3.9 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally, expiratory wheeze, and pops, with no cyanosis. The abdomen is mildly distended, mildly tender, and hard but not tight. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 15.7 K/uL, Hct of 24%, Plt of 254 K/uL, Cr of 0.3 mg/dL, TCO2 of 38, Glucose of 107 mg/dL, and other lab values including lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The assessment and plan include addressing respiratory distress with oxygenation and ventilation support, expanding antibiotic coverage for atypical pneumonia, ruling out ARDS, and considering diagnostic bronchoscopy if the patient does not respond to antibiotics/CPAP within 48 hours. The tachycardia is persistent and may be related to intravascular depletion, so fluid resuscitation is planned. Anemia is noted with a decreasing hematocrit, which may be due to hemodilution or possible pulmonary hemorrhage. Abdominal pain and constipation are also present, and pain control measures are continued. Additionally, wound care for the sacral decub wound, GERD management, tobacco use support, and nutritional support are addressed."

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She was previously treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU and then became unstable on the floor. She now presents with hypoxia, tachypnea, and requires a non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient has been started on CPAP, but has low tolerance for it. She is also experiencing persistent tachycardia, anemia, abdominal pain/constipation, and has a longstanding sacral decub wound. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has hypoxia and tachypnea, indicating respiratory distress. This could be due to atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on CPAP, which improved ventilation overnight but has low tolerance. It is recommended to continue facemask and CPAP as tolerated, and further investigations such as a chest X-ray (CXR) and sputum culture should be done. Considering the bilateral upper lobe distribution, it is less likely to be aspiration pneumonia. 

2. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia since admission. It was initially thought to be due to sepsis, but now it is suspected to be related to intravascular depletion. A fluid bolus of 500"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She was previously treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU but became unstable on the floor and is now presenting with hypoxia, tachypnea, and requiring a non-rebreather mask to maintain O2 saturation above 90%. The patient has a history of tobacco use and GERD.

24-hour events:
- The patient was started on CPAP but did not tolerate it all night and went back to using a facemask to maintain O2 saturation.
- A 500 ml bolus was given to address tachycardia, but the patient continued to be tachycardic at 120 beats per minute.
- A PICC line was inserted.
- Non-invasive ventilation was started at 12:19 AM and stopped at 4:03 AM.
- A urine culture was obtained at 4:39 AM.
- Allergies include penicillins, and the last dose of antibiotics (ceftriaxone) was given at 11:31 PM on 08/23.

Vital Signs:
- Temperature (Tmax): 36.6째C (97.9째F), current temperature (Tcurrent): 35.9째C (96.7째F)

   24 Hour Events:
   Once on the floor, patient was started in CPAP.  She wore it for
   several hours and her O2 sats were 98-100%.  However, she did not
   tolerate the mask all night and went back on facemask to keep 02 sats
   up.  She received a 500 ml bolus to see if her tachycardia would

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and now presents
   with hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2
   sat >90%.
   Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient has failure of oxygenation and
   ventilation. Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long
   differential diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c.
   pneumoniae, Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. inhalational injury vs.
   pulmonary hemorrhage vs. BOOP.  She meets some [**Month/Year (2) 509**] criteria (pa02/Fio2
   <200, bilateral patchy infiltrates, acute onset) so [**Month/Year (2) 509**] cannot be
   ruled out.  However,  her lung exam is impressive and often [**Month/Year (2) 509**] lung
   exams are more benign.
   -For oxygenation, we will continue on supplemental oxygen and try Bipap
   as tolerated.
   -For ventilation, we will use bipap as tolerated.
   -Expand antibiotic coverage to Vanco/Zosyn/Azithromycin for atypical
   pneumonia with concerning lung exam.
   -At this point, we will not treat prophylactically for PCP as she is
   clinically stable.   We will, however try to consent the patient for an
   HIV test because this would potentially change our differential and
   treatment.
   -To rule out [**Last Name (LF) 509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] get TTE and BNP to evaluate pulmonary wedge
   pressure.
   -CXR in am
   -LDH
   -We would like to get a sputum culture but she is producing mouth
   secretions and not much sputum
   -Given the long differential diagnosis and concerning CT chest,
   diagnostic bronchoscopy would likely narrow our differential
   diagnosis.  The patient would need to be intubated and sedated for this
   procedure and may need someone to make decisions for her while she is
   intubated.  Currently, she does not have a health care POA and this
   will need to be sorted out before we perform a bronchoscopy.
   -check Legionella urinary anitgen, mycoplasma titres, serum crypto
   antigen
   -F/U ID recs
   -agressive nebs with albuterol/atrovent and acetylcystine
   -pulmonary toilet
   # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to intravascular depletion
   -Fluid bolus 500 NS
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Hematocrit has trended down since admission (35 to 26).  Has
   remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active bleeding.
   Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but continued drop is
   concerning for possible pumonary hemorrhage (though distribution of
   opacities makes this less likely).
    -check HCT in AM
   -guaiac stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation. Currently on senna, polyethelene glycol, milk of magnesia
   and lactulose without recent BM.
   -Fleets Enema in AM
   -monitor abdominal exam, if worsening consider KUB.
   #Suprapubic Catheter and chronic UTIs
   -U/A is worsening, but difficult to interpret in the setting of chronic
   catheter.  Will c/s ID and f/u cultures
   -if patient becomes acutely worse, or signs of sepsis, we will treat
   for VRE with linezolid (though right now we think it is colonization
   and not infection
   #.  Pain control
   - Continue lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine 15mg PRN.
   - Continue MS Contin 30 q8h standing
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer, longstanding.
   -follow wound care recs
   -will make sure this is not the source of her infection
   .
   # GERD - Continue omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 7**]

   Assessment and Plan
   yof progressive pulmonary infiltrates
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- ventilatory failure (possible chronic
   component), with radiographic evidence for progression of diffuse
   pulmonary infiltrates.  Poor tolerance of non-invasive ventilation.
   Low threshold for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- diffuse, bilateral, upper lung field
   predominate.  Unclear etiology, but concerns include infection
   (including atypical organisms), opportunistic infection (although not
   known to be immunocomporomised),  drug-induced, immune mediated,
   vasculitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, hemorrhage, or ARDS.  Would proceed
   with bronchoscopy (will require intubation) at least for procedure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics, including atypical coverage.
   ALKALOSIS -- rising HCO3 since [**2157-8-15**], may reflect worsening
   ventilation.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of contraction alkalosis.
   ANASARCA -- unclear etiology.  Check BNP.  Check cardiac echo to assess
   LV function, RV funciton, valvular heart disease.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  No evidence for pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  Monitor uo, BUN, creat.
   UTI -- chronic.  Suprapubic catheter.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- poor po intake due to resp. compromise.
   ANEMIA -- No obvious clinical blood loss. Possible alveolar hemorrhage.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has been experiencing progressive pulmonary infiltrates, poor tolerance of non-invasive ventilation, and requires mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about the etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates, including infection, drug-induced, immune-mediated, vasculitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, hemorrhage, or ARDS. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis and anasarca, with unclear etiology. Renal function is preserved, but there is a chronic UTI and poor oral intake due to respiratory compromise. Anemia is also present.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, atelectasis, infection (including hospital-acquired infections), and further deterioration of respiratory function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   yof progressive pulmonary infiltrates
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- ventilatory failure (possible chronic
   component), with radiographic evidence for progression of diffuse
   pulmonary infiltrates.  Poor tolerance of non-invasive ventilation.
   Low threshold for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- diffuse, bilateral, upper lung field
   predominate.  Unclear etiology, but concerns include infection
   (including atypical organisms), opportunistic infection (although not
   known to be immunocomporomised),  drug-induced, immune mediated,
   vasculitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, hemorrhage, or ARDS.  Would proceed
   with bronchoscopy (will require intubation) at least for procedure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics, including atypical coverage.
   ALKALOSIS -- rising HCO3 since [**2157-8-15**], may reflect worsening
   ventilation.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of contraction alkalosis.
   ANASARCA -- unclear etiology.  Check BNP.  Check cardiac echo to assess
   LV function, RV funciton, valvular heart disease.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  No evidence for pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  Monitor uo, BUN, creat.
   UTI -- chronic.  Suprapubic catheter.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- poor po intake due to resp. compromise.
   ANEMIA -- No obvious clinical blood loss. Possible alveolar hemorrhage.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone several interventions, including the placement of a PICC line and non-invasive ventilation. The patient tolerated non-invasive ventilation only intermittently and briefly due to anxiety. They received N-acetyl-cysteine via nebs to promote pulmonary toilet. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. They are receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and CPAP mode ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 95%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.29. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese, and no signs of conjunctival pallor or edema. The cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. The respiratory examination shows bilateral crackles without wheezing. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. The extremities are warm and well-perfused. The neurologic examination is within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and now presents
   with hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2
   sat >90%.
   Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   now intubated.  This is likely secondary to her pulmonary process.
   Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long differential
   diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c. pneumoniae,
   Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. inhalational injury vs. pulmonary
   hemorrhage vs. BOOP vs. PE.  Bronchoscopy yesterday was unrevealing,
   but ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage.  She meets some ARDS criteria
   (pa02/Fio2 <200, bilateral patchy infiltrates, acute onset) but also
   has evidence of Right heart strain (BNP >5000, TTE with hyperdynamic
   LV) and more likely explanation.
   -Try to wean FiO2 to .40 and PEEP to 5.  Continue to monitor ABGs
   -Metabolic acidosis likely increasing her need for ventilatory support,
   so will try to keep K>4.5, change IVF.
   -RSBI and SBT this afternoon vs. tomorrow morning
   -Continue antibiotic coverage with Vanc, cefepime and flagyl.  Will add
   azithromycin for atypical coverage.
   -Follow up cultures, HIV test
   -add galactomanin onto BAL
   -peripheral diff added on given eosinophilia seen on BAL.  In
   eosinophilic pna, typically >20% on BAL and not elevated on smear.
   -At this point, we will not treat prophylactically for PCP as she is
   clinically stable.
   -CXR in am
   -F/U ID recs
   -patient noted to be wheezing on exam, will find out if she has an
   asthma history.
   # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  Unlikely to be related to intravascular depletion.
   Patient has a history of PE, which cannot be ruled out.
    -LENIs
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Hematocrit has trended down since admission (35 to 26).  Has
   remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active bleeding.
   Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but continued drop is
   concerning for other source, though pulmonary hemorrhage is now
   unlikely given Bal results.
    -check HCT in PM
   -guaiac stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation.
   -senna, , milk of magnesia and lactulose  down NG.  If no BM today,
   enema tomorrow.
   #Suprapubic Catheter and chronic UTIs
   -U/A is worsening, but difficult to interpret in the setting of chronic
   catheter.  Will c/s ID and f/u cultures
   -if patient [**Last Name (un) 1132**] signs of  sepsis, we will treat for VRE with
   linezolid (though right now we think it is colonization and not
   infection
   #.  Pain control : Patient now sedated.
    - D/C lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine 15mg PRN.
   - D/C MS Contin 30 q8h standing
   # GERD - Continue omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Tobacco use - Continue nicotine patch
   .
   # FEN:  NPO tonight with CPAP.  Once CPAP off, can have regular diet.
   # Access: PICC
   -will go down to IR for PICC replacement (needs a double lumen for
   access)

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and now presents
   with hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2
   sat >90%.
   Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient has failure of oxygenation and
   ventilation. Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long
   differential diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c.
   pneumoniae, Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. inhalational injury vs.
   pulmonary hemorrhage vs. BOOP.  She meets some [**Month/Year (2) 509**] criteria (pa02/Fio2
   <200, bilateral patchy infiltrates, acute onset) so [**Month/Year (2) 509**] cannot be
   ruled out.  However,  her lung exam is impressive and often [**Month/Year (2) 509**] lung
   exams are more benign.
   -For oxygenation, we will continue on supplemental oxygen and try Bipap
   as tolerated.
   -For ventilation, we will use bipap as tolerated.
   -Expand antibiotic coverage to Vanco/Zosyn/Azithromycin for atypical
   pneumonia with concerning lung exam.
   -At this point, we will not treat prophylactically for PCP as she is
   clinically stable.   We will, however try to consent the patient for an
   HIV test because this would potentially change our differential and
   treatment.
   -To rule out [**Last Name (LF) 509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] get TTE and BNP to evaluate pulmonary wedge
   pressure.
   -CXR in am
   -LDH
   -We would like to get a sputum culture but she is producing mouth
   secretions and not much sputum
   -Given the long differential diagnosis and concerning CT chest,
   diagnostic bronchoscopy would likely narrow our differential
   diagnosis.  The patient would need to be intubated and sedated for this
   procedure and may need someone to make decisions for her while she is
   intubated.  Currently, she does not have a health care POA and this
   will need to be sorted out before we perform a bronchoscopy.
   -check Legionella urinary anitgen, mycoplasma titres, serum crypto
   antigen
   -F/U ID recs
   -agressive nebs with albuterol/atrovent and acetylcystine
   -pulmonary toilet
   # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to intravascular depletion
   -Fluid bolus 500 NS
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Hematocrit has trended down since admission (35 to 26).  Has
   remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active bleeding.
   Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but continued drop is
   concerning for possible pumonary hemorrhage (though distribution of
   opacities makes this less likely).
    -check HCT in AM
   -guaiac stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation. Currently on senna, polyethelene glycol, milk of magnesia
   and lactulose without recent BM.
   -Fleets Enema in AM
   -monitor abdominal exam, if worsening consider KUB.
   #Suprapubic Catheter and chronic UTIs
   -U/A is worsening, but difficult to interpret in the setting of chronic
   catheter.  Will c/s ID and f/u cultures
   -if patient becomes acutely worse, or signs of sepsis, we will treat
   for VRE with linezolid (though right now we think it is colonization
   and not infection
   #.  Pain control
   - Continue lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine 15mg PRN.
   - Continue MS Contin 30 q8h standing
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer, longstanding.
   -follow wound care recs
   -will make sure this is not the source of her infection
   .
   # GERD - Continue omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Tobacco use - Continue nicotine patch
   .
   # FEN:  NPO tonight with CPAP.  Once CPAP off, can have regular diet.

   pneumonia/pneumonitis vs. ARS.  Continue mechanical venitator support.
   Monitor ABG.  Hope to work towards SBT, but anticipate continued need

   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1129**].  Possible infection (CAP,
   opportunistic infectoin). [**Month (only) 51**] be component of pulmonary edema (ARDS vs.
   cardiogenic).  Eosinophils of only 4%, not consistent with acute
   eosinophilic pneumonia, but may be chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (but
   no history).  Consider ABPA.  Continue empirical antimicrobials,
   including atypical coverage.  Await BAL cultures.  with H/o PE, will
   check LE NIVS to exclude DVT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus. persistent.  ? componoent of medication
   withdrawal (opiates).  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- trial of net negative balance to determine whether component
   of pulmonary edema.
   UTI -- chronic suprapubic catheter
   IV ACCESS -- transition PICC from single lumen to double lumen.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has been receiving bronchodilators and antibiotics. They are currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation. The patient's arterial line was started on 08/25/2157 at 12:10 AM. 

Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse pneumonia: The patient has diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, indicating a possible infection such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or opportunistic infection. Further investigation is needed, including BAL cultures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to the diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, which may be due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia, possibly related to medication withdrawal (opiates).
4. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be monitored closely to determine if there is pulmonary edema.
5. UTI: The patient has a chronic suprapubic catheter, increasing the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI).
6. IV access: The patient's IV access is being transitioned from a single-lumen PICC line to a double-lumen PICC line.

Please note that this summary and list of potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm these complications and guide appropriate treatment."

   Diffuse pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates -->
   pneumonia/pneumonitis vs. ARS.  Continue mechanical venitator support.
   Monitor ABG.  Hope to work towards SBT, but anticipate continued need
   for mechanical ventilation.  Lung protective strategy.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1129**].  Possible infection (CAP,
   opportunistic infectoin). [**Month (only) 51**] be component of pulmonary edema (ARDS vs.
   cardiogenic).  Eosinophils of only 4%, not consistent with acute
   eosinophilic pneumonia, but may be chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (but
   no history).  Consider ABPA.  Continue empirical antimicrobials,
   including atypical coverage.  Await BAL cultures.  with H/o PE, will
   check LE NIVS to exclude DVT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus. persistent.  ? componoent of medication
   withdrawal (opiates).  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- trial of net negative balance to determine whether component
   of pulmonary edema.
   UTI -- chronic suprapubic catheter
   IV ACCESS -- transition PICC from single lumen to double lumen.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and came with  with
   hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2 sat
   >90%.  Then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
    Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   now intubated.  This is likely secondary to her pulmonary process.
   Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long differential
   diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c. pneumoniae,
   Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. inhalational injury vs. pulmonary
   hemorrhage vs. BOOP vs. PE.  Bronchoscopy yesterday was unrevealing,
   but ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage.  She meets some ARDS criteria
   (pa02/Fio2 <200, bilateral patchy infiltrates, acute onset) but also
   has evidence of Right heart strain (BNP >5000, TTE with hyperdynamic
   LV) and more likely explanation.
   -Try to wean FiO2 to .40 and PEEP to 5.  Continue to monitor ABGs
   -Metabolic acidosis likely increasing her need for ventilatory support,
   so will try to keep K>4.5, change IVF.
   -RSBI and SBT this afternoon vs. tomorrow morning
   -Continue antibiotic coverage with Vanc, cefepime and flagyl.  Will add
   azithromycin for atypical coverage.
   -Follow up cultures, HIV test
   -add galactomanin onto BAL
   -peripheral diff added on given eosinophilia seen on BAL.  In
   eosinophilic pna, typically >20% on BAL and not elevated on smear.
   -At this point, we will not treat prophylactically for PCP as she is
   clinically stable.
   -CXR in am
   -F/U ID recs
   -patient noted to be wheezing on exam, will find out if she has an
   asthma history.
   # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  Unlikely to be related to intravascular depletion.
   Patient has a history of PE, which cannot be ruled out.
    -LENIs
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Hematocrit has trended down since admission (35 to 26).  Has
   remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active bleeding.
   Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but continued drop is
   concerning for other source, though pulmonary hemorrhage is now
   unlikely given Bal results.
    -check HCT in PM
   -guaiac stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent UTIs, and a suprapubic catheter. She was admitted to the ICU last week for presumed urosepsis and became unstable on the floor. She presented with hypoxia, tachypnea, and required a non-rebreather to maintain O2 sat >90%. She was then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a long differential diagnosis including atypical pneumonia, inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and pulmonary embolism (PE). A bronchoscopy was performed yesterday and ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage. She meets some criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but also has evidence of right heart strain. 

Plan:
1. Try to wean FiO2 to 0.40 and PEEP to 5. Continue to monitor ABGs.
2. Metabolic acidosis likely increasing her need for ventilatory support, so will try to keep K > 4.5, change IVF.
3. RSBI and SBT this afternoon vs. tomorrow morning.
4. Continue antibiotic coverage with Vanc, cefepime, and flagyl. Will add azithromycin for atypical coverage.
5. Follow-up cultures, HIV test.
6. Add galactomannan onto BAL.
7. Peripheral diff added on given"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and came with  with
   hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2 sat
   >90%.  Then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
    Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   now intubated.  This is likely secondary to her pulmonary process.
   Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long differential
   diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c. pneumoniae,
   Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. inhalational injury vs. pulmonary
   hemorrhage vs. BOOP vs. PE vs.  ARDS.  Bronchoscopy was unrevealing,
   but ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage.  She meets some ARDS criteria
   (pa02/Fio2 <200, bilateral patchy infiltrates, acute onset) but also
   has evidence of Right heart strain (BNP >5000, TTE with hyperdynamic
   LV) and more likely explanation.
   -continue intubation.  Daily SBTs, RSBIs, sedation holidays.
   -trying to keep K>4.5, to reverese her metabolic acidosis which further
   increases her respiratory hypercarbia.
   -Continue antibiotic coverage with Vanc, cefepime and azithromycin for
   atypical coverage.  D/C Flagyl as aspiration is an unlikely cause of
   her current presentaiton.  Maybe continue to peel off antibiotics if
   she does not respond.  Infectious cause is still likely, but
   non-infectious cause definitely possible.
   -add on chlamydia pneumoniae serologies.
   -HIV negative, so unlikely PCP.

    -F/U ID recs
    # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  Unlikely to be related to intravascular depletion.
   Patient has a history of PE, which cannot be ruled out.
    -LENIs negative, unlikely PE.
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Has remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active
   bleeding. Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but drop is
   concerning for other source, though pulmonary hemorrhage is now
   unlikely given Bal results.
     -check HCT in PM

   constipation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She was previously treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU last week. She presented with hypoxia, tachypnea, and required a non-rebreather to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. She was then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral patchy infiltrates on CT scan, which could indicate atypical pneumonia, inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), pulmonary embolism (PE), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, bronchoscopy ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient meets some criteria for ARDS but also has evidence of right heart strain.

Plan:
- Continue intubation and daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) and respiratory system assessments (RSBIs).
- Keep potassium levels above 4.5 to reverse metabolic acidosis and reduce respiratory hypercarbia.
- Continue antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for atypical coverage. Discontinue Flagyl as aspiration is an unlikely cause.
- Add chlamydia pneumoniae serologies.
- Follow up with infectious disease recommendations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and came with  with
   hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2 sat
   >90%.  Then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
    Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   now intubated.  This is likely secondary to her pulmonary process.
   Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long differential
   diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c. pneumoniae,
   Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. inhalational injury vs. pulmonary
   hemorrhage vs. BOOP vs. PE vs.  ARDS.  Bronchoscopy was unrevealing,
   but ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage.  She meets some ARDS criteria
   (pa02/Fio2 <200, bilateral patchy infiltrates, acute onset) but also
   has evidence of Right heart strain (BNP >5000, TTE with hyperdynamic
   LV) and more likely explanation.
   -continue intubation.  Daily SBTs, RSBIs, sedation holidays.
   -trying to keep K>4.5, to reverese her metabolic acidosis which further
   increases her respiratory hypercarbia.
   -Continue antibiotic coverage with Vanc, cefepime and azithromycin for
   atypical coverage.  D/C Flagyl as aspiration is an unlikely cause of
   her current presentaiton.  Maybe continue to peel off antibiotics if
   she does not respond.  Infectious cause is still likely, but
   non-infectious cause definitely possible.
   -add on chlamydia pneumoniae serologies.
   -HIV negative, so unlikely PCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She was previously treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU last week and became unstable on the floor. She presented with hypoxia, tachypnea, and required a non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. She was subsequently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with a pulmonary process, likely secondary to her underlying pulmonary condition. The differential diagnosis includes atypical pneumonia, inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bronchoscopy was unrevealing, ruling out pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient meets some criteria for ARDS but also shows evidence of right heart strain. The most likely explanation for her presentation is a non-infectious cause.

Plan:
1. Continue intubation and daily sedation holidays.
2. Keep potassium levels above 4.5 to reverse metabolic acidosis and reduce respiratory hypercarbia.
3. Continue antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for atypical coverage. Discontinue Flagyl as aspiration is unlikely.
4. Add on Chlamydia pneumoniae serologies.

She was treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU last week and became unstable on the floor. The patient presents with hypoxia, tachypnea, and requires a non-rebreather to maintain O2 saturation above 90%. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to her pulmonary process. There is a long differential diagnosis including atypical pneumonia, inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient meets some criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but also shows evidence of right heart strain. Continuous monitoring of ABGs, FiO2, and PEEP is recommended. A respiratory support plan should be formulated based on the patient's response to weaning FiO2 to 0.40 and PEEP to 5.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely increasing her need for ventilatory support. It is important to keep potassium levels above 4.5 and adjust IV fluids accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and came with  with
   hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2 sat
   >90%.  Then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
    Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   now intubated.  This is likely secondary to her pulmonary process.
   Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long differential
   diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c. pneumoniae,
   Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. inhalational injury vs. pulmonary
   hemorrhage vs. BOOP vs. PE.  Bronchoscopy yesterday was unrevealing,
   but ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage.  She meets some ARDS criteria
   (pa02/Fio2 <200, bilateral patchy infiltrates, acute onset) but also
   has evidence of Right heart strain (BNP >5000, TTE with hyperdynamic
   LV) and more likely explanation.
   -Try to wean FiO2 to .40 and PEEP to 5.  Continue to monitor ABGs
   -Metabolic acidosis likely increasing her need for ventilatory support,
   so will try to keep K>4.5, change IVF.
   -RSBI and SBT this afternoon vs. tomorrow morning
   -Continue antibiotic coverage with Vanc, cefepime and flagyl.  Will add
   azithromycin for atypical coverage.
   -Follow up cultures, HIV test
   -add galactomanin onto BAL
   -peripheral diff added on given eosinophilia seen on BAL.  In
   eosinophilic pna, typically >20% on BAL and not elevated on smear.
   -At this point, we will not treat prophylactically for PCP as she is
   clinically stable.
   -CXR in am
   -F/U ID recs
   -patient noted to be wheezing on exam, will find out if she has an
   asthma history.
   # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  Unlikely to be related to intravascular depletion.
   Patient has a history of PE, which cannot be ruled out.
    -LENIs
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Hematocrit has trended down since admission (35 to 26).  Has
   remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active bleeding.
   Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but continued drop is
   concerning for other source, though pulmonary hemorrhage is now
   unlikely given Bal results.
    -check HCT in PM
   -guaiac stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation.
   -senna, , milk of magnesia and lactulose  down NG.  If no BM today,
   enema tomorrow.
   #Suprapubic Catheter and chronic UTIs
   -U/A is worsening, but difficult to interpret in the setting of chronic
   catheter.  Will c/s ID and f/u cultures
   -if patient [**Last Name (un) 1132**] signs of  sepsis, we will treat for VRE with
   linezolid (though right now we think it is colonization and not
   infection
   #.  Pain control : Patient now sedated.
    - D/C lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine 15mg PRN.
   - D/C MS Contin 30 q8h standing
   # GERD - Continue omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Tobacco use - Continue nicotine patch
   .
   # FEN:  NPO tonight with CPAP.  Once CPAP off, can have regular diet.
   # Access: PICC
   -will go down to IR for PICC replacement (needs a double lumen for
   access)
   .
   # PPx:  Heparin SC, omeprazole, bowel regimen.
   .
   # Code:  Full code.  Cousin [**Name (NI) 1035**] is her HCP
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU until above resolved

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She was treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU last week but became unstable on the floor and required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has a long differential diagnosis for her pulmonary process, including atypical pneumonia, inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- She meets some acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) criteria but also has evidence of right heart strain. The most likely explanation for her condition is not yet determined.
- The patient's current plan includes trying to wean FiO2 to 0.40 and PEEP to 5, continuing to monitor arterial blood gases (ABGs), attempting to keep potassium levels above 4.5, changing intravenous fluids (IVF), performing respiratory system compliance and incentive spirometry (RSBI) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this afternoon or tomorrow morning, continuing antibiotic coverage, adding azithromycin for atypical coverage, following up with cultures and HIV test, adding galactomannan onto bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and checking peripheral differential.
- The patient also has persistent tachycardia since admission, which may be related to sepsis"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 59-year-old individual who is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. They have been diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 134 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/75 mmHg to 124/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. They are receiving several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and antibiotics. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 65-81 mg/dL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while creatinine and lactate levels are within normal range. Imaging shows bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's condition requires ICU care, including fluid management, nutritional support, and glycemic control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: Intensive care unit stay and medications like corticoster"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and came with  with
   hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2 sat
   >90%.  Then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
    Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   now intubated.  ABG and RSBI this morning is reassuring.   Now having
   SBT.  Underlying pulmonary process appears unchanged and it is unclear
   why she has improved.  It is possible she responded to antibiotics, but
   also possible she has improving ARDS of unknown etiology.   She was not
   diuresed yesterday so it is unlikely that this is related to heart
   failure.  Lung biopsy might be diagnostic, but will unlikely change
   management and represents risk.
   -If patient tolerated SBT for 2hours, can try to extubate.
   -trying to keep K>4.5, to reverese her metabolic acidosis which further
   increases her respiratory hypercarbia.
   -It is unlikely her improvement is due to antiobiotic regimen given
   negative cultures this far.  We will continue azithromycin for 5 more
   days fo atypical coverage since this cannot yet be excluded.
   -f/uchlamydia pneumoniae serologies.
   -CXR in am
    -F/U ID recs
    # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  Unlikely to be related to intravascular depletion.
   Patient has a history of PE, which cannot be ruled out.
    -LENIs negative, unlikely PE.
   -Monitor on Tele
   -work up when patient more stable
   # Anemia- Has remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active
   bleeding. Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but drop is
   concerning for other source, though pulmonary hemorrhage is now
   unlikely given Bal results.  Stool guaiac negative.  Probably anemia of
   chronic disease.  Will consider transfusion if HCT<21 or patient
   hemodynamically unstable.
     -check HCT in PM, stable
    -guaiac all stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation.
   -senna, , milk of magnesia and lactulose  down NG.  BM yesterday,
   guaiac negative.
   #Suprapubic Catheter and chronic UTIs
   -ID recommends changing out suprpubic cath, we will talk to nursing,
   and if not possible will consult urology.
   #.  Pain control : Patient now sedated.
    - when patient extubated, will switch back to previous pain regimen .
   # GERD - Continue omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Tobacco use - Continue nicotine patch
   # FEN:  Tube feeds.
   # Access: PICC.  A-line not working.  If patient is extubated and
   remainst hemodynamically stable we will not replace, but if she has any
   worsening, we will replace.
   -IR replaced PICC  [**8-26**]

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient, a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent UTIs, and a suprapubic catheter, was admitted to the ICU last week for presumed urosepsis. She became unstable on the floor and was brought in with hypoxia, tachypnea, and required a non-rebreather to maintain O2 sat >90%. She was then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

- The patient's ABG and RSBI this morning are reassuring, indicating improvement in her respiratory status. She is now undergoing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The underlying pulmonary process appears unchanged, and it is unclear why she has improved. It is possible she responded to antibiotics or has improving ARDS of unknown etiology.

- The patient was not diuresed yesterday, so it is unlikely that her improvement is related to heart failure. A lung biopsy might be diagnostic but unlikely to change management and represents risk.

- If the patient tolerates the SBT for 2 hours, she can be considered for extubation. Efforts are being made to keep her potassium levels >4.5 to reverse her metabolic acidosis, which further increases her respiratory hypercarbia.

- It is unlikely that her improvement is due to the antibiotic regimen given negative cultures so far. Azithromycin will be continued for 5"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in
   the ICU last week who became unstable on the floor and came with  with
   hypoxia, tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2 sat
   >90%.  Then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
    Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   now intubated.  This is likely secondary to her pulmonary process.
   Pulmonary process documented on CT [**8-21**] has a long differential
   diagnosis including atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma, c. pneumoniae,
   Cryptococcus, legionella, PCP) vs. inhalational injury vs. pulmonary
   hemorrhage vs. BOOP vs. PE vs.  ARDS.  Bronchoscopy was unrevealing,
   but ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage.  She meets some ARDS criteria
   (pa02/Fio2 <200, bilateral patchy infiltrates, acute onset) but also
   has evidence of Right heart strain (BNP >5000, TTE with hyperdynamic
   LV) and more likely explanation.
   -has weaned down to 10/5, RSBI 39 this am, patient awake alwert. RT
   recommends extubation.
   -trying to keep K>4.5, to reverese her metabolic acidosis which further
   increases her respiratory hypercarbia.
   -Continue antibiotic coverage with Vanc, cefepime and azithromycin for
   atypical coverage.  D/C Flagyl yesterday.  Maybe continue to peel off
   antibiotics if she does not respond.  Infectious cause is still likely,
   but non-infectious cause definitely possible.
   -f/uchlamydia pneumoniae serologies.
   -HIV negative, so unlikely PCP.

    -F/U ID recs
    # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  Unlikely to be related to intravascular depletion.
   Patient has a history of PE, which cannot be ruled out.
    -LENIs negative, unlikely PE.
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Has remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active
   bleeding. Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but drop is
   concerning for other source, though pulmonary hemorrhage is now
   unlikely given Bal results.
     -check HCT in PM, stable
    -guaiac stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation.
   -senna, , milk of magnesia and lactulose  down NG.  BM yesterday,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She was previously treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU last week but became unstable on the floor and required intubation due to hypoxia, tachypnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She now has bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest imaging and meets some criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although she also shows signs of right heart strain. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8째C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 103/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 of 40%. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated. She now meets some criteria for ARDS, but also has evidence of right heart strain. A long differential diagnosis for her pulmonary process includes atypical pneumonia, inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bronchoscopy ruled out pulmonary hemorrhage, and the patient is being weaned down to 10/5,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill, overweight/obese male with respiratory failure due to ARDS. He has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. His condition has shown some improvement as he is now tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and is expected to undergo an extubation trial today. The patient's chest X-ray remains abnormal, indicating ongoing pulmonary infiltrates attributed to ARDS. He has completed an empiric course of antimicrobials. The patient also has a history of penicillin allergy and is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding (TF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary condition is respiratory failure due to ARDS. There is a risk that he may not be able to sustain spontaneous breathing once extubated.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates attributed to ARDS. These infiltrates can lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the invasive nature of mechanical ventilation.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of DVT.
5. Stress Ulcer: Critically ill patients are at risk for stress ulcers, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is currently positive, indicating fluid overload. Monitoring electroly"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The note mentions that the patient experienced transient hypotension, which responded to an IV fluid bolus. The patient's airway pressure - inflation line (A-line) tracing was somewhat dampened, indicating possible fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's respiratory system is being supported with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 355 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 39. These settings suggest that the patient is receiving adequate ventilation and oxygenation support.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 117 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 130/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The temperature is within normal limits at 37.3째C.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.8 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.3%, and normal platelet count (Plt) of 309 K/uL. The blood glucose level is well controlled at 81 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes, kidney function, and liver enzymes, are within normal ranges.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including sedatives (midazolam), analgesics (fentanyl), antibiotics (metronidazole, azithromycin, cefepime, and vancomycin), and anticoagulants (heparin sodium).

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities. The chest examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally, with no wheezes or crackles. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

The assessment and plan section of the note indicates that the patient has respiratory failure attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely due to aspiration. The patient is making progress and tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), with plans for extubation trials. The pulmonary infiltrates are attributed to ARDS, and the patient has completed the empiric course of antimicrobials.

The patient's nutritional support involves tube feeding (TF), and pain control measures are resumed. There is a mention of a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) and the need to replace the suprapubic catheter. The patient is on various prophylactic measures"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent
   UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU
   last week who became unstable on the floor and came with  with hypoxia,
   tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2 sat >90%.  Then
   intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
    Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   now intubated.  ABG and RSBI this morning is reassuring.   Now having
   SBT.  Underlying pulmonary process appears unchanged and it is unclear
   why she has improved.  It is possible she responded to antibiotics, but
   also possible she has improving ARDS of unknown etiology.   She was not
   diuresed yesterday so it is unlikely that this is related to heart
   failure.  Lung biopsy might be diagnostic, but will unlikely change
   management and represents risk.
   -Extubated and doing well.
   -trying to keep K>4.5, to reverese her metabolic acidosis which further
   increases her respiratory hypercarbia.
   -It is unlikely her improvement is due to antiobiotic regimen given
   negative cultures this far.  We will continue azithromycin for 5 more
   days fo atypical coverage since this cannot yet be excluded.
   -f/uchlamydia pneumoniae serologies.
   -CXR in am
    -F/U ID recs
    # Tachycardia- persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was
   noted on some, but not all prior admissions.  Originally thought to be
   due to sepsis.  Unlikely to be related to intravascular depletion.
   Patient has a history of PE, which cannot be ruled out.
    -LENIs negative, unlikely PE.
   -Monitor on Tele
   -work up when patient more stable
   # Anemia- Has remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active
   bleeding. Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but drop is
   concerning for other source, though pulmonary hemorrhage is now
   unlikely given Bal results.  Stool guaiac negative.  Probably anemia of
   chronic disease.  Will consider transfusion if HCT<21 or patient
   hemodynamically unstable.
     -check HCT in PM, stable
    -guaiac all stool
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation.
   -senna, , milk of magnesia and lactulose  down NG.  BM yesterday,
   guaiac negative.
   #Suprapubic Catheter
   -ID recommends changing out suprpubic cath, we will talk to nursing,
   and if not possible will consult urology.
   #.  Pain control : Patient now sedated.
    - when patient extubated, will switch back to previous pain regimen .

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She was previously treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU but became unstable on the floor and was readmitted with hypoxia, tachypnea, and required a non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. She was then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

- The patient's underlying pulmonary process appears unchanged, and it is unclear why she has improved. It is possible that she responded to antibiotics, but it is also possible that she has improving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of unknown etiology. She was not diuresed yesterday, so it is unlikely that her improvement is related to heart failure.

- The patient's potassium levels are being monitored to keep them above 4.5 to reverse her metabolic acidosis, which further increases her respiratory hypercarbia.

- It is unlikely that her improvement is due to the current antibiotic regimen given negative cultures so far. Azithromycin will be continued for 5 more days for atypical coverage since this cannot yet be excluded. Chlamydia pneumoniae serologies will also be checked.

- The patient has persistent tachycardia since admission. Tachycardia was noted on some,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a history of spina bifida, hydrocephalus, chronic UTIs, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was hospitalized for ethanol use and treated for withdrawal. She developed fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, which were initially thought to be aspiration pneumonia. Despite negative cultures, she was treated for presumed pneumonia and showed improvement. Her respiratory status worsened, leading to intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and bronchoscopy. She was extubated and placed on CPAP for sleep apnea. The patient complains of back pain and has a history of ileus and constipation. She also has a suprapubic catheter, which was recently changed. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal coagulation profiles. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain control, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's previous episodes of hypoxia, tachypnea, and need for non-rebreather mask, followed by intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure, suggest the possibility of ARDS. This can be caused by an aspiration event or atypical pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: Despite negative cultures, the patient's symptoms and infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate the possibility of"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent
   UTIs, suprapubic catheter, treated for presumed urosepsis in the ICU
   last week who became unstable on the floor and came with  with hypoxia,
   tachypnea and requiring a non rebreather to maintain O2 sat >90%.  Then
   intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
    Plan:
   #Respiratory Distress:   Likely ARDS [**2-12**] aspiration event or atypical
   PNA.  Intubated [**Date range (1) 1158**].  Now extubated.
   -Extubated and doing well.  Wean 02 today.
   -It is unlikely her improvement is due to antiobiotic regimen given
   negative cultures this far.  We will continue azithromycin for 7 day
   course for atypical coverage since this cannot yet be excluded.  Change
   to PO azithromycin 250mg, day [**4-18**]
   -f/uchlamydia pneumoniae serologies.
   -CXR in am
    # Tachycardia- persistent sinus tachycardia since admission.
   Tachycardia was noted on some, but not all prior admissions.
   Originally thought to be due to sepsis.  Unlikely to be related to
   intravascular depletion.  Patient has a history of PE, which cannot be
   ruled out, though LENIs negative on [**8-26**] and she has IVC filter in
   place.  Possibly [**2-12**] back pain.
    -CTA was initially planned, but patient has no PIV, which is needed
   for contrast.  CTA done [**8-20**] did not show evidence of PE, so unlikely to
   be the cause
   -Monitor on Tele
   # Anemia- Has remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active
   bleeding. Initial drop likely due to hemodilution, but drop is
   concerning for other source, though pulmonary hemorrhage is now
   unlikely given Bal results.  Stool guaiac negative.  Probably anemia of
   chronic disease.  Will consider transfusion if HCT<21 or patient
   hemodynamically unstable.
     -check HCT qday
    -guaiac all stool.  Guaiac negative yesterday.
    # OSA, chronic
   -CPAP at night
   #Abdominal Pain/Constipation- Patient with history of ileus and
   constipation.
   -Continue bowel regimen senna, milk of magnesia and lactulose  PO.
   #Suprapubic Catheter
   - suprpubic cath changed Saturday [**8-27**]
   #.  Pain control : chronic back pain, plan for MRI at BW (due to VP
   shunt and special machine needed).
   -restart home pain regimen
   # GERD - Continue omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Tobacco use - Continue nicotine patch
   # FEN:  Due to concern for aspiration, wanted to put NG and begin Tube

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old woman with a history of spina bifida, hydrocephalus, chronic UTIs, suprapubic catheter, and OSA. She was hospitalized after being found unresponsive following ethanol use and treated for ethanol withdrawal. She developed fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, leading to a suspicion of aspiration event. She was treated for pneumonia, though all cultures were negative. Her respiratory status worsened, and she was transferred to the ICU, where she required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory distress and bronchoscopy. The patient was extubated and remained on CPAP overnight for sleep apnea.

The patient's allergies include penicillins and unknown allergens. She has been receiving various antibiotics and other medications, including heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and azithromycin. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the development of fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on CXR. The patient's weight has increased from 70.6 kg at admission to 155 kg currently.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.4째C, current temperature of 36.5째C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/85 mmHg to 94/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a history of spina bifida, hydrocephalus, chronic UTIs, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was hospitalized for ethanol use and treated for withdrawal. She developed fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, possibly due to aspiration. Despite treatment for pneumonia, her respiratory status worsened, leading to intubation and bronchoscopy. She was later extubated and placed on CPAP for sleep apnea. The patient complained of back pain and refused nasogastric tube insertion for tube feeds. She also has a suprapubic catheter and has been treated for presumed urosepsis. Her current concerns include respiratory distress, persistent sinus tachycardia, anemia, obstructive sleep apnea, abdominal pain/constipation, pain control, GERD, tobacco use, and feeding intolerance due to potential aspiration risk.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an aspiration event or atypical pneumonia. She was intubated but is now extubated and being weaned off oxygen.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia since admission. It may be unrelated to intravascular depletion, and her history of PE (pulmonary embolism) cannot be ruled out. A CTA"
