","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with a complicated medical history, currently experiencing shock of uncertain etiology and acute renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is being treated for various conditions, including potential pulmonary embolism, septic shock, hypovolemia, obstructive shock, right ventricular failure, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is also being evaluated for acute kidney injury, pulmonary hypertension, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and complications related to a recent total knee replacement surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of organ dysfunction indicate a possible septic shock. It is important to monitor his vital signs closely and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest acute kidney injury. Further evaluation and management are required to prevent the progression of renal failure.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's symptoms, such as cough and shortness of breath, along with findings on imaging, raise the suspicion of a pulmonary embolism. Close monitoring and diagnostic tests, such as a CT pulmonary angiography, may be necessary.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure increases the risk of cardiogenic shock. Continuous cardiac monitoring and hemodynamic support may be required.
5. Adrenal Insuff"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with a complicated medical history who is currently in shock of uncertain etiology and marked acute renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments including dopamine, heparin, vancomycin, bicarb, calcium acetate, and hydrocortisone. The patient's vital signs are unstable with low blood pressure and heart rate. His oxygen saturation is at 94% on a nasal cannula. He has crackles in his lungs and bibasilar rhonchi. The patient also has a trace of edema in both lower extremities and a fistulous tract near his left knee joint. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and troponin T levels. The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are low, while his calcium level is within normal range. Imaging shows biatrial enlargement, severe right ventricular hypertrophy, and possible right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient is on empirical antibiotics, stress-dose steroids, and has a plan for further diagnostic tests and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's low blood pressure, high heart rate, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis or septic shock. This is further supported by the presence of crackles in the lungs and bibasilar rhonchi, which may indicate pneumonia. The patient is already receiving empirical antibiotics"

   Chief Complaint: Fatigue
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting occured.  The family states he wishes to be DNR/DNI.
   The prognosis of his end-state pulmonary hypertension was  discussed as
   well as his new acute renal failure.  They do not want him to suffer
   longer and would not want him to go on HD.  They feel his primary goal
   now would be to get home if possible.  Our goal will be to try to wean
   him off the pressors by increasing sildenafil so he can go home with
   hospice.  Palliative care and social work were consulted.
   - Head CT from OSH: sm right subdural hyperdensity--suggest repeat head
   CT also, gas in muscles of mastication and overlying soft tissue,
   bilaterally.  Repeat head CT here showed:
   1. Unchanged rounded 9 mm right frontal extra-axial hyperdensity, more
   likely representing a small meningioma than a subdural hematoma.
   Further evaluation by head MRI with and without contrast is suggested.
   2. Resolution of previously noted gas in the masticator spaces,
   infratemporal fossae and temporomandibular joints.
   - Knee X-ray showed free air in the joint space.
   - He had a central venous O2 sat checked prior to a fluid challenge
   which was 71 (lactate of 1.3).  After 500 cc NS his central venous O2
   sat decreased to 66 (lactate of 1.1).  He also developed crackles to
   his mid lungs and required increasing supp O2 (4L -->6L).  Therefore no
   further fluids given.
   - His TTE showed a markedly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
   The distal apex has relatively normal function. There is moderate to
   severe tricuspid regurgitation, likely secondary to ventricular
   dilatation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension (likely
   UNDERestimated - given severity of tricuspid regurgitation, the right
   atrial pressure is likely substantially greater than 10mm Hg.). There
   is evidence of pressure and volume overload of the right ventricle with
   a small, normally functioning left ventricle.
   - His sildenafil was added back and increased to 50 mg tid.
   - His DA was changed to neo.
   - He received another dose of vanc and was continued on zosyn for
   possible PNA and infection in his knee.
   - He received another 30 gm of kayexylate and lactulose given his
   persistent hyperkalemia.
   - CXR showed interval placement of right PICC with tip terminating in
   low SVC. Possibility of right subpulmonic pleural effusion. Previously
   described bulky mediastinal contours and dispersed bronchograms
   resolved.
   - Flu negative
   - His heparin gtt was stopped as his INR is therapeutic at 2.9 and he
   was rewritted for coumadin for tomorrow.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.   Family meeting yesterday to address goals of care
   goal to wean patient off pressors in order to transition him to home
   for hospice.
   #  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held yesterday to discuss goals of
   care and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion is to attempt to wean
   patient off of pressors in effor to get him home for home hospice
   - well wean pressors as able as below
   # Shock NOS: Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Currently on
   0.9 of neosynepherine
   - will gently diurese with 20 ix lasix and check before and after
   central venous sat as may be fluid overloaded.  Will do with caution as
   peope with RV failure do require some afterload/preload for effective
   circulation
   - increase sildenafil to 75mg tid
   - will explore Flolan infusion vs inhaled NO in attempt to reduce
   pulmonary artery pressure in order to increase systemic blood pressure
   with goal to wean off pressor and transition to home hospice
   - will continue broad spectrum abx for now
   - palliative care c/s
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved with kayexalate and lactulose
   # ARF: Resolving.  Appears patient has acute renal failure during his
   ICU admissions prior, though no available laboratory data at this
   time.  Baseline is around 1.2-1.4.  Multiple possible etiologies.
   Patient does not know what medications he is taking, may have been
   medication error.  Also has been on Bactrim (? for ppx while on
   steroids or for chronic wound) which may have contributed (AIN).  UOP
   has been >50cc/hr since admission to the ICU.  Also, may be actively
   infected/septic
   - Continue to trend
   - Follow UOP with goal >30 and goal to fully wean pressors
   - lasix as above
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - has low Ca, will hold off on further work up given goal of care is
   for patient to go home
   # Cryptogenic organizing pna: Steroid dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**], has been
   unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Patient is not clear that this is
   the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.  On 2L NC at
   night when at home.
   - Treating for possible adrenal insufficiency with stress dose steroids
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   # R TKR with chronic infection: Plain film showing free air within the
   joint space.  This is possible source of infection for septic shock.
   Has been on suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim, though
   wound is still poorly healing.
   - Vanc/Zosyn as above, would consider d/c if able to transition to home
   hospice
   - no further workup given goals of care
   # dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction with RV bowing into LV as
   above.  Prior echo in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV
   dysfunction, likely from prior PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - lasix as above with cautious diuresis  and central venous O2 sat
   before and after diuresis
   # Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs
   while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [**2-28**] PEs, on
   viagra.
   - increase sildenafil as above
   - Heparin gtt given concern for PE
   # Anemia: 33
27, possibly dilutional, no signs of bleeding.  Guaiac pos
   stool in [**Location (un) 250**] ED.  Baseline Hct around 32 per report. Got 1 unit
   prbcs prior to transfer.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Maintain active T&S
   - Transfuse for <21
   # Afib/flutter: On coumadin and digoxin.  Now in SR. Currently has
   therapeutic INR.
   - Hold coumadin for now, heparin gtt
   - Restart digoxin
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - ECG in am
   # ECG changes: He does have S1Q3T3, though not significantly changed
   from prior, patient has old RBBB. Troponin mildly elevated, and some ST
   depression in lateral precordial leads. No CP.
   - no active treatment
   # FEN: NPO for now while on pressors, replete lytes prn
   # Access: R femoral line, PIV

   Comments:
   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds , Family
   meeting held  Comments: With wife [**Name (NI) 837**].
   [**Name2 (NI) 36**] status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation with flutter, and hypothyroidism. He was transferred from another hospital with shock and acute renal failure. The family has made the decision to pursue comfort care and not to continue aggressive treatment. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is resolving. He has been on dialysis and will continue to be monitored for any changes in his renal function.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires pressors to maintain his blood pressure. His current goal is to wean off the pressors and transition to home hospice care.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to prolonged bed rest and poor nutrition. Regular skin assessments and interventions should be implemented to prevent further complications.

4. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, primarily from his knee infection and chronic wound. Pain management strategies should be implemented to ensure the patient's comfort.

5. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia: The patient has a history of steroid-dependent cryptogenic organizing pneumonia since 2004. He is currently on supplemental oxygen and will continue to be monitored for any changes in his respiratory status.

6. Right total knee replacement with chronic infection: The patient has a history of right total knee replacement with a chronic infection."

   Chief Complaint: Fatigue
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting occured.  The family states he wishes to be DNR/DNI.
   The prognosis of his end-state pulmonary hypertension was  discussed as
   well as his new acute renal failure.  They do not want him to suffer
   longer and would not want him to go on HD.  They feel his primary goal
   now would be to get home if possible.  Our goal will be to try to wean
   him off the pressors by increasing sildenafil so he can go home with
   hospice.  Palliative care and social work were consulted.
   - Head CT from OSH: sm right subdural hyperdensity--suggest repeat head
   CT also, gas in muscles of mastication and overlying soft tissue,
   bilaterally.  Repeat head CT here showed:
   1. Unchanged rounded 9 mm right frontal extra-axial hyperdensity, more
   likely representing a small meningioma than a subdural hematoma.
   Further evaluation by head MRI with and without contrast is suggested.
   2. Resolution of previously noted gas in the masticator spaces,
   infratemporal fossae and temporomandibular joints.
   - Knee X-ray showed free air in the joint space.
   - He had a central venous O2 sat checked prior to a fluid challenge
   which was 71 (lactate of 1.3).  After 500 cc NS his central venous O2
   sat decreased to 66 (lactate of 1.1).  He also developed crackles to
   his mid lungs and required increasing supp O2 (4L -->6L).  Therefore no
   further fluids given.
   - His TTE showed a markedly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
   The distal apex has relatively normal function. There is moderate to
   severe tricuspid regurgitation, likely secondary to ventricular
   dilatation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension (likely
   UNDERestimated - given severity of tricuspid regurgitation, the right
   atrial pressure is likely substantially greater than 10mm Hg.). There
   is evidence of pressure and volume overload of the right ventricle with
   a small, normally functioning left ventricle.
   - His sildenafil was added back and increased to 50 mg tid.
   - His DA was changed to neo.
   - He received another dose of vanc and was continued on zosyn for
   possible PNA and infection in his knee.
   - He received another 30 gm of kayexylate and lactulose given his
   persistent hyperkalemia.
   - CXR showed interval placement of right PICC with tip terminating in
   low SVC. Possibility of right subpulmonic pleural effusion. Previously
   described bulky mediastinal contours and dispersed bronchograms
   resolved.
   - Flu negative
   - His heparin gtt was stopped as his INR is therapeutic at 2.9 and he
   was rewritted for coumadin for tomorrow.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary embolisms, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted to the ICU with shock and acute renal failure.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure during his ICU admission. Possible etiologies include medication error, Bactrim use, and active infection/sepsis.
2. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia: The patient has been dependent on steroids since [**Month (only) 1148**] and has been unable to wean off prednisone below 10 mg daily. The patient is unclear about the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.
3. Right ventricular failure: The patient's echo showed marked right ventricular dysfunction with right ventricular bowing into the left ventricle. This indicates chronic right ventricular failure.
4. Chronic knee infection: The patient has a chronic infection in his right knee, which is poorly healing despite suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has persistent hyperkalemia that has resolved with kayexalate and lactulose.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g"

   Chief Complaint: Fatigue
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting occured.  The family states he wishes to be DNR/DNI.
   The prognosis of his end-state pulmonary hypertension was  discussed as
   well as his new acute renal failure.  They do not want him to suffer
   longer and would not want him to go on HD.  They feel his primary goal
   now would be to get home if possible.  Our goal will be to try to wean
   him off the pressors by increasing sildenafil so he can go home with
   hospice.  Palliative care and social work were consulted.
   - Head CT from OSH: sm right subdural hyperdensity--suggest repeat head
   CT also, gas in muscles of mastication and overlying soft tissue,
   bilaterally.  Repeat head CT here showed:
   1. Unchanged rounded 9 mm right frontal extra-axial hyperdensity, more
   likely representing a small meningioma than a subdural hematoma.
   Further evaluation by head MRI with and without contrast is suggested.
   2. Resolution of previously noted gas in the masticator spaces,
   infratemporal fossae and temporomandibular joints.
   - Knee X-ray showed free air in the joint space.
   - He had a central venous O2 sat checked prior to a fluid challenge
   which was 71 (lactate of 1.3).  After 500 cc NS his central venous O2
   sat decreased to 66 (lactate of 1.1).  He also developed crackles to
   his mid lungs and required increasing supp O2 (4L -->6L).  Therefore no
   further fluids given.
   - His TTE showed a markedly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
   The distal apex has relatively normal function. There is moderate to
   severe tricuspid regurgitation, likely secondary to ventricular
   dilatation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension (likely
   UNDERestimated - given severity of tricuspid regurgitation, the right
   atrial pressure is likely substantially greater than 10mm Hg.). There
   is evidence of pressure and volume overload of the right ventricle with
   a small, normally functioning left ventricle.
   - His sildenafil was added back and increased to 50 mg tid.
   - His DA was changed to neo.
   - He received another dose of vanc and was continued on zosyn for
   possible PNA and infection in his knee.
   - He received another 30 gm of kayexylate and lactulose given his
   persistent hyperkalemia.
   - CXR showed interval placement of right PICC with tip terminating in
   low SVC. Possibility of right subpulmonic pleural effusion. Previously
   described bulky mediastinal contours and dispersed bronchograms
   resolved.
   - Flu negative
   - His heparin gtt was stopped as his INR is therapeutic at 2.9 and he
   was rewritted for coumadin for tomorrow.

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.
   # Shock NOS: Differential includes massive PE versus infection /
   sepsis.  Patient has acute on chronic renal failure so has been unable
   to be imaged with CTA.  Has history of multiple PEs while on coumadin.
   Also has several sources of infection including oral etiology from
   recent dental instrumentation (bone spur removal) or chronic wound
   infection post TKR and redo in [**Month (only) 51**]. Has a history of staph bacteremia
   and has been on suppressive therapy from his knee wound with
   Augmentin.  CXR without any clear infiltrate, UA at [**Location (un) 250**] was
   negative, not grossly positive here.  Rectal temperature was low at 91
   at [**Location (un) 250**], and patient has been hypotensive/not fluid responsive.
   Rec'd vanc/levo/ctx in ED at [**Location (un) 250**].  On peripheral dopa initially,
   now on 6 mcg/kg.  Appears overall hypovolemic/dry MM.  Now mounting a
   leukocytosis.  Symptoms not c/w meningitis
   - Urgent TTE to evaluate for RV dysfunction as unable to get CTA given
   renal failure
   - If R heart strain on TTE, then will get V/Q scan as lung parenchyma
   does not appear severely compromised on CXR - needs imaging early
   - Consider tPA if e/o of massive PE
   - Measure CVP from femoral line to determine volume status, baseline at
   rest given Rt heart dysfunction and pulm htn is likely elevated (goal
   CVP around 16 or until he has increased oxygen requirement) - 14
   - IVF (evolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, will avoid LR given
   renal failure and [**Last Name (LF) 5144**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] give NaBicarb in D5W now)/dopamine to
   maintain MAPs >65, wean as tolerated
   - Maintain access
   - Vanc/Zosyn for broad coverage given patient's sources and multiple
   recent hospitalizations.  Consider adding Cipro to cover all resistant
   gram negatives.  Will dose vanc by levels - rec'd 1 dose at [**Location (un) 250**]
   this evening.  Will check trough in am and dose as indicated.
   - Repeat CXR here, will follow up read of [**Location (un) 250**] scan
   - Plain film of R knee to assess for osteo/hardware
   - Send blood cultures, follow up ucx
   - Send stool for C. diff, will treat empirically for now with flagyl
   pending negative cultures given the severity of illness
   - Check pulsus to rule out obstructive cardiogenic shock as etiology
   - Daily ECG
   - Will treat empirically for adrenal insufficiency
   - A-line if still on pressors in am
   # Weakness: Likely toxic-metabolic. No other distinct symptoms of
   infection or other etiology.  Has been on long standing steroids since
   [**Month (only) 1148**], unable to wean.  [**Month (only) 51**] be an element of adrenal insufficiency,
   though patient rec'd decadron 10 mg at OSH without improvement in
   pressures.  Has had decreased appetite over the last few days wtih poor
   PO intake.  Also has acute renal failure/uremia which is likely
   contributing to symptoms.
   - Check random cortisol
   - Check TSH
   - Follow electrolytes
   - Transfuse prn as below
   - Cycle CEs
   - Follow renal function
   # Hyperkalemia: Increased from prior at [**Location (un) 250**].  No ECG changes.
   Likely secondary to renal failure, though appears to be improving
   here.  Also complicated by acidosis.
   - Kayexelate now with Calcium Gluconate
   - Consider renal consult in am for possible HD
   - Regular ECGs
   # ARF: Appears patient has acute renal failure during his ICU
   admissions prior, though no available laboratory data at this time.
   Baseline is around 1.2-1.4.  Multiple possible etiologies.  Patient
   does not know what medications he is taking, may have been medication
   error.  Also has been on Bactrim (? for ppx while on steroids or for
   chronic wound) which may have contributed (AIN).  UOP has been >50cc/hr
   since admission to the ICU.  Also, may be actively infected/septic
   - Send urine lytes - FeNa was 4.9% at OSH
   - Continue to trend
   - Follow UOP
   - Urine eos
   - Hold lasix for now
   - IVF prn
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Will add calcium acetate given elevated phos and low calcium -
   consider renal consult in am for further recommendations
   # Cryptogenic organizing pna: Steroid dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**], has been
   unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Patient is not clear that this is
   the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.  On 2L NC at
   night when at home.
   - Treating for possible adrenal insufficiency as above
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5141**], pulmonologist at [**Hospital1 1031**] for information, will need
   to clarify outpatient prednisone regimen
   - CXR as above
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   # R TKR with chronic infection: This is possible source of infection.
   Has been on suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim, though
   wound is still poorly healing.
   - Vanc/Zosyn as above
   - Patient should likely have ESR/CRP as outpatient, though will not
   send while decompensated
   - Plain film as above
   - Will contact patient's surgeon at [**Hospital1 1031**] or PCP tomorrow for further
   information on the status of this chronic infection.
   - Attempt to swab inner aspect of wound and send for culture
   - Ortho consult in am
   # dCHF: Last ECHO in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV
   dysfunction, likely from prior PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - Urgent TTE as above
   - Holding lasix for now as above
   - Careful with volume status given diastolic CHF, per report was very
   volume overloaded during ICU stay in Octobter at NWH
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   # Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs
   while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [**2-28**] PEs, on
   viagra.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Heparin gtt given concern for PE
   # Anemia: Guaiac pos stool in [**Location (un) 250**] ED.  Baseline Hct around 32 per
   report. Got 1 unit prbcs prior to transfer.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Maintain active T&S
   - Transfuse for goal of 25 given likely hypovolemia
   # Afib/flutter: On coumadin and digoxin.  Now in SR. Currently has
   therapeutic INR.
   - Hold coumadin for now, heparin gtt
   - Restart digoxin
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - ECG in am
   # ECG changes: He does have S1Q3T3, though not significantly changed
   from prior, patient has old RBBB. Troponin mildly elevated, and some ST
   depression in lateral precordial leads.
   - Cycle CE
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - Daily ECG
   # FEN: NPO for now while on pressors, replete lytes prn, gentle IVF
   boluses to wean pressor
   # Access: R femoral line, PIV

","Summary:
- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, COPD, chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.
- He was transferred from another hospital with shock and acute renal failure.
- The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including a chronic wound infection post total knee replacement (TKR), a possible medication error, and a history of staph bacteremia.
- He is currently on multiple medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.
- The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, impaired skin integrity, hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and right ventricular dysfunction.
- Further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms, including imaging studies, blood cultures, and renal function tests.
- The patient's family has discussed his wishes to be DNR/DNI, and the medical team is working towards weaning him off pressors to prepare for possible discharge with hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors suggest ongoing shock, which could be due to sepsis, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac dysfunction.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria indicate acute renal failure, which may be secondary to sepsis, hypoperfusion, or nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including a chronic wound infection post TKR and a history of staph bacteremia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, but further cultures and imaging studies are needed to identify the causative organism.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a known history of pulmonary hypertension, which can contribute to right ventricular strain and dysfunction.
5. Right Ventricular Dysfunction: The patient's echocardiogram shows marked dilation and hypokinesis of the right ventricle, along with moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. This indicates right heart strain, likely due to pulmonary hypertension and chronic hypoxia.
6. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic steroid use and poor oral intake, which could predispose him to developing cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's recent steroid use and presentation with weakness and poor oral intake raise the possibility of adrenal insufficiency.
8. Hyperkalemia: The patient has persistent hyperkalemia, which may be related to his acute renal failure or other underlying conditions such as acidosis or medication effects.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details from the patient's medical history and further investigations may be necessary to fully understand his condition and potential medical complications."

   ECHO: Markedly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. The distal apex
   has relatively normal function. There is moderate to severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, likely secondary to ventricular dilatation. At least
   moderate pulmonary hypertension (likely UNDERestimated - given severity
   of tricuspid regurgitation, the right atrial pressure is likely
   substantially greater than 10mm Hg.). There is evidence of pressure and
   volume overload of the right ventricle with a small, normally

   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.   Family meeting yesterday to address goals of care
   goal to wean patient off pressors in order to transition him to home
   for hospice.
   #  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held yesterday to discuss goals of
   care and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion is to attempt to wean
   patient off of pressors in effor to get him home for home hospice
   - well wean as tolerated as below
   # Shock NOS: Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Currently on
   0.9 of neosynepherine
   - will gently diurese with 20 ix lasix and check before and after
   central venous sat as may be fluid overloaded.  Will do with caution as
   peope with RV failure do require some afterload/preload for effective
   circulation
   - increase sildenafil to 75mg tid
   - will explore Flolan infusion vs inhaled NO in attempt to reduce
   pulmonary artery pressure in order to increases systemic blood pressure
   - will continue broad spectrum abx for now
   - palliative care c/s
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved with kayexalate and lactulose
   # ARF: Resolving.  Appears patient has acute renal failure during his
   ICU admissions prior, though no available laboratory data at this
   time.  Baseline is around 1.2-1.4.  Multiple possible etiologies.
   Patient does not know what medications he is taking, may have been
   medication error.  Also has been on Bactrim (? for ppx while on
   steroids or for chronic wound) which may have contributed (AIN).  UOP
   has been >50cc/hr since admission to the ICU.  Also, may be actively
   infected/septic
   - Continue to trend
   - Follow UOP with goal >30 and goal to fully wean pressors
   - lasix as above
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - has low Ca, will hold off on further work up given goal of care is
   for patient to go home
   # Cryptogenic organizing pna: Steroid dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**], has been
   unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Patient is not clear that this is
   the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.  On 2L NC at
   night when at home.
   - Treating for possible adrenal insufficiency with stress dose steroids
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   # R TKR with chronic infection: Plain film showing free air within the
   joint space.  This is possible source of infection for septic shock.
   Has been on suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim, though
   wound is still poorly healing.
   - Vanc/Zosyn as above
   - no further workup given goals of care
   # dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction as above.  Prior echo in
   [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV dysfunction, likely from prior
   PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - lasix as above with cautious diuresis
   # Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs
   while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [**2-28**] PEs, on
   viagra.
   - increase sildenafil as above
   - Heparin gtt given concern for PE
   # Anemia: Guaiac pos stool in [**Location (un) 250**] ED.  Baseline Hct around 32 per
   report. Got 1 unit prbcs prior to transfer.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Maintain active T&S
   - Transfuse for goal of 25 given likely hypovolemia
   # Afib/flutter: On coumadin and digoxin.  Now in SR. Currently has
   therapeutic INR.
   - Hold coumadin for now, heparin gtt
   - Restart digoxin
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - ECG in am
   # ECG changes: He does have S1Q3T3, though not significantly changed
   from prior, patient has old RBBB. Troponin mildly elevated, and some ST
   depression in lateral precordial leads.
   - Cycle CE
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - Daily ECG
   # FEN: NPO for now while on pressors, replete lytes prn, gentle IVF
   boluses to wean pressor
   # Access: R femoral line, PIV

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation/flutter, hypothyroidism, and chronic knee infection. He was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with shock and acute renal failure. The family has discussed the patient's goals of care and has decided to wean him off the pressors in order to transition him to home for hospice.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure during his ICU admission, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.4. Multiple possible etiologies are being considered, including medication error, Bactrim use, and possible sepsis. The goal is to trend towards a urine output of >30 cc/hr and fully wean off the pressors.

2. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia: The patient has been dependent on steroids since [**Month (only) 1148**] and has been unable to wean below 10 mg daily. The patient is unsure about the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily. Supplemental oxygen will be continued as needed.

3. Right ventricular failure: The patient's echo shows marked right ventricular dysfunction. Prior echo in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 65%"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The note mentions several conditions and potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Shock: The patient likely has right ventricular (RV) failure due to severe pulmonary hypertension. Gentle diuresis with monitoring of parameters and close reassessment is planned. Continuous empiric anticoagulation with heparin is also recommended.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, possibly due to poor forward flow. Gentle diuresis is planned to improve renal function.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in the blood. Monitoring and diuresis will be used to manage this condition.

4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has chronic thromboembolic disease, leading to pulmonary hypertension. Heparin gtt as above and continuous sildenafil, which may be titrated up, are planned to manage this condition.

5. Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP)/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient likely has recurrent aspiration based on their history and exam. Measures such as elevating the head of bed (HOB) up 30 degrees at all times and starting a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) are planned.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned below. The patient's family met yesterday and discussed goals of care, planning to transition to hospice measures with the goal of getting the patient home.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. Firstly, the patient is in shock, likely due to right ventricular (RV) failure in the setting of underlying severe pulmonary hypertension. Gentle diuresis is being monitored, and the patient is receiving continuous empiric anticoagulation with heparin.

Secondly, the patient is suffering from acute renal failure, which appears to be improving with gentle diuresis due to poor forward flow.

Thirdly, the patient has hypernatremia, which is being monitored with diuresis.

Fourthly, the patient has pulmonary hypertension, which is a result of chronic thromboembolic disease. The patient is receiving heparin gtt as above and may have sildenafil titrated up.

Fifthly, the patient likely has bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), possibly due to recurrent aspiration based on the patient's history, exam. The patient will be placed with the head of bed elevated 30 degrees at all times and started on proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Lastly, the patient had a right total knee replacement (TKR"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.   Family meeting yesterday to address goals of care
   goal to wean patient off pressors in order to transition him to home
   for hospice.
   #  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held 2 days ago to discuss goals of
   care and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion is to attempt to wean
   patient off of pressors in effor to get him home for home hospice
   - able to wean off pressors overnight but had to be restarted a low
   dose this morning
   - palliative care following, appreciate recommendations - working to
   transition patient home to hospice.  Did not start Flolan overnight as
   was able to wean off pressors.  Suspect that patient will be able to be
   weaned off pressors today and should be able to travel home without
   Flolan
   # Shock NOS:  Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Currently on
   XXXXX of neosynepherine.  Lasix challenge yesterday suggestive of
   slighty hypovolemia, also dropped pressures to 60's with AMS with fast
   recovery.  Patient with extremely poor forward flow and has no ability
   to maintain bp with changes in posture.  Increased sildenafil to 75mg
   tid.
   - continue sildenafil to 75mg tid, consider increase to 100
   - continue to explore Flolan if unale to wean off pressors in order to
   increase systemic blood pressure with goal to wean off pressor and
   transition to home hospice
   - will continue broad spectrum abx for now
   - palliative care as above
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved with kayexalate and lactulose
   # ARF: Resolving, Cr 2.9 this morning. Appears patient has acute renal
   failure during his ICU admissions prior, though no available laboratory
   data at this time.  Baseline is around 1.2-1.4.  Multiple possible
   etiologies.  Patient does not know what medications he is taking, may
   have been medication error.  Also has been on Bactrim (? for ppx while
   on steroids or for chronic wound) which may have contributed (AIN).
   UOP has been >50cc/hr since admission to the ICU.  Also, may be
   actively infected/septic
   - Continue to trend
   - Follow UOP with goal >30 and goal to fully wean pressors
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - has low Ca, will hold off on further work up given goal of care is
   for patient to go home
   # Cryptogenic organizing pna: Steroid dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**], has been
   unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Patient was not clear on admission
   that this is the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.  On
   2L NC at night when at home.
   - Treating for possible adrenal insufficiency with stress dose steroids
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   # R TKR with chronic infection: Plain film showing free air within the
   joint space.  This is possible source of infection for septic shock.
   Has been on suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim, though
   wound is still poorly healing.
   - Vanc/Zosyn as above, would consider d/c if able to transition to home
   hospice
   - no further workup given goals of care
   # dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction with RV bowing into LV as
   above.  Prior echo in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV
   dysfunction, likely from prior PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - cautious fluid status managment as in very delicate balance
   # Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs
   while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [**2-28**] PEs, on
   viagra.
   - sildenafil as above
   - Heparin gtt given concern for PE
   # Anemia: 26 down from 33 two days ago. Ppossibly dilutional, no signs
   of bleeding though has guaiac pos stool in [**Location (un) 250**] ED.  Baseline Hct
   around 32 per report. Got 1 unit prbcs prior to transfer.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Maintain active T&S
   - Transfuse for <21
   # Afib/flutter: On coumadin and digoxin.  Now in SR. INR XXXXXX.
   Coumadin held last night at pt was supratherapeutic
   - continue coumadin
   - continue digoxin
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - ECG in am
   # ECG changes: He does have S1Q3T3, though not significantly changed
   from prior, patient has old RBBB. Troponin mildly elevated, and some ST
   depression in lateral precordial leads. No CP.
   - no active treatment
    # FEN: NPO for now while on pressors, replete lytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary embolisms, pulmonary hypertension, chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU with shock and acute renal failure. The family had a meeting to discuss goals of care and decided to attempt to wean the patient off pressors in order to transition him to home for hospice care. 

Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.9 this morning. He also had acute renal failure during previous ICU admissions, but no available laboratory data at the time. Multiple possible etiologies include medication error and infection. The patient's baseline creatinine level is around 1.2-1.4. His urine output has been >50cc/hr since admission to the ICU. 
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, with blood pressures in the 60s and unresponsiveness for 15-30 seconds. He required pressor support.
3. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia: The patient has been steroid-dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**] and has been unable to wean below 10 mg daily. The patient was not clear on admission that this is the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily. He is on 2L NC at night when at home.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.   Family meeting yesterday to address goals of care
   goal to wean patient off pressors in order to transition him to home
   for hospice.
   #  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held 2 days ago to discuss goals of
   care and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion is to attempt to wean
   patient off of pressors in effor to get him home for home hospice.
   Discussed medication regimen at length with team and the following
   decisions were made:
   - will increase sildenafil today to 100mg tid in effort to treat his RV
   failure, keep him off pressors and allow him to go home
   - will d/c iv antibiotics as has been no clear infection
   - continue one additional day of stress dose steroids, will then change
   to po regimen
   - will d/c coumadin given patient was guaiac (+) as OSH given risk of
   bleed and coumadin held overnight but continues to rise
   - Will no start Flolan as have been able to wean off pressor sand
   maintain blood pressures in 80
s just with sildenafil
   - PT consult tomorrow to ensure that patient is able to stand and walk
   several steps as this goal is important for quality of life at home
   - palliative care following, appreciate recommendations - working to
   transition patient home to hospice.  Did not start Flolan overnight as
   was able to wean off pressors.  Suspect that patient will be able to be
   weaned off pressors today and should be able to travel home without
   Flolan
   # Shock NOS:  Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Currently off
   of neosynepherine.  Lasix challenge yesterday suggestive of slighty
   hypovolemia, also dropped pressures to 60's with AMS with fast
   recovery.  Patient with extremely poor forward flow and has no ability
   to maintain bp with changes in posture.  Increased sildenafil to 75mg
   tid.
   - continue sildenafil to 75mg tid, increase to 100mg tid as above
   - Flolan as above
   - d/c abx as above
   - palliative care as above
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   # ARF: Resolving
   - Continue to trend
   - Follow UOP with goal >30 and goal to fully wean pressors
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - has low Ca, will hold off on further work up given goal of care is
   for patient to go home
   # Cryptogenic organizing pna: Steroid dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**], has been
   unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Patient was not clear on admission
   that this is the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.  On
   2L NC at night when at home.
   - steroids as above
   - continue po Bactrim for ppx
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   # Leukocytosis: Stable, likely  [**2-28**] steroids
   -          trend
   -
   # R TKR with chronic infection: Plain film showing free air within the
   joint space.  This is possible source of infection for septic shock.
   Has been on suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim, though
   wound is still poorly healing.
   - d/c abx as above
   - no further workup given goals of care
   # dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction with RV bowing into LV as
   above.  Prior echo in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV
   dysfunction, likely from prior PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - cautious fluid status managment as in very delicate balance
   # Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs
   while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [**2-28**] PEs, on
   viagra.
   - sildenafil as above
   - Heparin gtt given concern for PE
   # Anemia: 26 down from 33 two days ago. Possibly dilutional, no signs
   of bleeding though has guaiac pos stool in [**Location (un) 250**] ED.  Baseline Hct
   around 32 per report. Got 1 unit prbcs prior to transfer.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for <21
   # Afib/flutter:  Coumadin held last night at pt was supratherapeutic
   - d/c oumadin as above
   - continue digoxin as keeping patient rate controlled important for
   maintenance of BP and quality of life
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # ECG changes: He does have S1Q3T3, though not significantly changed
   from prior, patient has old RBBB. Troponin mildly elevated, and some ST
   depression in lateral precordial leads. No CP.
   - no active treatment

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary embolisms, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and hypothyroidism. He was transferred from another hospital with shock and acute renal failure. The patient's family had a meeting to discuss goals of care, deciding to attempt to wean the patient off pressors in order to transition him to home for hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is resolving. It is important to continue monitoring kidney function and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension and had episodes of unresponsiveness. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary to maintain adequate circulation.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of infection. Regular assessment and appropriate skincare measures should be implemented.
4. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia: The patient has cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, which is steroid-dependent. Steroid treatment should be continued as prescribed.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to stress from steroids. Trend and monitor white blood cell counts regularly.
6. Right Total Knee Replacement with Chronic Infection: The patient has a history of right total knee replacement with chronic infection. This could be a potential source of infection. Dis"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of chronic wound infection and osteomyelitis following right total knee replacement. He is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of multiple medical conditions including right ventricular (RV) failure due to pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and bronchiolitis obliterate organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's goals of care include transitioning to hospice measures and getting him home. 

The patient's progress note indicates that his RV failure has resolved with the titration of sildenafil and RV afterload reduction. The plan is to titrate up sildenafil to 100 mg three times a day and monitor for symptomatic hypotension. The patient is also on anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin, but it was held today due to a supratherapeutic level. Stress-dose steroids have been weaned off, and the patient will transition back to oral prednisone 10 mg once daily. 

Acute renal failure has improved with RV afterload reduction and better cardiac output. Hypernatremia is being managed by encouraging oral intake. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and lactate levels. Other lab abnormalities include elevated troponin T, CK, CKMB, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilir"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.   Family meeting held to address goals of care
 goal to
   wean patient off pressors in order to transition him to home for
   hospice.  Hospice is being set up currently, family needs a day to get
   their home ready and then plan to d/c home tomorrow
   #  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held 3 days ago to discuss goals of
   care and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion is to attempt to wean
   patient off of pressors in effor to get him home for home hospice.
   Discussed medication regimen at length with team yesterdayand the
   following decisions were made:
   - continue sildenafil at 100mg tid to treat his RV failure, keep him
   off pressors and allow him to go home with hospice
   - will d/c iv antibiotics as has been no clear infection
   - continue one additional day of stress dose steroids, will then change
   to prednisone 10mg po qd
   - will continue po bactrim and augmentin for chronic osteomyelitis
   suppression
   - will d/c coumadin given patient was guaiac (+) as OSH given risk of
   bleed  - patient to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 206**] in 2 week and INR will be drawn
   then/determination whether or not to restart
   - Will not start Flolan as have been able to wean off pressor sand
   maintain blood pressures in 80
s just with sildenafil
   - PT consult to ensure that patient is able to stand and walk several
   steps as this goal is important for quality of life at home
   - palliative care following, appreciate recommendations - working to
   transition patient home to hospice.  Did not start Flolan as was able
   to wean off pressors and patient has remained cautiously stable for 24
   hours off pressor support.
   # Shock NOS:  Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Currently off
   of neosynepherine.  Lasix challenge yesterday suggestive of slighty
   hypovolemia, also dropped pressures to 60's with AMS with fast
   recovery.  Patient with extremely poor forward flow and has little
   ability to maintain bp with changes in posture.
   - continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   - Flolan as above
   - abx d/c'ed as above
   - palliative care as above
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   # ARF: Resolving
   - Continue to trend
   - Follow UOP with goal >30 and goal to fully wean pressors
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU with shock and acute renal failure. The patient's current plan is to wean him off pressors and transition him to home for hospice care. The goals of care include pain control, managing renal failure, addressing hypotension, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly. It is essential to monitor fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and adjust medications accordingly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management, such as fluid administration and vasopressor support, are necessary.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infections. Regular turning and assessment of the skin, along with proper wound care, are crucial.
4. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia: The patient has a history of steroid-dependent cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Ongoing monitoring for respiratory symptoms and adjusting the steroid dosage as needed are important.
5. Chronic Osteomyelitis: The patient has chronic osteomyelitis in his right knee. Continued suppression therapy with Bactrim and Augmentin is necessary to prevent further infections.

   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.   Family meeting held to address goals of care
 goal to
   wean patient off pressors in order to transition him to home for
   hospice.  Hospice is being set up currently, family needs a day to get
   their home ready and then plan to d/c home tomorrow
   #  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held 3 days ago to discuss goals of
   care and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion is to attempt to wean
   patient off of pressors in effor to get him home for home hospice.
   Discussed medication regimen at length with team yesterdayand the
   following decisions were made:
   - continue sildenafil at 100mg tid to treat his RV failure, keep him
   off pressors and allow him to go home with hospice
   - will d/c iv antibiotics as has been no clear infection
   - continue one additional day of stress dose steroids, will then change
   to prednisone 10mg po qd
   - will continue po bactrim and augmentin for chronic osteomyelitis
   suppression
   - will d/c coumadin given patient was guaiac (+) as OSH given risk of
   bleed  - patient to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 206**] in 2 week and INR will be drawn
   then/determination whether or not to restart
   - Will not start Flolan as have been able to wean off pressor sand
   maintain blood pressures in 80
s just with sildenafil
   - PT consult to ensure that patient is able to stand and walk several
   steps as this goal is important for quality of life at home
   - palliative care following, appreciate recommendations - working to
   transition patient home to hospice.  Did not start Flolan as was able
   to wean off pressors and patient has remained cautiously stable for 24
   hours off pressor support.
   # Shock NOS:  Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Currently off
   of neosynepherine.  Lasix challenge yesterday suggestive of slighty
   hypovolemia, also dropped pressures to 60's with AMS with fast
   recovery.  Patient with extremely poor forward flow and has little
   ability to maintain bp with changes in posture.
   - continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   - Flolan as above
   - abx d/c'ed as above
   - palliative care as above

   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - has low Ca, will hold off on further work up given goal of care is
   for patient to go home
   # Cryptogenic organizing pna: Steroid dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**], has been
   unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Patient was not clear on admission
   that this is the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.  On
   2L NC at night when at home.
   - steroids as above
   - continue po Bactrim for ppx
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   # Leukocytosis: Stable, likely  [**2-28**] steroids
   - trend
   # R TKR with chronic infection: Plain film showing free air within the
   joint space.  This is possible source of infection for septic shock.
   Has been on suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim, though
   wound is still poorly healing.
   - d/c abx as above
   - no further workup given goals of care
   # dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction with RV bowing into LV as
   above.  Prior echo in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV
   dysfunction, likely from prior PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - cautious fluid status managment as in very delicate balance

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and hypothyroidism. He was transferred from another hospital with shock and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes renal failure, pain control, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity.

The family had a meeting to discuss the goals of care and the outcome was to attempt to wean the patient off pressors in order to transition him to home for hospice care. The decisions made regarding medication regimen include continuing sildenafil at 100mg tid to treat right ventricular (RV) failure and keep the patient off pressors, discontinuing IV antibiotics as there is no clear infection, continuing one additional day of stress dose steroids and then changing to prednisone 10mg po qd, continuing po bactrim and augmentin for chronic osteomyelitis suppression, discontinuing coumadin due to the patient being guaiac positive and at risk of bleed, and not starting Flolan as the patient has been able to maintain blood pressures without it.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which requires careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels. It is important to avoid nephrotoxins and continue to trend renal function.

2. Hypotension: The patient's"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.   Family meeting held to address goals of care
 goal to
   wean patient off pressors in order to transition him to home for
   hospice.  Hospice is being set up currently, family needs a day to get
   their home ready and then plan to d/c home tomorrow
   #  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held 3 days ago to discuss goals of
   care and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion is to attempt to wean
   patient off of pressors in effor to get him home for home hospice.
   Discussed medication regimen at length with team yesterdayand the
   following decisions were made:
   - continue sildenafil at 100mg tid to treat his RV failure, keep him
   off pressors and allow him to go home with hospice
   - will d/c iv antibiotics as has been no clear infection
   - continue one additional day of stress dose steroids, will then change
   to prednisone 10mg po qd
   - will continue po bactrim and augmentin for chronic osteomyelitis
   suppression
   - will d/c coumadin given patient was guaiac (+) as OSH given risk of
   bleed  - patient to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 206**] in 2 week and INR will be drawn
   then/determination whether or not to restart
   - Will not start Flolan as have been able to wean off pressor sand
   maintain blood pressures in 80
s just with sildenafil
   - PT consult to ensure that patient is able to stand and walk several
   steps as this goal is important for quality of life at home
   - palliative care following, appreciate recommendations - working to
   transition patient home to hospice.  Did not start Flolan as was able
   to wean off pressors and patient has remained cautiously stable for 24
   hours off pressor support.
   # Shock NOS:  Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Currently off
   of neosynepherine.  Lasix challenge yesterday suggestive of slighty
   hypovolemia, also dropped pressures to 60's with AMS with fast
   recovery.  Patient with extremely poor forward flow and has little
   ability to maintain bp with changes in posture.
   - continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   - Flolan as above
   - abx d/c'ed as above
   - palliative care as above
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   # ARF: Resolving
   - Continue to trend
   - Follow UOP with goal >30 and goal to fully wean pressors
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - has low Ca, will hold off on further work up given goal of care is
   for patient to go home
   # Cryptogenic organizing pna: Steroid dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**], has been
   unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Patient was not clear on admission
   that this is the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.  On
   2L NC at night when at home.
   - steroids as above
   - continue po Bactrim for ppx
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   # Leukocytosis: Stable, likely  [**2-28**] steroids
   - trend
   # R TKR with chronic infection: Plain film showing free air within the
   joint space.  This is possible source of infection for septic shock.
   Has been on suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim, though
   wound is still poorly healing.
   - d/c abx as above
   - no further workup given goals of care
   # dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction with RV bowing into LV as
   above.  Prior echo in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV
   dysfunction, likely from prior PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - cautious fluid status managment as in very delicate balance
   # Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs
   while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [**2-28**] PEs, on
   viagra.
   - continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   - Heparin gtt given concern for PE
   # Anemia: 26 down from 33 two days ago. Possibly dilutional, no signs
   of bleeding though has guaiac pos stool in [**Location (un) 250**] ED.  Baseline Hct
   around 32 per report. Got 1 unit prbcs prior to transfer.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for <21
   # Afib/flutter:  Coumadin held last night at pt was supratherapeutic
   - coumadin as above
   - continue digoxin as keeping patient rate controlled important for
   maintenance of BP and quality of life
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # ECG changes: He does have S1Q3T3, though not significantly changed
   from prior, patient has old RBBB. Troponin mildly elevated, and some ST
   depression in lateral precordial leads. No CP.
   - no active treatment

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and previous pulmonary embolisms. He was admitted to the ICU with shock and acute renal failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Renal failure - The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure. His serum creatinine levels have been elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.
2. Hypotension - The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, which could be related to his chronic condition of pulmonary hypertension and the use of vasodilators like sildenafil.
3. Impaired skin integrity - The patient has poor healing wounds, indicating compromised skin integrity, possibly due to chronic infections and compromised circulation.
4. Leukocytosis - The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, likely due to stress from steroids or chronic infection.
5. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia - The patient has a history of this lung condition, which is steroid-dependent and has not improved despite suppressive therapy.
6. Chronic total knee replacement infection - The patient has a history of chronic infection in his knee joint, indicated by free air seen on plain film.
7. Dilated cardiomyopathy - The patient's echocardiogram shows marked right ventricular dysfunction, with the right ventricle bowing into the left ventricle.
8. Atrial fibrillation - The patient has irregularly irregular heart"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly. It is important to monitor fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and adjust medication dosages accordingly.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low (85/45 mmHg), indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be due to chronic right ventricular failure and sub-optimally treated pulmonary hypertension. Careful management of fluid status and vasopressor support will be necessary.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, possibly due to poor circulation or immobility. Regular skin assessment and appropriate measures to prevent pressure ulcers should be implemented.

4. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia: The patient has been dependent on steroids since [**Month (only) 1148**] for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Steroid tapering should be done cautiously, considering the patient's overall condition and goals of care.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely secondary to stress from steroids. Monitoring of white blood cell count trends and appropriate management based on clinical signs of infection is important.

6. Chronic Knee Infection: The patient has a chronic knee infection resulting in free air within the joint space. This can serve as a possible source of infection. Antibiotic therapy should be considered if"

   bleed  - patient to see me in 2 week and INR will be drawn
   then/determination whether or not to restart
   - palliative care following, appreciate recommendations - working to
   transition patient home to hospice.
   # Shock NOS:  Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Patient with
   extremely poor forward flow and has little ability to maintain bp with
   changes in posture.
   - continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   - abx d/c'ed as above
   - palliative care as above
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved

   - no further workup given goals of care
   # dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction with RV bowing into LV as
   above.  Prior echo in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV
   dysfunction, likely from prior PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - cautious fluid status managment as in very delicate balance
   # Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs
   while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [**2-28**] PEs, on
   viagra.
   - continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   # Anemia: 26 down from 33 two days ago. Possibly dilutional, no signs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including chronic osteomyelitis, right total knee replacement with chronic infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation, anemia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 102/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen and has been extubated.

The patient has received various treatments, including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole), stress dose steroids, sildenafil for right ventricular (RV) failure, digoxin for rate control, and prednisone for chronic osteomyelitis suppression. The patient's current goals of care include continuing sildenafil, discontinuing IV antibiotics, transitioning to hospice care, and palliative treatment.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including shock of unknown etiology (likely due to RV failure and sub-optimally treated pulmonary hypertension), hyperkalemia, acute renal failure (ARF), crypt"

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic knee infection, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and hypothyroidism. He was transferred from Hospital1 with shock and acute renal failure. The family has been anxious about taking care of him at home, and there have been concerns about the equipment not being delivered. A family meeting was held to discuss goals of care and prognosis. The outcome of the discussion was to attempt to wean the patient off pressors in order to transition him to home for hospice care. The patient was set for discharge to home hospice yesterday, but the family was concerned about their ability to provide care at home. A family meeting has been scheduled for today with hospice care company and the palliative team to discuss discharge options. Other options, such as inpatient hospice, will also be considered. The patient prefers to go home.

The patient likely has right ventricular (RV) failure and sub-optimally treated pulmonary hypertension, which may have contributed to his shock. He has leukocytosis, which could be due to stress-related steroids. The patient has been off pressors following treatment for pulmonary hypertension.

   This is a 78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary
   hypertension, COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and
   hypothyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] with shock and acute
   renal failure.   Family meeting held to address goals of care
 goal to
   wean patient off pressors in order to transition him to home for
   hospice.  Plan to d/c home with hospice today.
   #  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held 3 days ago to discuss goals of
   care and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion is to attempt to wean
   patient off of pressors in effor to get him home for home hospice.
   Discussed medication regimen at length with team yesterdayand the
   following decisions were made:
   - continue sildenafil at 100mg tid to treat his RV failure, keep him
   off pressors and allow him to go home with hospice
   - will d/c iv antibiotics as has been no clear infection
   - continue one additional day of stress dose steroids, will then change
   to prednisone 10mg po qd
   - will continue po bactrim and augmentin for chronic osteomyelitis
   suppression
   - will d/c coumadin given patient was guaiac (+) as OSH given risk of
   bleed  - patient to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 206**] in 2 week and INR will be drawn
   then/determination whether or not to restart
   - Will not start Flolan as have been able to wean off pressor sand
   maintain blood pressures in 80
s just with sildenafil
   - PT saw and patient was able to ambulate without getting dizzy and was
   able to walk pushing wheelchair
   - palliative care following, appreciate recommendations - working to
   transition patient home to hospice.
   # Shock NOS:  Likely [**2-28**] to RV failure (chronic) and sub-optimally
   treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has not desired full
   treatment.  Patient with leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to sstress
   dose steroids as not clinically systemically infected.  Currently off
   of neosynepherine.  Lasix challenge yesterday suggestive of slighty
   hypovolemia, also dropped pressures to 60's with AMS with fast
   recovery.  Patient with extremely poor forward flow and has little
   ability to maintain bp with changes in posture.
   - continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   - Flolan as above
   - abx d/c'ed as above
   - palliative care as above
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   # ARF: Resolving
   - Continue to trend
   - Follow UOP with goal >30 and goal to fully wean pressors
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - has low Ca, will hold off on further work up given goal of care is
   for patient to go home
   # Cryptogenic organizing pna: Steroid dependent since [**Month (only) 1148**], has been
   unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Patient was not clear on admission
   that this is the amount of prednisone he is actually taking daily.  On
   2L NC at night when at home.
   - steroids as above
   - continue po Bactrim for ppx
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   # Leukocytosis: Stable, likely  [**2-28**] steroids
   # R TKR with chronic infection: Plain film showing free air within the
   joint space.  This is possible source of infection for septic shock.
   Has been on suppressive therapy with Augmentin and Bactrim, though
   wound is still poorly healing.
   - abx as above
   - no further workup given goals of care
   # dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction with RV bowing into LV as
   above.  Prior echo in [**Month (only) 1148**] showed EF 65% with some old RV
   dysfunction, likely from prior PEs.  Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - cautious fluid status managment as in very delicate balance
   # Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs
   while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [**2-28**] PEs, on
   viagra.
   - continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   - holding anticoagulation as above
   # Anemia: 25 and stable. Possibly dilutional, no signs of bleeding
   though has guaiac pos stool in [**Location (un) 250**] ED.  Baseline Hct around 32 per
   report. Got 1 unit prbcs prior to transfer.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for <21
   # Afib/flutter:  Coumadin held last night at pt was supratherapeutic
   - coumadin as above
   - continue digoxin as keeping patient rate controlled important for
   maintenance of BP and quality of life
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # ECG changes: He does have S1Q3T3, though not significantly changed
   from prior, patient has old RBBB. Troponin mildly elevated, and some ST
   depression in lateral precordial leads. No CP.
   - no active treatment
    # FEN: Regular diet as tolerated, encouraging po fliuds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-inch tall individual with a primary diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on several medications including sildenafil, prilosec, bactrim, augmentin, digoxin, and prednisone.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (88-101 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 118/61 mmHg to 121/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (10-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: leukocytosis which is likely due to stress dose steroids, hyperkalemia that has resolved, acute renal failure (ARF) that is resolving, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, right total knee replacement with chronic infection, decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), multiple pulmonary embolisms, anemia, atrial fibrillation with flutter, and ECG changes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock NOS: The patient likely has right ventricular (RV) failure due to chronic untreated pulmonary hypertension. The patient has not desired full treatment.
   - Continue sildenafil 100mg tid
   - Antibiotics discontinued as above
   - Palliative care as above

2. Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   - Continue to trend. Creatinine 1.5 today which is below baseline.

3. ARF: Resolving
   - Continue to trend.

4. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia: This is not a clear diagnosis but the patient has been steroid-dependent since [Month (only) 1148], unable to wean below 10 mg daily. On 2L NC at night when at home.
   - Steroids as above
   - Continue po Bactrim for prophylaxis
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed

5. Leukocytosis: Stable, likely due to steroids
   - Trend

6. R TKR with chronic infection: Plain film showing free air within the joint space. This is a possible source of infection for septic shock.
   - No further workup given goals of care

7. dCHF: Echo showed marked RV dysfunction with RV bowing into LV as above. Prior echo in [Month (only) 1148] showed EF 65% with some old RV dysfunction, likely from prior PEs. Also with pulmonary hypertension.
   - Cautious fluid status management as in very delicate balance

8. Multiple PEs: On coumadin, subtherapeutic, has h/o developing new PEs while on anticoagulation. Also has pulmonary hypertension [2-28] PEs, on viagra.
