 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: mulit factorial explanation for her altered

   complicated by a UTI (hx of klebsiella). She does have a report of
   ascites seemingly for the first time although by report. We will treat
   her with ceftriaxone (avoiding quinolones given interaction  with INR).
   We should also be covering her for SBP with this regimen. Her rising
   INR and falling albumin with increased frequency of episode of
   encephalopathy are concerning for progressive liver failure. Will
   discuss with liver team the role for IR guided paracentesis given that
   the ascites appears to be new.  There does not appear to be a GI bleed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant and has developed recurrent cirrhosis. She was admitted with increasing encephalopathic features, thought to be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) precipitating hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and she is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin. Other findings include thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, renal failure, and lactate elevation. The patient is also being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can cause altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction due to liver dysfunction and accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): An infection of the fluid accumulated in the abdomen due to liver cirrhosis, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): A form of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease, leading to decreased kidney function.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Infection in the urinary system, which can cause symptoms such as fever, pain during urination, and increased frequency of urination.
5. Hypernatremia: High levels of sodium in"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with Hep C cirrhosis who underwent a transplant but developed recurrent cirrhosis. She is admitted with increasing encephalopathic features, believed to be precipitated by a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is multifactorial and partly explained by decreased stool output and possibly complicated by a UTI (history of Klebsiella). The patient also has a report of ascites for the first time, and her rising INR and falling albumin levels indicate progressive liver failure. 

The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone to cover for both UTI and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Additionally, lactulose and rifaximin are continued to manage hepatic encephalopathy, and vitamin K is continued due to the increased INR. Tacrolimus immunosuppression is also continued. 

The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable with known splenomegaly, and hypernatremia may be due to a pre-renal state. Renal failure is concerning for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and the patient received IV diuresis on 10/13, which will be held today. 

Lactate elevation is likely due to impaired liver function but has improved over the last 24 hours. Other issues are noted in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant but developed recurrent cirrhosis. She was admitted with increasing encephalopathic features, thought to be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) as a precipitant. The patient is currently being observed for mental status changes.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, which is a multifactorial explanation for her altered mental status. This is likely due to decreased stool output and possibly complicated by a UTI (history of Klebsiella infection). She will be treated with ceftriaxone (avoiding quinolones due to interaction with INR) to cover for both UTI and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Her rising INR and falling albumin levels, along with increased frequency of encephalopathy episodes, are concerning for progressive liver failure. An interventional radiology (IR) guided paracentesis may be considered given the new presence of ascites. There does not appear to be any gastrointestinal bleeding or acute intracranial process. Her mental status seems to be slowly improving. She will continue with lactulose and rifaximin, as well as vitamin K. A seven-day course of ceftriaxone will be administered for UTI and SBP. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus will continue. The possibility of IR-guided par"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and a history of liver transplant. She is currently being listed for a second liver transplant. The patient's medical complications include renal failure, hypernatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus, thrombocytopenia, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen from 1.1 to 1.7 this morning. This could be pre-renal or hepatorenal in origin. Further evaluation is needed, including urine analysis for electrolytes, follow-up of creatinine levels, administration of albumin, and holding Lasix.

Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to being NPO for two days due to altered mental status and dehydration secondary to significant diarrhea from lactulose. It is important to check urine electrolytes, administer albumin, and provide a regular diet with fluids as the patient's alertness has improved.

Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, likely triggered by a urinary tract infection. There is low suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Treatment should include decreasing lactulose to every four hours as mental status improves, continuing rifaximin, and stopping ceftriaxone for SBP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who has undergone a liver transplant. She is currently admitted with hepatic encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. The head CT was negative, but further evaluation with blood and urine cultures will be done to assess for any evidence of infection.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis due to HCV and has previously undergone a liver transplant. Currently, she is undergoing evaluation for a possible second liver transplant. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down overall, but her INR is rising from the previous admission. The albumin level is also low at 2.4.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 3.6, indicating a coagulopathy likely secondary to hepatic dysfunction. Vitamin K will be administered three times a day to help manage this condition.

4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin sliding scale will be used to manage her blood glucose levels.

5. Elevated Lactate: The patient's lactate level is elevated, but its significance in the setting of liver"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The patient's medical history includes chronic liver disease, for which he is listed for liver transplantation. 

On review of systems, the patient has not reported any new symptoms except for sobbing throughout the day and evening. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/75 to 147/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -2808 mL over the past 24 hours, with a total intake of 1128 mL and output of 3935 mL. His blood products transfused amount to 1070 mL, and he has received IV fluids totaling 148 mL. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.20, indicating acidosis. His respiratory support is provided through mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, jaundice, systolic murmur, symmetric breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities. His neurological examination is incomplete due to altered mental status.

 This would appear to be related to global
   impairment of marrow function. The differential for her marrow
   suppression is broad, her corrected retic production index is 0.66
   implying the marrow is not functioning and there is no bandemia. This
   could be related to drug effect (she is on cell-cept, CTX can have this
   side effect) in addition she has a hx of CMV IgG +, this could
   represent re-activation of her CMV with bone marrow involvement,
   additional pathogens include, EBV and parvo-virus. She does not appear

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU with hepatic encephalopathy. She received treatment for hepatic encephalopathy and was later transferred to the floor. However, she was readmitted to the ICU due to pancytopenia, which indicates a decrease in red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The patient's lab results show low hemoglobin (Hct), white blood cell count (WBC), and platelet count (Plt). She has been treated with blood products, cryoprecipitate, and plasma transfusions. The patient's condition is complicated by renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage: The patient's low hemoglobin level and platelet count increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
2. Infection: Pancytopenia can make the patient more susceptible to infections due to a weakened immune system.
3. Thrombosis: The combination of low platelet count and the presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear raises concern for thrombotic microangiopathy, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
4. Drug-induced bone marrow suppression: Certain medications, such as cyclosporine (CTX), can cause bone marrow suppression leading to pancytopenia.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   She is re-admitted to the unit now with subseqeutn improvement in her
   renal failure however her Hct dropped from 28 to 19 (confirmed on
   re-check) and her fibrinogen was below her baseline. Her WBC had
   dropped from 7 to 1 as well as drop in plts (although these are low at
   baseline).
   On the floor she received 3U FFP, 1U cryo and 2UPRBC were given. Heme
   onc was consulted.  Hemodynamically she was stable, no increase in O2
   and no change in mentation (A+O x3). No hematemesis or melena or

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and previous hepatic transplantation. She was admitted to the ICU due to hepatic encephalopathy and pancytopenia. The differential diagnosis for her pancytopenia includes drug-induced marrow suppression, CMV reactivation, EBV infection, parvovirus infection, thrombosis of the portal/splenic vein, and hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient's lab results show anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging studies reveal small lung volumes, left pleural effusion, and right-sided pleural effusion. The plan includes further evaluation of CMV, EBV, parvovirus, and the possibility of thrombosis in the portal/splenic vein. Additionally, the patient will be monitored for signs of hemophagocytic syndrome and medication side effects.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Drug-induced marrow suppression: The patient's pancytopenia may be caused by the medications she is taking, such as cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) or a single dose of pip-tazo (piperaquine).
2. CMV reactivation: The patient's history of CMV IgG positivity increases the risk of CMV reactivation in the bone marrow.
3. EBV infection: EBV infection can lead to hemophagocytic syndrome, which is already"

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy and pan-cytopenia of unclear etiology. The patient has been treated with multiple medications, including ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, lactulose, rifaximin, and cellcept. She has shown improvement in renal function after withholding lasix and receiving albumin. The patient's platelet count is low, and there are signs of possible coagulopathy. She has a corrected reticulocyte production index of 0.66, indicating impaired bone marrow function. The patient's blood work shows elevated levels of LDH, D-dimer, and lactate acid. Imaging revealed small lung volumes, left pleural effusion, and small right pleural effusion. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and further evaluation of potential complications such as CMV reactivation, EBV infection, parvovirus infection, thrombosis of the portal/splenic vein, and hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient is being followed by the hematology team and will undergo additional tests to determine the cause of pancytopenia."

   implying the marrow is not functioning and there is no bandemia. This
   could be related to drug effect (she is on cell-cept, CTX can have this

   represent re-activation of her CMV with bone marrow involvement,

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. She is currently being treated for hepatic encephalopathy, pancytopenia, renal failure, and complications related to liver transplant. The patient's condition is complicated by various medical conditions and medications, which may be causing bone marrow suppression. The medical team is considering a bone marrow biopsy to further evaluate the situation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms due to liver dysfunction. The patient is already being treated with lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.

2. Pancytopenia: This refers to a decrease in all types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). The cause of pancytopenia in this patient is suspected to be bone marrow suppression, possibly due to medication side effects or infection.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the blood. This condition has been stabilized by withholding Lasix and receiving albumin.

4. Complications related to Liver Transplant: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and has undergone a liver transplant. She is currently being evaluated for a second transplant. The patient also has coagulopathy (bleeding disorder) and low albumin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications and has received various treatments. The patient has a history of anemia, requiring multiple blood transfusions. There are concerns about the cause of pancytopenia, which may be related to drug reaction, infection, hemophagocytic syndrome, or splenic sequestration. The patient has been listed for a transplant and is currently on ciprofloxacin due to an allergy to ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they show signs of fluid balance issues and respiratory support. The patient's lab results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose levels, and other markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of UTI and is currently on antibiotics. There is a concern for ongoing or recurrent infections due to the immunocompromised state caused by pancytopenia.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and history of anemia may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of any signs of bleeding or bruising is necessary.
3. Organ dysfunction: Abnormalities in kidney function (creatinine levels), liver function (ALT/AST levels), and electrolyte imbalances (s"

 ddx: dic, ttp-hus, med effect with marrow
   hypo-production, blood loss anemia.  Hct drop 10pts over 24hr period,
   guaiac(+) brown stool, hemodynamically stable, no signs of bleed.  With
   hx of liver disease, difficult to interpret platelets and coagulopathy,
   but has elevation in INR to >5, drop in platelets of 20pts, fibrinogen
   drop from 90 to 65.  Of note, pt
s mental status and not changed
   significantly in past 48hrs and has not had a fever during this
   process.  No bleeding from pIV sites or focal sites on exam.   Although
   fibrinogen has dropped and platelets are decreased, overall picture not
   supportive of DIC or TTP/HUS.  Blood loss anemia not likely given
   stable hemodynamics, no site of bleed, and no e/o of overt blood loss
   in stool.  Has been on ctx for 3^rd day.  Ceftriaxone only new
   medication over past 3 days, has been known.  Exam not supportive of
   splenomegaly, CT done [**10-12**] does not comment on spleen size
 appears
   mildly enlarged.  Other infectious source possible with marrow
   suppression, CMV viral load not sent.  Parvovirus/EBV possible, these
   are send outs, will hold until consul input.  No abd pain to support
   thrombosis, but should rule out acute splenic vein thrombosis as
   etiology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with cirrhosis and a history of hepatic encephalopathy, who was admitted to the ICU for pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and concern for DIC, TTP, or blood loss. The patient has been receiving various medications including ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. The patient's mental status has not significantly changed in the past 48 hours and there is no fever during this process. There are no signs of bleeding from IV sites or focal sites on examination. The patient's laboratory results show a drop in platelets, fibrinogen, and hemoglobin levels. The assessment indicates that the overall picture does not support DIC or TTP/HUS, and blood loss anemia is also unlikely. The patient's condition may be related to medication effects, infection, or hemophagocytic syndrome. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's coagulopathy and drop in platelets and fibrinogen levels raise concerns for DIC. However, the absence of bleeding and other supportive findings make this diagnosis less likely.
2. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): The patient's pancytopenia and low platelet count could suggest TTP. However, the absence of fever, neurologic changes, and other supportive findings make this diagnosis less likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU with resolving hepatic encephalopathy. She was previously transferred from the MICU to the floor but is now back in the ICU due to pancytopenia, coagulopathy, concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or blood loss. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on 10/15/2017 at 06:17 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancytopenia: This refers to a reduction in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can lead to anemia, increased risk of infection, and bleeding problems.
2. Coagulopathy: This is a disorder of blood clotting that can increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Concern for DIC: Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a serious condition that can occur as a result of another underlying illness. It involves abnormal blood clotting throughout the body's small blood vessels, leading to organ damage and impaired blood flow.
4. TTP: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare blood disorder characterized by blood clots forming in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to low platelet counts and organ damage.
5. Blood loss"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has resolved hepatic encephalopathy and was previously transferred to the floor from the MICU. She has now been readmitted to the MICU due to pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or blood loss. The patient is also experiencing renal failure, with a creatinine level increasing from 1.1 to 1.7 on 10/14 and then decreasing with albumin. The patient has a history of liver transplantation and is being evaluated for a second transplant. She has significant coagulopathy and low albumin levels due to malnourishment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing a decrease in all blood cell counts, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This condition can lead to an increased risk of infection, anemia, and bleeding.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation function is impaired, which increases the risk of excessive bleeding or clotting.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): DIC is a condition characterized by widespread activation of clotting factors, leading to both bleeding and clot formation. It can result in organ damage"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy and was later transferred to the floor from the MICU on October 14th. However, she was retransferred to the ICU due to pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and concerns about disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or blood loss.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The cause could be either a marrow hypoproduction due to medical effects or a consumptive process from clotting. An abdominal ultrasound ruled out splenic vein thrombosis, but a thrombus was found in the left cephalic vein. Further labs are pending, and the patient's fibrinogen level should be kept above 70, hematocrit below 23, and platelet count above 20.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level initially increased from 1.1 to 1.7 on October 14th, then decreased with albumin administration. The cause is likely pre-renal due to intravenous diuresis and diarrhea caused by lactulose. Hepatorenal syndrome is a concern. The patient's urine output is low, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old female with cirrhosis here with resolving hepatic
   encephalopathy and [**Hospital 2111**] transferred to floor from MICU on [**10-14**], now
   re-admitted with pan-cytopenia of unclear etiology.
   > heme/pancytopenia
 This would appear to be related to global
   impairment of marrow function. The differential for her marrow
   suppression is broad, her corrected retic production index is 0.66
   implying the marrow is not functioning and there is no bandemia. This
   could be related to drug effect (she is on cell-cept, CTX can have this
   side effect or single dose of pip-tazo) in addition she has a hx of CMV
   IgG +, this could represent re-activation of her CMV with bone marrow
   involvement, additional pathogens include, EBV (with hemophagocytic
   syndrome) and parvo-virus. We appreciate the input of the hematology
   team There does not appear to be a bleeding event to explain the drop
   in Hct based on history or exam.  There is also some schistos on periph
   smear although she does not have other components such as renal failure
   (at present) that would argue for a diagnosis of TTP.  Finally, the
   possibility of thrombosis of the portal/splenic vein with worsening
   splenic sequestration will be evaluated by U/S with flow Doppler [**10-16**]
   - CMV, EBV, parvo virus serologies negative
   - U/S abd

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with hepatic encephalopathy and pancytopenia of unclear etiology. She had been transferred from the MICU to the floor on 10/14 but was readmitted due to her condition. The patient's lab results show low white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and low platelet count. The differential for her marrow suppression is broad, and there are several potential causes including drug effect, CMV reactivation, EBV, parvo-virus, and thrombosis of the portal/splenic vein. 

The patient's condition has been managed by adjusting her medications, including stopping cellcept and starting ciprofloxacin. She is also being treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin. The patient's renal failure was stabilized by withholding lasix and receiving albumin. The plan is to follow her closely and continue monitoring her MELD score. 

The patient's disposition remains in the ICU, and her code status is full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hepatic encephalopathy and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis and is awaiting retransplantation. The patient has been receiving various medications, including lactulose, rifaximin, vitamin D, folic acid, RISS, tacrolimus, vitamin K, and famotidine.

On examination, the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 145/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient has jaundice but no other significant abnormalities on physical examination.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and a decreasing platelet count. Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, abnormal coagulation profile, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood cultures have been positive for bacteria.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count continues to decrease precipitously, indicating a potential complication of pancytopenia. Further investigation is needed to determine the etiology of this condition.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient"

   57 year old female with cirrhosis here with resolving hepatic

   re-admitted with pan-cytopenia of unclear etiology.
   > heme/pancytopenia
 This would appear to be related to global
   impairment of marrow function. The differential for her marrow
   suppression is broad, her corrected retic production index is 0.66
   implying the marrow is not functioning and there is no bandemia. This
   could be related to drug effect (she is on cell-cept, CTX can have this
   side effect or single dose of pip-tazo) in addition she has a hx of CMV
   IgG +, this could represent re-activation of her CMV with bone marrow
   involvement, additional pathogens include, EBV (with hemophagocytic
   syndrome) and parvo-virus. We appreciate the input of the hematology
   team There does not appear to be a bleeding event to explain the drop
   in Hct based on history or exam.  There is also some schistos on periph
   smear although she does not have other components such as renal failure
   (at present) that would argue for a diagnosis of TTP.  Finally, the
   possibility of thrombosis of the portal/splenic vein with worsening
   splenic sequestration will be evaluated by U/S with flow Doppler [**10-16**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy and pancytopenia. The patient's medical history includes a previous liver transplant, significant coagulopathy, low albumin, and malnourishment. The patient is currently being evaluated for a second liver transplant.

24-hour events include the inability to place a central line due to clotting in the right and left internal jugular veins, resulting in the placement of a femoral line. The patient also experienced renal failure, which has been stabilized by withholding Lasix and receiving albumin. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is now awake and oriented to person, place, and time. Medications include lactulose q4h and rifaximin.
2. Pancytopenia: The cause of pancytopenia is unclear, but possible causes include drug effect (such as tacrolimus), CMV reactivation, or other viral infections like EBV or parvo-virus. The patient's corrected reticulocyte production index is 0.66, indicating impaired marrow function without bandemia. Schistocytes were observed on peripheral smear, but there are no other components to suggest a diagnosis of TTP. The possibility of thrombosis of the portal/splenic vein with worsening splenic sequestration will be evaluated"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU. She was initially transferred to the floor from the MICU but was readmitted to the ICU due to pancytopenia, coagulopathy, concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or blood loss. The patient's symptoms include hepatic encephalopathy, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 127/58 to 109/52 mmHg, heart rate between 72-75 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis and liver transplant. She is also being followed by the liver transplant team and is listed for a second transplant. Her blood tests show low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring for pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and concern for DIC, TTP, or blood loss. She is being monitored closely with frequent lab tests to assess her condition. The patient is also receiving lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, rifaximin, and ciprofloxacin for a urinary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, currently admitted to the ICU with resolving hepatic encephalopathy. She has been transferred from the MICU to the floor and then re-admitted due to pancytopenia of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing significant malnourishment, as indicated by her low albumin level. She has a history of CMV IgG positivity, which could indicate reactivation of CMV with bone marrow involvement. Other possible causes of marrow suppression include drug effects (such as CTX or pip-tazo) and viral infections like EBV or parvo-virus. The patient's peripheral smear shows some schistocytes, but there is no evidence of renal failure or other components that would suggest a diagnosis of TTP. Additionally, there is a possibility of thrombosis of the portal/splenic vein with worsening splenic sequestration, evaluated by ultrasound with flow Doppler. The patient has a negative LENI for DVT and positive EBV serology indicating an old infection. Medication changes have been made, including discontinuing cellcept and switching to ciprofloxacin. Further evaluation is needed for CMV, parvo virus serologies, EBV viral load, ferritin levels, cryo-transfusion, PRBC transfusion, platelet transfusion, and HIT ab check. The patient also requires line placement and management"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2232**]. Findings and plan
   reflect our discussion.
   57 year old female with cirrhosis here with resolving hepatic
   encephalopathy and [**Hospital 2111**] transferred to floor from MICU on [**10-14**], now
   re-admitted with pan-cytopenia of unclear etiology.
    > heme/pancytopenia
 This would appear to be related to global
   impairment of marrow function. The differential for her marrow
   suppression is broad, her corrected retic production index is 0.66
   implying the marrow is not functioning and there is no bandemia. This
   could be related to drug effect (she is on cell-cept, CTX can have this
   side effect or single dose of pip-tazo) in addition she has a hx of CMV
   IgG +, this could represent re-activation of her CMV with bone marrow
   involvement, additional pathogens include, EBV (with hemophagocytic
   syndrome) and parvo-virus. We appreciate the input of the hematology
   team There does not appear to be a bleeding event to explain the drop
   in Hct based on history or exam.  There is also some schistos on periph
   smear although she does not have other components such as renal failure
   (at present) that would argue for a diagnosis of TTP.  Finally, the
   possibility of thrombosis of the portal/splenic vein with worsening
   splenic sequestration was evaluated by U/S with flow Doppler [**10-16**]
   hepatic, portal or splenic vein thrombosis or worsening splenomegaly.
   LENI is negative for DVT. EBV serology positive c/w old infection.
   Medication effect possible, med changes have been made as follows: DC
   of cellcept [**10-14**], addition of ceftriaxone [**10-12**] (has hx of
allergy
   to sulfa groups, with sulfur present on ctx molecule). / CTX was
   stopped, now on Ciprofloxacin.
   - F/u CMV, parvo virus serologies
   - Check EBV viral load
   - F/u Ferritin for ? of hemophagocytic syndrome (trig nl)
   - cryo transfusion for fibrinogen <70, prbc for hct <23, plat for <20
   or trend downward
   - F/u check HIT ab
   > Line placement: We
ve been unable to thread the wire through R or L
   IJ. Has a fem line now.
   -PICC in IR on Monday
    > hepatic encephalopathy
 thought triggered by UTI.  Today, she is
   AOx3
   - lactulose q4 hrs
   - cont rifaximin
   - changed ctx to cipro iv (diarrhea significant, question absorption),
   to complete 7d course to end [**10-19**]
   - hold Bactrim given pancytopenia
     > cirrhosis s/p transplant
 being followed by liver transplant,
   being listed for a second transplant.  +significant coaguloapthy, low
   albumin with significant malnourishment, albumin of 2.4.
   - hold cellcept as per E-[**Doctor Last Name **] team, continue tacrolimus (level was = 6
   4 days ago).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and pancytopenia of unclear etiology. She has been treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is currently on multiple medications including ceftriaxone, tacrolimus, and rifaximin. The patient's condition is complicated by potential causes for her pancytopenia, including drug effects, CMV reactivation, EBV infection, or other viral infections. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, liver function tests, and electrolyte levels. She also has schistocytes on peripheral smear. The patient's treatment plan includes discontinuing cellcept, adding ceftriaxone, cryo-transfusion for low fibrinogen, PRBC for low hematocrit, and platelet transfusion for low platelet count. Further investigations are planned to rule out CMV and parvovirus infections, as well as to check for hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient's line placement has been unsuccessful in the internal jugular veins and a femoral line has been placed. She is being followed by the liver transplant team and is awaiting re-transplantation."
