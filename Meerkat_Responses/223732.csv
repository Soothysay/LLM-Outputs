   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p
   allogenic stem cell transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been
   inpatient for last 2mths here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and
   ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt with h/o multiple PNAs & poor resp mechanics
   [**12-30**] to severe skin GVHD causing encasing of the chest wall as well as
   chronically collapsed lower lung. Pt has had nausea, vomiting for the
   last 3 days and was advanced po diet in setting of some MS changes and
   increasing somnolence. Now with low grade fevers & CXR findings c/w new
   RLL pneumonia, productive of bile-laden sputum.  Clinical picture very
   suggestive of new aspiration PNA. VBGs showing hypercarbic resp failure
   and pt with increased resp effort.
   - start Vanc, Meropenem, Tobramycin, Caspofungin
   - f/u ID recs
   - try non-invasive mask ventilation prn
   - f/u blood, urine Cx, sputum culture, am CXR
   - f/u CMV VL and Galactomannin
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia)
   - strict aspiration precautions
   - hold off on thoracentesis for now given the risks outweigh the
   benefits.
   - deep suction if tolerated
   - strict NPO & hold all sedating meds
   .
   # Mental Status changes: Most likely due to hypercarbia. CT head last
   night WNL, so less likely intracranial process despite pupil
   asymmetry.  Pupil asymmetry may also be due to nebs leaking over one
   side of face preferentially. Difficult to assess neuro exam, but
   unchanged overnight.
   - f/u serial VBGs
   - serial neuro exams
   - requiring pain meds, but will limit as much as possible because we do
   not want to dampen respiratory drive so pt. can blow off some c02.
   .
   # Abd pain: Pt with acute on chronic abd pain and new N/V over last 3
   days. Portable abd confirms placement of G-J tube but raises concern
   for early bowel obsruction, patient has history of ileus, and this is
   more likely.  Difficult to obtain abd exam given abd wall skin, but pt
   asking for POs currently & denying abd pain.
   - strict NPO, hold TFs for now
   - restart TPN per nutrition recs
   - consider CT abd to r/o bowel obstruction if worsening
   - if acutely concerned, will eval with KUB.
   .
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u Tacro level
   - f/u BMT recs
   - Due for IVIG at the end of [**Month (only) 705**]
   .
   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s
   currently most likely due to respiratory distress and acute infection.
   Pt denying any CP but ongoing SOB, EKGs unchanged from prior tracings.
   Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x 2 on [**7-16**] & [**7-17**].
   - f/u EKG & cycle CE
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PE: Pt with a history of PE in [**4-5**] currently on systemic
   anticoagulation, CTA negative x 2.
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   #MDD:
   - holding long acting Benzos given AMS
   - Continue remeron and ritalin per psych recs
   - will give short acting Benzo (Ativan) prn

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who has undergone an allogenic stem cell transplant. The patient is currently inpatient for the last two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia (ALS). The patient's recent events include nausea, vomiting, low-grade fevers, and new right lower lobe pneumonia, which is suggestive of a new aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia and respiratory distress with increased effort. 

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory distress due to severe skin graft versus host disease causing encasing of the chest wall as well as chronically collapsed lower lung. The patient has been tried on mask ventilation, but started stacking breaths and refused further mask ventilation. Oxygen saturation remains above 95%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 77 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 91. 

The patient's physical examination reveals anxiety, abdominal breathing, right pupil larger than left, both pupils reactive, crackles throughout the chest with diminished breath sounds at the bases, particularly on the left side. The patient's abdomen is hard and non-tender. Neurologic examination is difficult to assess due to sedation, but there are no focal signs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant in 2005 due to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has been an inpatient for the last two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing low-grade fevers, chest X-ray findings consistent with new right lower lobe pneumonia, and productive bile-laden sputum. His vital signs show tachycardia, and he is anxious with shallow breathing. The patient's mental status is unchanged, and he is somnolent at baseline. Physical examination reveals crackles throughout the chest, diminished breath sounds at the bases, and a hard, non-tender abdomen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of multiple pneumonia and poor respiratory mechanics due to severe skin GVHD causing encasing of the chest wall as well as chronically collapsed lower lung. The clinical picture suggests new aspiration pneumonia.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient is somnolent at baseline, and there may be worsening hypercarbia contributing to his mental status changes. Pupil asymmetry may be due to nebs leaking over one side of the face or GVHD affecting vision.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient has acute on chronic abdominal pain and new nausea/vomiting. The placement of a G-J tube confirms the"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p
   allogenic stem cell transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been
   inpatient for last 2mths here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and
   ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt with h/o multiple PNAs & poor resp mechanics
   [**12-30**] to severe skin GVHD causing encasing of the chest wall as well as
   chronically collapsed lower lung. Pt has had nausea, vomiting for the
   last 3 days and was advanced po diet in setting of some MS changes and
   increasing somnolence. Now with low grade fevers & CXR findings c/w new
   RLL pneumonia, productive of bile-laden sputum.  Clinical picture very
   suggestive of new aspiration PNA. VBGs showing hypercarbic resp failure
   and pt with increased resp effort.  Given the semi-normal pH despite
   severe hypercarbia, likely due to restrictive disease from his GVHD and
   chronically collapsed LLL.  Some acute hypercarbia likely [**12-30**]
   aspiration PNA.
   - Continue Vanc, Meropenem, Tobramycin, Caspofungin
   - f/u ID recs
   - try non-invasive mask ventilation prn, try to get ABG on BIPAP if
   patient tolerates
   - f/u blood, urine Cx, sputum culture, am CXR
   - f/u CMV VL and Galactomannin
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia)
   - strict aspiration precautions
   - hold off on thoracentesis for now given the risks outweigh the
   benefits.
   - deep suction if tolerated
   - strict NPO & hold all sedating meds
   .
   # Mental Status changes: Patient somnolent at baseline, perhaps
   worsened by hypercarbia. CT head last night WNL, so less likely
   intracranial process despite pupil asymmetry.  Pupil asymmetry may also
   be due to nebs leaking over one side of face preferentially or to GVHD
   affecting vision. Difficult to assess neuro exam, but unchanged
   overnight.
   - serial neuro exams
   - requiring pain meds, but will limit as much as possible because we do
   not want to dampen respiratory drive so pt. can blow off some c02.
   .
   # Abd pain: Pt with acute on chronic abd pain and new N/V over last 3
   days. Portable abd confirms placement of G-J tube but raises concern
   for early bowel obsruction, patient has history of ileus, and this is
   more likely.  Difficult to obtain abd exam given abd wall skin. C/o
   abdominal pain this AM, had a bowel movement O/N
   - strict NPO, hold TFs for now
   - restart TPN per nutrition recs
   - if acutely concerned, will eval with KUB.
   - restart bowel regimen
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u Tacro level this AM (has been 6.9)
   - f/u BMT recs
   - Due for IVIG at the end of [**Month (only) 705**]
   .
   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s
   currently most likely due to respiratory distress and acute infection
   and possibly pain. Pt denying any CP but ongoing SOB, EKGs unchanged
   from prior tracings.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x
   2 on [**7-16**] & [**7-17**].
   - CE enzymes negative, EKG unchanged
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PE: Pt with a history of PE in [**4-5**] currently on systemic
   anticoagulation, CTA negative x 2.
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   #MDD:
   - holding long acting Benzos given AMS
   - Continue remeron and ritalin per psych recs
   - will give short acting Benzo (Ativan) prn
   .
   # FEN: strictly NPO for now
   - nutrition consult for TPN
   - monitor lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Access: PICC -one lumen for TPN, so limited access for emergent
   situation.  PIV very difficult to get in this patient.
   -if necessary, IR for PIV or PICC placement
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Lovenox 40mg sc BID, restart bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL

   # Dispo: ICU.  Will need to talk to BMT about the short and long term
   goals of care and prognosis.  Likely close to baseline respiratory
   status.

","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following an allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been inpatient for the past two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). 

The patient's current complaints include tachypnea, persistent hypercarbia, and mental status changes. He is tired and asking to be intubated. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure of 119/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 95%. 

The patient's EKG shows a sinus tachycardia. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new onset nausea and vomiting over the past three days. Physical examination reveals anxious and shallow breathing, bilateral crackles throughout the chest, and bilateral diminished breath sounds. Neurologic examination shows attentive and oriented behavior. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.2 g/dL, platelet count of 763 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels within normal range. Other labs indicate elevated lactic acid levels and low magnesium levels. 

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory distress due to severe skin GVHD causing encasing of the chest wall and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress, pneumonia, ventilatory failure.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial.  Pneumonia, LLL atalectasis (chronic,
   persistent),restrictive disease (chest wall thickening and limited
   excurtion).  Continue antimicrobials.  Poor tolerance of non-invasive
   ventilation.  Offer non-invasive ventilation, consider intubation if
   decompensates (progressive acidemia or hypercapnea), but at high risk
   for ventilator dependence.  Need to better define goals of care.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- somnulance attributed to sedatives, also
   contribution from hypercapnea (ventilatory failure).  Remains

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 137 bpm, blood pressure of 120/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's current respiratory support consists of non-invasive ventilation.

The patient has a history of pneumonia, left lower lobe atelectasis, restrictive lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They are also experiencing altered mental status, likely due to sedatives and hypercapnea. Additionally, the patient has pleural effusion, panic attacks, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), tachycardia, and fluid hypovolemia.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), increased platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab results include elevated lactate, normal calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing antimicrobials for pneumonia, attempting therapeutic left thoracentesis for pleural effusion, offering non-invasive ventilation and considering intubation if needed, maintaining sedation, managing GVHD, and addressing fluid hypovolemia.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress, pneumonia, ventilatory failure.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial.  Pneumonia, LLL atalectasis (chronic,
   persistent),restrictive disease (chest wall thickening and limited
   excurtion).  Continue antimicrobials.  Poor tolerance of non-invasive
   ventilation.  Offer non-invasive ventilation, consider intubation if
   decompensates (progressive acidemia or hypercapnea), but at high risk
   for ventilator dependence.  Need to better define goals of care.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- somnulance attributed to sedatives, also
   contribution from hypercapnea (ventilatory failure).  Remains
   appropriate.  Monitor closely.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION
 plan attempt at therapeutic left thoracentesis,
   hopefully will contribute to improved ventilation (perhaps re-expand
   LLL).
   LLL ATALECTASIS
 persistent and progressive since [**5-6**].  Suspect
   likelihood of reexpansion low, but may be of benefit if achieved.
   Maintaining reexpansion will be challenging due to restrictive
   physiology.
   PANIC ATTACKS -- continue pharmacological mangement.
   GVHD -- extensive disease of skin and GI tract.  Continue medications.
   TACHYCARDIA -- somewhat higher than baseline, related to pain,
   hypoxemia.
   PNEUMONIA -- RLL, likely due to aspiration.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia;  replete.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Resume TF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pneumonia, left lower lobe atelectasis (chronic and persistent), restrictive lung disease (chest wall thickening and limited excursion), and has been on mechanical ventilation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator dependence: The patient may develop a dependency on mechanical ventilation, which can prolong the duration of ICU stay and increase the risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at increased risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection.
3. Barotrauma: The patient's restrictive lung disease and chest wall thickening increase the risk of barotrauma, which is lung injury caused by high pressures during ventilation.
4. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing infections, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
5. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's critical illness and organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and coagulopathy, can lead to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), where multiple organs fail due to systemic inflammation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress, pneumonia, ventilatory failure.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial.  Pneumonia, LLL atalectasis (chronic,
   persistent),restrictive disease (chest wall thickening and limited
   excurtion).  Poor tolerance of non-invasive ventilation.  Offer
   non-invasive ventilation, consider intubation if decompensates, but
   suspect will likely remain ventilator dependent.  Need to better define
   goals.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- somnulance attributed to sedatives, also
   contribution from hypercapnea (ventilatory failure).
   PANIC ATTACKS -- continue pharmacological  .
   GVHD -- extensive disease of skin and GI tract.  Continue medications.
   TACHYCARDIA -- somewhat higher than baseline, related to pain,
   hypoxemia.
   PNEUMONIA -- RLL, likely due to aspiration.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia;  replete.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Resume TF.

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt with h/o multiple PNAs & poor resp mechanics
   [**12-30**] to severe skin GVHD causing encasing of the chest wall as well as
   chronically collapsed lower lung. Now with low grade fevers & CXR
   findings c/w new RLL pneumonia, productive of bile-laden sputum.
   Clinical picture very suggestive of new aspiration PNA. VBGs showing
   hypercarbic resp failure and pt with increased resp effort.  Given the
   semi-normal pH despite severe hypercarbia, likely due to restrictive
   disease from his GVHD and chronically collapsed LLL.  Some acute
   hypercarbia likely [**12-30**] aspiration PNA. Patient intubated and sedated.
   - Continue Vanc, Meropenem, Tobramycin, Caspofungin
   -consider thoracentesis today as this may increase respiratory
   comfort.  Patient is sedated, and will unlikely be able sit up for
   procedure. IP is aware of him. Lovenox held today in anticipation of
   procedure.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine Cx, sputum culture, am CXR
   - f/u CMV VL and Galactomannin
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia)
   - strict aspiration precautions
   - deep suction if tolerated
   - strict NPO & hold all sedating meds
    .
   # Mental Status changes: Patient somnolent at baseline, perhaps
   worsened by hypercarbia. CT head WNL, so less likely intracranial
   process despite pupil asymmetry.  Pupil asymmetry may also be due to
   nebs leaking over one side of face preferentially or to GVHD affecting
   vision. Difficult to assess neuro exam, but unchanged overnight.
   Patient is sedated, but arousable currently.
   -continue fentanyl and versed for patient comfort
   .
   # Abd pain: Pt with acute on chronic abd pain and new N/V over last 3
   days. Portable abd confirms placement of G-J tube but raises concern
   for early bowel obsruction, patient has history of ileus, and this is
   more likely.  Difficult to obtain abd exam given abd wall skin. +BM
   yesterday
   - strict NPO, hold TFs for now
   - restart TPN per nutrition recs
   - if acutely concerned, will eval with KUB.
   - restart bowel regimen
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**6-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u Tacro level this AM (has been 6.9)
   - f/u BMT recs
   - Due for IVIG at the end of [**Month (only) 705**]
   .
   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s
   currently most likely due to respiratory distress and acute infection
   and possibly pain. Pt denying any CP but ongoing SOB, EKGs unchanged
   from prior tracings.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x
   2 on [**7-16**] & [**7-17**]. Already anticoagulated.
   - CE enzymes negative, EKG unchanged
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PE: Pt with a history of PE in [**4-5**] currently on systemic
   anticoagulation, CTA negative x 2.
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   #MDD: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given AMS
   - Continue remeron and ritalin per psych recs
   - will give short acting Benzo (Ativan) prn
   .
   # FEN: strictly NPO for now
   - nutrition consult for TPN
   - monitor lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Access: PICC -one lumen for TPN, so limited access for emergent
   situation.  PIV very difficult to get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement needed
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Lovenox 40mg sc BID, restart bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL -discuss goals of care with family today, and clarify code
   status.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Will need to talk to BMT about the short and long term
   goals of care and prognosis.  Likely close to baseline respiratory

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following an allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been admitted to the hospital for the past two months due to hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute lung injury. The patient's current condition includes low-grade fevers, new right lower lobe pneumonia, and productive bile-laden sputum, which is suggestive of a new aspiration pneumonia. He is intubated and sedated.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging studies reveal no evidence of small bowel obstruction but indicate new right lower lobe pneumonia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin, meropenem, tobramycin, and caspofungin. He is also being considered for a thoracentesis, which may increase respiratory comfort. Other ongoing treatments include strict aspiration precautions, deep suctioning if tolerated, and strict nothing by mouth (NPO) status with the intention to restart total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's mental status changes are attributed to hypercarbia, and there is a concern for potential intracranial processes, although the CT head is normal. Pupil asymmetry may be due to nebulizer leakage or GVHD affecting vision.

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt with h/o multiple PNAs & poor resp mechanics
   [**12-30**] to severe skin GVHD causing encasing of the chest wall as well as
   chronically collapsed lower lung. Pt has had nausea, vomiting for the
   last 3 days and was advanced po diet in setting of some MS changes and
   increasing somnolence. Now with low grade fevers & CXR findings c/w new
   RLL pneumonia, productive of bile-laden sputum.  Clinical picture very
   suggestive of new aspiration PNA. VBGs showing hypercarbic resp failure
   and pt with increased resp effort.  Given the semi-normal pH despite
   severe hypercarbia, likely due to restrictive disease from his GVHD and
   chronically collapsed LLL.  Some acute hypercarbia likely [**12-30**]
   aspiration PNA. Patient intubated and sedated.
   - Continue Vanc, Meropenem, Tobramycin, Caspofungin
   -consider thoracentesis today as this may increase respiratory
   comfort.  Patient is sedated, and will unlikely be able sit up for
   procedure.
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine Cx, sputum culture, am CXR
   - f/u CMV VL and Galactomannin
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia)
   - strict aspiration precautions
   - deep suction if tolerated
   - strict NPO & hold all sedating meds
    .
   # Mental Status changes: Patient somnolent at baseline, perhaps
   worsened by hypercarbia. CT head WNL, so less likely intracranial
   process despite pupil asymmetry.  Pupil asymmetry may also be due to
   nebs leaking over one side of face preferentially or to GVHD affecting
   vision. Difficult to assess neuro exam, but unchanged overnight.
   Patient is sedated, but arousable currently.
   -continue fentanyl and versed for patient comfort
   .
   # Abd pain: Pt with acute on chronic abd pain and new N/V over last 3
   days. Portable abd confirms placement of G-J tube but raises concern
   for early bowel obsruction, patient has history of ileus, and this is
   more likely.  Difficult to obtain abd exam given abd wall skin. +BM
   yesterday
   - strict NPO, hold TFs for now
   - restart TPN per nutrition recs
   - if acutely concerned, will eval with KUB.
   - restart bowel regimen
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**6-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u Tacro level this AM (has been 6.9)
   - f/u BMT recs
   - Due for IVIG at the end of [**Month (only) 705**]
   .
   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s
   currently most likely due to respiratory distress and acute infection
   and possibly pain. Pt denying any CP but ongoing SOB, EKGs unchanged
   from prior tracings.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x
   2 on [**7-16**] & [**7-17**].
   - CE enzymes negative, EKG unchanged
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PE: Pt with a history of PE in [**4-5**] currently on systemic
   anticoagulation, CTA negative x 2.
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   #MDD: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given AMS
   - Continue remeron and ritalin per psych recs
   - will give short acting Benzo (Ativan) prn
   .
   # FEN: strictly NPO for now
   - nutrition consult for TPN
   - monitor lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Access: PICC -one lumen for TPN, so limited access for emergent
   situation.  PIV very difficult to get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement needed
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Lovenox 40mg sc BID, restart bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL -discuss goals of care with family today, and clarify code
   status.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Will need to talk to BMT about the short and long term
   goals of care and prognosis.  Likely close to baseline respiratory
   status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who has undergone an allogenic stem cell transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is experiencing multiple medical complications.

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress, which is secondary to restrictive lung disease caused by GVHD skin thickening, chronic left lower lobe atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. The patient has been intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/61 mmHg to 132/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurologic status is somnolent but arousable, and there is an asymmetry in the pupils, which may be due to nebulizer leakage or GVHD affecting vision. The patient's mental status changes are likely worsened by hypercarbia, and a CT scan of the head showed no intracranial process.

The patient's abdominal pain resolved after passing three bowel movements yesterday, and there is no evidence of small bowel obstruction on imaging. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals for suspected infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ventilatory failure, multifactorial.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Pneumonia, pleural effusion,
   LLL atalectasis, restrictive physiology (although pressures not
   severely high).  Contribution of benzodiazepines (sedation).  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Aim for pH 7.30-7.35.  Hope to
   assess preparedness for extubation once thoracentesis performed, LLL
   atalectasis, left pleural effusion improved.  Hope to identify
   reversible process.  Discussion with wife, no desire for chronic
   tracheotomy tube placement and chronic ventilation.  Bronchoscopy to
   assess airway patency and sample resp. secretions.
   HYPOTENSION -- transient, likely related to intubation/pharmacological
   agents.
   Left PLEURAL EFFUSION -- plan therapeutic thoracentesis (IP service to
   perform).
   LLL ATALECTASIS -- consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   ANXIETY -- continue benzodiazepine infusion.  Continue other meds as
   per Psychiatry.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.  PICC.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has been intubated for respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pleural effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, restrictive physiology, and sedation from benzodiazepines. Mechanical ventilation will continue, with monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG) to aim for a pH of 7.30-7.35. Once the thoracentesis is performed, improvement in the left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis, the readiness for extubation will be assessed.

The patient also experienced transient hypotension, which was likely related to intubation and pharmacological agents. This has responded to intravenous fluid boluses.

There is a left pleural effusion, for which therapeutic thoracentesis is planned. Bronchoscopy will be performed to assess airway patency and sample respiratory secretions.

The patient is anxious, and the benzodiazepine infusion will be continued. Other medications will be continued as per Psychiatry.

The patient's fluids are euvolemic, and I/O will be monitored to maintain a balance. A PICC line has been placed.

Nutrition support will be provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to the inability to take oral intake. Glycemic control will be maintained with regular insulin sliding scale.

Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with boots and systemic antico"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, and restrictive physiology. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and the plan is to continue monitoring ABG levels and aiming for a pH of 7.30-7.35. Once the thoracentesis is performed to address the left pleural effusion, and the left lower lobe atelectasis improves, the healthcare team hopes to assess the patient's preparedness for extubation.

The patient also experienced transient hypotension, which was likely related to intubation and pharmacological agents. This has resolved with the administration of IV fluid boluses.

Additionally, the patient has a left pleural effusion, for which therapeutic thoracentesis is planned. Bronchoscopy will be considered to assess airway patency and sample respiratory secretions.

The patient is also being treated for anxiety with a benzodiazepine infusion and will continue to receive medications as per Psychiatry.

Fluid management is important, and the patient will be maintained in a euvolemic state with close monitoring of I/O balance. A PICC line has been placed.

Regarding nutritional support, tube feeds have been initiated, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) will be held temporarily.

In terms of prophylaxis, the patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis"

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  secondary to 1. restrictive lung disease [**12-30**]
   GVHD skin thickening  2. chronic LLL atelectasis   3.  Pleural
   effusions  4.  RLL aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.  Patient
   intubated and sedated.
   - Continue Vanc (day 1 [**7-25**]), Meropenem (day 1 [**7-25**]), Tobramycin (day 1
   [**7-25**]), empiric Caspofungin (day 1 [**7-24**])
   -Thoracentesis today as this may increase respiratory comfort.  Patient
   is sedated, and will unlikely be able sit up for procedure. IP is aware
   of him. Lovenox held today in anticipation of procedure.  Send pleural
   fluid for bacterial, fungal, AFB stain and culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4843**],
   Viral culture
   -bronchoscopy today in attempt to open LLL atelectasis
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia
   .
   # Mental Status changes: Patient somnolent at baseline, perhaps
   worsened by hypercarbia. CT head WNL, so less likely intracranial
   process despite pupil asymmetry.  Pupil asymmetry may also be due to
   nebs leaking over one side of face preferentially or to GVHD affecting
   vision. Difficult to assess neuro exam, but unchanged overnight.
   Patient is sedated, but arousable currently.
   -continue fentanyl and versed for patient comfort
   -daily wakeups
   -consider MRI to investigate cause of new anisocoria  -touch base with
   heme/onc regarding further imaging
   .
   # Abd pain: KUB shows no evidence of SBO.  Difficult to obtain abd exam
   given abd wall skin. +BMx3 yesterday. Resolved.
   - restart TFs per nutrition recs
   - continue bowel regimen
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**6-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u Tacro level yesterday AM (has been 6.9)
   - f/u BMT recs
   - Due for IVIG [**7-28**]
   .
   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s
   currently most likely due to respiratory distress and acute infection
   and possibly pain. Pt denying any CP but ongoing SOB, EKGs unchanged
   from prior tracings.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x
   2 on [**7-16**] & [**7-17**]. Already anticoagulated
   - CE enzymes negative, EKG unchanged
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
held this AM in anticipation of
   thoracentesis
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given AMS
   - Continue remeron and ritalin per psych recs
   - will give short acting Benzo (Ativan) prn
   .
   # FEN: restart TFs
   - monitor lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Access: PICC -one lumen for TPN, so limited access for emergent
   situation.  PIV very difficult to get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement needed
not essential today, but will
   need to address this within the next few days.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Lovenox 40mg sc BID, restart bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL -discuss goals of care with family today, and clarify code
   status.  Family okay with trial of intubation, but [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following an allogenic stem cell transplant. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for the past two months due to hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute lung injury (ALI). He has been intubated and sedated.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has restrictive lung disease due to GVHD skin thickening, chronic left lower lobe (LLL) atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right lower lobe (RLL) aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 96 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%.

2. Mental Status Changes: The patient is somnolent at baseline, possibly worsened by hypercarbia. A CT scan of the head shows no intracranial process. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  secondary to 1. restrictive lung disease [**12-30**]
   GVHD skin thickening  2. chronic LLL atelectasis   3.  Pleural
   effusions  4.  RLL aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.  Patient
   intubated and sedated.
   - Continue Vanc (day 1 [**7-25**]), Meropenem (day 1 [**7-25**]), Tobramycin (day 1
   [**7-25**]), empiric Caspofungin (day 1 [**7-24**])
   - Daily RSBI and SBT
   - Daily wake ups
   - pleural effusion largely reaccumulated 1 day after [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - Diurese 1L today
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia
   .
   # Mental Status changes: Patient somnolent at baseline, perhaps
   worsened by hypercarbia. CT head WNL, so less likely intracranial
   process despite pupil asymmetry.  Pupil asymmetry may also be due to
   nebs leaking over one side of face preferentially or to GVHD affecting
   vision. Difficult to assess neuro exam, but unchanged overnight.
   Patient is sedated.
   -continue fentanyl and versed for patient comfort
   -daily wakeups
   - heme/onc defered any further imaging
   .
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u Tacro level yesterday AM (has been 6.9)
   - f/u BMT recs

   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s when
   agitated.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x 2 on [**7-16**] &
   [**7-17**]. Already anticoagulated
   - CE enzymes negative, EKG unchanged
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given intubation
   - Continue remeron per psych recs

   # Access: 2 lumen PICC -one lumen for blood or other continuous
   infusion, so limited access for emergent situation.  PIV very difficult
   to get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement needed
not essential today, but will

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a past medical history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after an allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been in the hospital for two months and is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress, likely secondary to restrictive lung disease due to GVHD skin thickening, chronic left lower lobe atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia.

The patient was intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute respiratory failure. He is sedated and on mechanical ventilation. The respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and autoflow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 29 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate (HR) of 127 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 115/73 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after an allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been admitted to the ICU for the past two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute lung injury syndrome (ALS). He is intubated and sedated.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory distress due to restrictive lung disease, chronic left lower lobe atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.
2. Mental status changes, possibly worsened by hypercarbia. Pupil asymmetry may be due to nebs leaking over one side of the face or GVHD affecting vision.
3. GVHD, which requires continuous immunosuppressive therapy.
4. Tachycardia, which has been evaluated for pulmonary embolism but is negative. The patient is already anticoagulated and on telemetry monitoring.
5. Major depressive disorder, being managed by psychiatry.
6. Poor venous access, with a difficult peripheral intravenous (PIV) line and a two-lumen peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line with limited access for emergent situations.
7. Pressure ulcer prevention and management.
8. Potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.
10. Code status discussion with the family regarding full code or do not resuscitate (DNR) status."

   -disconintued Meropenem (day 1 [**7-25**]), Tobramycin (day 1 [**7-25**]) per ID
   and BMT
   - Daily RSBI and SBT
continue to wean from vent
   - obtain Vanc trough
   - pleural effusion largely reaccumulated 1 day after [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - Diurese 1L today
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia

   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s when
   agitated.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x 2 on [**7-16**] &
   [**7-17**]. Already anticoagulated. Overnight had episode in 200s, consistent
   with aflutter. Unclear of underlying cause. Most likely [**12-30**] to acute
   illness, fevers, and electrolyte changes.
   - CE enzymes negative
   -restart prior dose of Lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient somnolent at baseline, perhaps
   worsened by hypercarbia. CT head WNL, so less likely intracranial
   process despite pupil asymmetry.  Pupil asymmetry may also be due to
   nebs leaking over one side of face preferentially or to GVHD affecting
   vision. Difficult to assess neuro exam, but arousable this AM. Patient
   is sedated.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005. He is currently in the ICU due to severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) and has been an inpatient for the past two months. The patient's main issues include respiratory distress, tachycardia, mental status changes, and GVHD.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has restrictive lung disease caused by GVHD skin thickening, chronic left lower lobe atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis. These factors contribute to his respiratory distress, which requires intubation and sedation.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has a baseline heart rate in the 110s, which increases to the 130s when agitated. This tachycardia could be due to acute illness, fevers, and electrolyte changes. It may also be related to the patient's underlying condition, such as GVHD or infections.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient is somnolent at baseline and may have worsened mental status due to hypercarbia. While the CT head is normal, there is a possibility of an intracranial process. The patient's pupil asymmetry may be caused by ne"

   # Respiratory Distress:  secondary to 1. restrictive lung disease [**12-30**]
   GVHD skin thickening  2. chronic LLL atelectasis   3.  Pleural
   effusions  4.  RLL aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.  Patient
   intubated and sedated.
   - Increase Vanc (day 1 [**7-25**]) based on trough
   - continue Caspofungin (day 1 [**7-24**])
   - Meropenem (day 1 [**7-25**]) continued per BMT attending given
   immunocompromised pt
   -disconintued Tobramycin (day 1 [**7-25**]) per ID and BMT
   - Daily RSBI and SBT - ABG this AM on PS 15/5 was 7.36/81/75/48
   - Will keep pt on AC overnight for rest and increase rate to achieve
   PCO2 in the 60-70 range
   -ABG at noon today
   - pleural effusion largely reaccumulated 1 day after [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - Diurese 500cc to 1L today
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia)
   .
   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s when
   agitated.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x 2 on [**7-16**] &
   [**7-17**]. Already anticoagulated. Had episode of a-flutter in 200s on
   [**2170-7-28**]. Unclear of underlying cause. Most likely [**12-30**] to acute illness,
   fevers, and electrolyte changes.
   - CE enzymes negative
   - Consider titrating up Lopressor  today if BP tolerates
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient somnolent at baseline, perhaps
   worsened by hypercarbia. CT head WNL.  ? Pupil asymmetry -> resolved.
   Difficult to assess neuro exam, but arousable this AM. Patient is
   sedated.
   -continue fentanyl and versed for patient comfort
   -daily wakeups
   - heme/onc defered any further imaging
   .
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u Tacro level today (has been 6.9)
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given intubation
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - d/c ritalin
   .
   # FEN: continue slow titration of TFs.
   - monitor lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Access: 2 lumen PICC
 TPA for clogged lumen.  PIV very difficult to
   get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement if needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Lovenox 60mg sc BID, restart bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL .  Family okay with trial of intubation, but [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma, status post allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005 complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has been an inpatient for the last two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute lung injury syndrome (ALS) aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/62 mmHg to 121/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals sinus tachycardia, bilateral anterior chest wall fibrosis, firm abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no peripheral edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 46 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues. Firstly, he has restrictive lung disease secondary to GVHD skin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005 and is currently being treated for severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient has been an inpatient for the past two months and was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute lung injury syndrome (ALS) due to aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress secondary to restrictive lung disease caused by GVHD skin thickening, chronic left lower lobe atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate in the 110s, blood pressure ranging from 101/62 mmHg to 121/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including vancomycin, caspofungin, tobramycin, meropenem, fentanyl, midazolam, enoxaparin, and others. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and serum albumin levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  secondary to 1. restrictive lung disease [**12-30**]
   GVHD skin thickening  2. chronic LLL atelectasis   3.  Pleural
   effusions  4.  RLL aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.  Patient
   intubated and sedated.
   - Increase Vanc (day 1 [**7-25**]) based on trough
   - continue Caspofungin (day 1 [**7-24**])
   -disconintued Meropenem (day 1 [**7-25**]), Tobramycin (day 1 [**7-25**]) per ID
   and BMT
   - Daily RSBI and SBT
continue to wean from vent
   - pleural effusion largely reaccumulated 1 day after [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - Atrovent nebs 3hrs (holding Albuterol for tachycardia)
   .
   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s when
   agitated.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x 2 on [**7-16**] &
   [**7-17**]. Already anticoagulated. Had episode of a-flutter in 200s. Unclear
   of underlying cause. Most likely [**12-30**] to acute illness, fevers, and
   electrolyte changes.
   - CE enzymes negative
   - Continue Lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient somnolent at baseline, perhaps
   worsened by hypercarbia. CT head WNL, so less likely intracranial
   process despite pupil asymmetry.  Pupil asymmetry may also be due to
   nebs leaking over one side of face preferentially or to GVHD affecting
   vision. Difficult to assess neuro exam, but arousable this AM. Patient
   is sedated.
   -continue fentanyl and versed for patient comfort
   -daily wakeups
   - heme/onc defered any further imaging
   .
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u Tacro level yesterday AM (has been 6.9)
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given intubation
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - d/c ritalin
   .
   # FEN: continue slow titration of TFs. Continue to keep net fluid even.
   - monitor lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Access: 2 lumen PICC .  PIV very difficult to get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement if needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Lovenox 60mg sc BID, restart bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL .  Family okay with trial of intubation, but [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) post-allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been an inpatient for the last two months due to hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute lung syndrome. The patient was previously admitted for aspiration pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Distress: secondary to restrictive lung disease due to GVHD skin thickening, chronic left lower lobe atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   - Increase Vancomycin (day 1 [**7-25**]) based on trough levels.
   - Continue Caspofungin (day 1 [**7-24**]).
   - Discontinue Meropenem (day 1 [**7-25**]), Tobramycin (day 1 [**7-25**]) per ID and BMT.
   - Daily respiratory system assessment and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to continue weaning from the ventilator.
   - Pleural effusion largely reaccumulated one day after [**Female First Name (un) **].

2. Tachycardia: baseline heart rate in the 110s per primary team, rate in the 130s when agitated. The patient has been worked up for pulmonary embolism with negative CT angiography x 2 on [**7"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005 and is currently experiencing severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has been admitted to the hospital for the past two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated and sedated.

Potential medical complications:
1. Restrictive lung disease due to GVHD skin thickening.
2. Chronic left lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Pleural effusions.
4. Right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.
5. Tachycardia with a baseline heart rate in the 110s, possibly due to acute illness, fevers, and electrolyte changes.
6. Atrial flutter episode overnight, potentially related to acute illness, fevers, and electrolyte changes.
7. Mental status changes, including somnolence and pupil asymmetry, which may be attributed to hypercarbia, nebs leaking over one side of the face, or GVHD affecting vision.
8. Potential intracranial process, although CT head is normal.
9. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring ongoing medication regimen per BMT.
10. Major depressive disorder being managed by psychiatry.
11. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance requiring careful monitoring and management.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B cell lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) and is now experiencing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He was admitted to the ICU on day 5 for hypercapnic failure due to atelectasis, pleural effusion, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is currently on assist-control ventilation (ACV). He is also receiving various medications including tobramycin, caspofungin, acyclovir, meropenem, vancomycin, enoxaparin, methylprednisolone, atovaquone, cellcept, lansoprazole, remeron, humalog, colace, alb MDI, atrov, and lopressor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation. There is a concern about the rising CO2 levels, so the ventilator mode will be switched from PSV to ACV. Short spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) may improve the patient's condition.
2. Aflutter (Atrial Fibrillation): The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has not recurred since being on metoprolol.
3. GVHD: The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for treatment of"

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic failure due to atelectasis, pleural effusion, and aspergillus pneumonia (asp PNA).

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/55 mmHg to 139/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV (continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation) with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance at 21.4 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and altered electrolyte levels including low potassium and magnesium levels.

   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Multifactorial in the setting of restrictive
   lung diseases due to chronic GVHD changes, aspiration pneumonia (S.
   aureus) and/or pneumonities. Patient intubated with sedation, but
   awake.
   -          Continue Vancomycin (day 7)
   -          Continue Caspofungin (day 7)
   -          Check I/O, targer net balance ~0cc
   -          Atrovent nebs PRN
   -          Check spontaneous breathing test today; may be able to
   extubate
   # Tachycardia: Baseline HR in 110s per primary team, rate in 130s when
   agitated.  Pt has been worked up for PE with negative CTA x 2 on [**7-16**] &
   [**7-17**]. Already anticoagulated. Had episode of a-flutter in 200s on
   [**2170-7-28**]. Unclear of underlying cause. Most likely [**12-30**] to acute illness,
   fevers, and electrolyte changes.
   - Consider titrating up Lopressor  today if BP tolerates
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient much more awake compare to prior
   notes, however still on fentanyl and midazolam.
   -continue fentanyl and versed for patient comfort
   -daily wakeups
   - heme/onc defered any further imaging
   .
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u BMT recs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005. He is currently admitted to the ICU for the past two months due to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), hypercarbic respiratory distress, and aspiration pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 99 bpm (with a range of 90-131 bpm), blood pressure of 85/52 mmHg (with a range of 60-139/77 mmHg), respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (with a range of 7-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated but awake.

The patient's recent interventions include changing ventilation settings to assist-control mode, administering an extra diuretic dose, and stopping meropenem on day 6. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, vancomycin, caspofungin, acyclovir, furosemide, and others.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, normal creatinine, and various electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies such as computed tomography angiography ("

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   resolving pneumonia, restrictive pneumopathy in the setting of
   restrictive lung disease (GVHD skin changes), pneumonities, BOOP in the
   setting of GVHD and sedation. Metabolic alkalosis and high SpO2 may be
   contributing to the respiratory distress. The most likely etiologies
   are prior pneumonia and over-sedation. The high dose of midazolam and
   fentanyl are certainly not helping to extubation.
   -          Continue Vancomycin (day 7)
   -          Continue Caspofungin (day 7)
   -          Check I/O, targer net balance -500cc
   -          Atrovent nebs PRN
   -          Check spontaneous breathing test today; may be able to
   extubate
   -          Replete K; target 4.5.
   -          Talk with psychiatry about re-starting Ritalin, which may
   help to awake him and stimulate breathing
   -          Change target SpO2 to 90-95% instead of the 98-100%
   -          Deacrease fentanyl and midazolan
   -          Start Oxycodone for pain control
   -          Change FiO2 to 35% today
   # Pneumonia: Patient  is afebrile and with lower FiO2 requirements.
   Physical exam improved compared to prior nots. Currently on day 7 of
   vancomycin. Meropenem was stopped yesterday.
   -          Continue Vancomycin for 2 more days (Day [**6-7**])
   -          Vancomycin level tonight
   -          F/u ID recs
   # Tachycardia: Patient anemic, with resolving pneumonia and electrolyte
   imbalance as possible etiologies of her tachycardia. Patient has been
   in the 90
s most of the time.
   - Consider titrating up Lopressor  today if BP tolerates
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient much more awake compare to prior
   notes, however still on fentanyl and midazolam.
   - Decrease fentanyl
   - Decrease midazolam
     Start oxycodone for pain control
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005 and is currently experiencing severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has been admitted to the ICU for the past two months due to hypercarbic respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia. His current condition includes respiratory distress, pneumonia, restrictive lung disease caused by GVHD skin changes, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) due to GVHD, and over-sedation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely multifactorial, including resolving pneumonia, restrictive pneumopathy, pneumonitis, and BOOP. Metabolic alkalosis and high SpO2 may also contribute to the respiratory distress. Prior pneumonia and over-sedation are the most likely etiologies.

2. Pneumonia: The patient is afebrile, and his FiO2 requirements have decreased. Physical exam improvements indicate that he is responding to the current treatment of vancomycin. Continue vancomycin for two more days and monitor vancomycin levels.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be caused by anemia, resolving pneumonia, and electrolyte imbalance. Consider titrating up Lopressor if blood pressure tolerates and monitor on telemetry.

4. Mental Status Changes: The patient is more"

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has been in the hospital for about two months and was recently transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated on 8/28 and diagnosed with pneumonia. He remains on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/73 mmHg to 85/52 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute with spontaneous respiration not observed, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 62 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 235.

Physical examination reveals symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, non-tender and distended abdomen, and unassessed skin and neurologic status. Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 474 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 546, elevated creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels ranging from 116 to 175 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits or show minimal abnormalities.

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Patient with stable O2 and pressure requirements, but patient still
   with very small tidal volumes. He is very awake and cooperating.
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  We will need to re-assess for
   tracheostomy and long-term goals.
   -Check I/O; target balance close to cero
   -Atrovent nebs PRN
   -F/u bicarb
   # Pneumonia: Patient doing better from the respiratory point of view.
   CXR improved.
   -          Vancomycin (day 3); Day 1 is the firtst one with therapeutic
   level.
   -          Decrease FiO2
   # Pain control: Patient currently on Fentanyl, being wean out. Was
   started on morphine yesterday.
   -          Increase methadone to 10mg today.
   # Tachycardia: Patient anemic, with resolving pneumonia and electrolyte
   imbalance as possible etiologies of her tachycardia. Patient has been
   in the 90
s most of the time.
   - Consider titrating up Lopressor  today if BP tolerates
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient much more awake compare to prior
   notes, however still on fentanyl and midazolam.
   - Decrease fentanyl
   - Decrease midazolam
   - Increase methadone for pain control
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - Tacrolimus dose was decreased in half, becapuse patient with
   posaconasol
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given intubation
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - Ask psychiatry if ok to restart ritalyn
   .
   # FEN: TF were stopped in the setting of anticipation of possible
   extubation today. Yesterday they were re-started after the failed
   attempt, but patient became nauseous.
   -          Re-start tube feeds slower than yesterday
   -          Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Access: 2 lumen PICC
 TPA for clogged lumen.  PIV very difficult to
   get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement if needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Lovenox 60mg sc BID, restart bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after an allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been admitted to the ICU for the past two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute lung syndrome (ALS). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin caused by GVHD. His recent vitals show a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/55 to 135/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a temperature of 37.4°C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including pneumonia and restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin from GVHD. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential need for tracheostomy.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk of worsening pneumonia, especially since he is on mechanical ventilation. Monitoring the patient's response to antibiotics and adjusting the treatment accordingly is crucial.
3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory distress, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly. Close monitoring of his CO2 levels and adjusting ventilator settings are necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress in the setting of pneumonia and restrictive lung disease. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include vancomycin trough level of 19.9, which prompted redosing. The patient vomited after starting tube feeds, so tube feeds were stopped. No change in tacrolimus dose was made by the oncology team. The ID team recommended changing caspofungin to posaconazole. Methadone was restarted for pain control.

The patient has allergies to no known drugs. The last dose of antibiotics was given on 07/30 at 07:32 PM (Meropenem), 07/30 at 08:12 PM (Caspofungin), and 08/01 at 12:00 AM (Vancomycin).

Infusions include fentanyl at 80 mcg/hour and midazolam (Versed) at 0.5 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include enoxaparin (Lovenox) started on 07/31 at 08:00 PM and midazolam (Versed) stopped on 07/31 at 10:05 PM. Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of 08/01/2170 06:42 AM shows vital signs with Tcurrent 36.6 C (97.8 F), HR 108 bpm, BP 105/55 mmHg, RR 14 insp/min, SpO2 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is SR (Sinus Rhythm). Fluid balance shows a total in of 2,415 mL, including 425 mL PO, 473 mL TF, and 1,632 mL IVF. Total out is 2,533 mL, including 370 mL blood products, 2,483 mL urine, and 50 mL NG. Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, Vt set at 450 mL, RR set at 14, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%, RSBI 131, PIP 31 cmH2O, plateau pressure 24 cmH2O, and SpO2 95%.

   Assessment and Plan
   THIS IS A PRELIMINARY NOTE FOR ROUNDS USE ONLY
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   resolving pneumonia, restrictive pneumopathy in the setting of
   restrictive lung disease (GVHD skin changes), pneumonities, BOOP in the
   setting of GVHD and sedation. Metabolic alkalosis and high SpO2 may be
   contributing to the respiratory distress. The most likely etiologies
   are prior pneumonia and over-sedation. The high dose of midazolam and
   fentanyl are certainly not helping to extubation.
   -          Continue Vancomycin (day 7)
   -          Continue Caspofungin (day 7)
   -          Check I/O, targer net balance -500cc
   -          Atrovent nebs PRN
   -          Check spontaneous breathing test today; may be able to
   extubate
   -          Replete K; target 4.5.
   -          Talk with psychiatry about re-starting Ritalin, which may
   help to awake him and stimulate breathing
   -          Change target SpO2 to 90-95% instead of the 98-100%
   -          Deacrease fentanyl and midazolan
   -          Start Oxycodone for pain control
   -          Change FiO2 to 35% today
   # Pneumonia: Patient  is afebrile and with lower FiO2 requirements.

   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Patient with stable O2 and pressure requirements, but patient still
   with very small tidal volumes. He is very awake and cooperating.
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.
   -Check I/O; target balance close to cero
   Most likely multifactorial in the setting of resolving pneumonia,
   restrictive pneumopathy in the setting of restrictive lung disease
   (GVHD skin changes), pneumonities, BOOP in the setting of GVHD and
   sedation. Metabolic alkalosis and high SpO2 may be contributing to the
   respiratory distress. The most likely etiologies are prior pneumonia
   and over-sedation. The high dose of midazolam and fentanyl are
   certainly not helping to extubation.
   -          Continue Vancomycin (day 7)
   -          Continue Caspofungin (day 7)

   -          Talk with psychiatry about re-starting Ritalin, which may
   help to awake him and stimulate breathing
   -          Change target SpO2 to 90-95% instead of the 98-100%
   -          Deacrease fentanyl and midazolan
   -          Start Oxycodone for pain control
   -          Change FiO2 to 35% today
   # Pneumonia: Patient  is afebrile and with lower FiO2 requirements.
   Physical exam improved compared to prior nots. Currently on day 7 of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) post allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been admitted to the ICU for the past two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he remains in respiratory distress. Metabolic alkalosis is improving, and he is awake and cooperative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be multifactorial, including pneumonia, restrictive pneumopathy due to tight skin (GVHD), and previous lung disease. Over-sedation and metabolic alkalosis may also contribute to the respiratory distress. Prior pneumonia and over-sedation are the most likely etiologies. The high dose of midazolam and fentanyl are not helping with extubation.

Plan:
- Continue Vancomycin (day 7)
- Check I/O, target net balance -500cc
- Administer Atrovent nebs PRN
- Check spontaneous breathing test today; may be able to extubate
- Replete K; target 4.5

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Patient with stable O2 and pressure requirements, but patient still
   with very small tidal volumes. He is very awake and cooperating.
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  We will need to re-assess for
   tracheostomy and long-term goals.
   -Check I/O; target balance close to cero
   -Atrovent nebs PRN
   -F/u bicarb
   # Pneumonia: Patient doing better from the respiratory point of view.
   CXR improved.
   -          Vancomycin (day 3); Day 1 is the firtst one with therapeutic
   level.
   -          Decrease FiO2
   # Pain control: Patient currently on Fentanyl, being wean out. Was
   started on morphine yesterday.
   -          Increase methadone to 10mg today.
   # Tachycardia: Patient anemic, with resolving pneumonia and electrolyte
   imbalance as possible etiologies of her tachycardia. Patient has been
   in the 90
s most of the time.
   - Consider titrating up Lopressor  today if BP tolerates
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient much more awake compare to prior
   notes, however still on fentanyl and midazolam.
   - Decrease fentanyl
   - Decrease midazolam
   - Increase methadone for pain control
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - Tacrolimus dose was decreased in half, becapuse patient with
   posaconasol
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given intubation
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - Ask psychiatry if ok to restart ritalyn
   .
   # FEN: TF were stopped in the setting of anticipation of possible
   extubation today. Yesterday they were re-started after the failed
   attempt, but patient became nauseous.
   -          Re-start tube feeds slower than yesterday
   -          Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Access: 2 lumen PICC
 TPA for clogged lumen.  PIV very difficult to
   get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement if needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Lovenox 60mg sc BID, restart bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL .  Family okay with trial of intubation, but [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
   long-term intubation.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU until extubated

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005. He has been admitted to the ICU for the past two months with hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute lung syndrome (ALS) aspiration pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress, metabolic alkalosis, pneumonia, tachycardia, mental status changes, GVHD, and major depressive disorder.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to pneumonia and restrictive pneumomathy caused by tight skin (GVHD). This could lead to further hypoxia and potential respiratory failure.

2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's pneumonia seems to be improving, there is still a risk of complications such as worsening infection, sepsis, or development of antibiotic resistance.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is improving, but it needs to be closely monitored. If not managed properly, it can lead to complications like cardiac arrhythmias or seizures.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to anemia, resolving pneumonia, and electrolyte imbalance. Close monitoring is required, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as cardiovascular"

   Assessment and Plan
   1)       Acute Respiratory Failure: Etiology likely combination of
   aspiration pneumonia in the background of restrictive lung disease from
   GVHD
   Plan: Complete course of vancomycin for HAP
             Wean off mechanical ventilation as tolerated.  At this point,
   limited significantly by restrictive physiology of the chest wall
   2)       Tachycardia: unclear etiology but improved slightly.  Already
   on lovenox full dose for DVT so no concern for PE.
   3)        GVHD: check tacro levels
   4)       Depression: Psych recs
   5)       FEN: re-start at low rate and titrate upwards
   6)       Full dose lovenox for upper extremity DVT

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with lymphoma who underwent a bone marrow transplant and is now experiencing acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia and restrictive lung disease caused by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. He has been receiving various antibiotics and other medications, including enoxaparin for an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, and his respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.35. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The assessment and plan include treating acute respiratory failure, addressing tachycardia, managing GVHD, treating depression, restarting fentanyl infusion, and initiating full-dose lovenox for the DVT. The patient is in the ICU, and his code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Patient with stable O2 and pressure requirements, but patient still
   with very small tidal volumes. He is very awake and cooperating.
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  We will need to re-assess for
   tracheostomy and long-term goals.
   -Check I/O; target balance close to cero
   -Atrovent nebs PRN
   -F/u bicarb
   # Pneumonia: Patient doing better from the respiratory point of view.
   CXR improved.
   -          Vancomycin (day 3); Day 1 is the firtst one with therapeutic
   level.
   -          Decrease FiO2
   # Pain control: Patient currently on Fentanyl, being wean out. Was
   started on morphine yesterday.
   -          Increase methadone to 10mg today.
   # Tachycardia: Patient anemic, with resolving pneumonia and electrolyte
   imbalance as possible etiologies of her tachycardia. Patient has been
   in the 90
s most of the time.
   - Consider titrating up Lopressor  today if BP tolerates
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient much more awake compare to prior
   notes, however still on fentanyl and midazolam.
   - Decrease fentanyl
   - Decrease midazolam
   - Increase methadone for pain control
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - Tacrolimus dose was decreased in half, becapuse patient with
   posaconasol
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given intubation
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - Ask psychiatry if ok to restart ritalyn
   .
   # FEN: TF were stopped in the setting of anticipation of possible
   extubation today. Yesterday they were re-started after the failed
   attempt, but patient became nauseous.
   -          Re-start tube feeds slower than yesterday
   -          Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Access: 2 lumen PICC
 TPA for clogged lumen.  PIV very difficult to
   get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005. He has been inpatient for the past two months and is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute respiratory lung injury (RLL) infiltrate. The patient's respiratory distress is likely multifactorial, including pneumonia and restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD). He has stable oxygen and pressure requirements but still has very small tidal volumes. The patient's metabolic alkalosis is improving. 

The patient is also diagnosed with pneumonia, which is showing improvement on the chest X-ray. He is currently on vancomycin (day 3), and his FiO2 is being decreased. 

Additionally, the patient has pain control issues and is currently on fentanyl. He is being weaned off morphine. Methadone has been increased to 10 mg today. 

Tachycardia is another issue, and possible etiologies include anemia, resolving pneumonia, and electrolyte imbalance. 

The patient's mental status changes are likely due to fentanyl and midazolam. Fentanyl and midazolam are being decreased, while methadone is being increased for pain control. 

GVHD is ongoing, and the patient is on a regimen of Gleevec, Tacrolimus, Cellcept, and IV methylprednisolone.

   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Patient with stable O2 and pressure requirements, but patient still
   with very small tidal volumes. He is very awake and cooperating.
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  We will need to re-assess for
   tracheostomy and long-term goals.
   -Check I/O; target balance close to cero
   -Atrovent nebs PRN
   -F/u bicarb
   # Pneumonia: Patient doing better from the respiratory point of view.
   CXR improved.
   -          Vancomycin (day 4); Day 1 is the firtst one with therapeutic
   level.
   # Pain control: Patient currently on Fentanyl, being wean out. Was
   started on morphine yesterday.
   -          Continue current doses; wean of fentanyl if possible.
   # Tachycardia: Patient anemic, with resolving pneumonia and electrolyte
   imbalance as possible etiologies of her tachycardia. Patient has been
   in the 90
s most of the time.
   - Consider titrating up Lopressor  today if BP tolerates
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient much more awake compare to prior
   notes, however still on fentanyl and midazolam.
   - Decrease fentanyl
   - Decrease midazolam
   - Increase methadone for pain control
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - Tacrolimus traught was low, however re-checking tomorrow and will
   re-assess per pharmacy recs
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u BMT recs

   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given intubation
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - Ask psychiatry if ok to restart ritalyn
   .
   # FEN: TF were stopped in the setting of anticipation of possible
   extubation today. Yesterday they were re-started after the failed
   attempt, but patient became nauseous.
   -          Re-start tube feeds slower than yesterday
   -          Replete lytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005. He has been an inpatient for the last two months due to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory distress and acute respiratory lung injury (ARL). His oxygen requirements are stable, but he still requires small tidal volumes. Metabolic alkalosis is improving. There are plans to reassess the need for a tracheostomy and long-term goals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including pneumonia and restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD). This can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and may require invasive interventions such as mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.

2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, the presence of pneumonia increases the risk of complications such as sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and prolonged hospital stay.

3. GVHD: The patient's history of severe GVHD puts him at risk for ongoing skin changes, organ dysfunction, and infection. Monitoring and management of GVHD are essential to prevent further complications.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be due to factors such as anemia, resolving pneumonia, and electrolyte imbalance. Close monitoring of the"

   34 y/o M with PMHx of large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogenic stem cell
   transplant in 05 c/b severe GVHD who has been inpatient for last 2mths
   here with hypercarbic respiratory distress and ALS [**12-30**] aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Patient with stable O2 and pressure requirements, but patient still
   with very small tidal volumes. He is very awake and cooperating.
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  We will need to re-assess for
   tracheostomy and long-term goals.
   -Check I/O; target balance close to cero
   -Atrovent nebs PRN
   -F/u bicarb
   # Pneumonia: Patient doing better from the respiratory point of view.
   CXR improved.
   -          Vancomycin (day 3); Day 1 is the firtst one with therapeutic
   level.
   -          Decrease FiO2
   # Pain control: Patient currently on Fentanyl, being wean out. Was
   started on morphine yesterday.
   -          Increase methadone to 10mg today.
   # Tachycardia: Patient anemic, with resolving pneumonia and electrolyte
   imbalance as possible etiologies of her tachycardia. Patient has been
   in the 90
s most of the time.
   - Consider titrating up Lopressor  today if BP tolerates
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient much more awake compare to prior
   notes, however still on fentanyl and midazolam.
   - Decrease fentanyl
   - Decrease midazolam
   - Increase methadone for pain control
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**].
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - Tacrolimus dose was decreased in half, becapuse patient with
   posaconasol
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - holding long acting Benzos given intubation
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - Ask psychiatry if ok to restart ritalyn
   .
   # FEN: TF were stopped in the setting of anticipation of possible
   extubation today. Yesterday they were re-started after the failed
   attempt, but patient became nauseous.
   -          Re-start tube feeds slower than yesterday
   -          Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Access: 2 lumen PICC
 TPA for clogged lumen.  PIV very difficult to
   get in this patient.
   -IR for central line placement if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2005 and is currently experiencing severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has been admitted to the hospital for the past two months and is currently in the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be multifactorial, including restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD), pneumonia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which could lead to worsening lung infection and respiratory distress if not adequately treated.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may continue to improve with appropriate management, but close monitoring is required.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be due to anemia, resolving pneumonia, and electrolyte imbalance. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rate and consider titrating Lopressor if the blood pressure allows.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient is more awake compared to previous notes, but still on fentanyl and midazolam. Decreasing the doses of these medications may be necessary to assess for any mental status changes.
6. GVHD: The patient is at risk for further complications related to GVHD, such as liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. They have been admitted with acute respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range, heart rate slightly elevated, blood pressure within acceptable limits, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.

Overnight, the patient's fentanyl infusion was decreased, and methadone was titrated up for pain control. Tube feeds were continued. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including meropenem, caspofungin, and vancomycin. The patient also received infusions of midazolam (versed), fentanyl, and enoxaparin (lovenox).

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit levels, and normal platelet levels. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Other lab results, including kidney function tests and liver enzymes, are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, as indicated by their ongoing need for mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of extubation being considered.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been on a complete 8-day course of vancomycin. However, the resolution of pneumonia should be closely monitored to prevent any complications such as sepsis or"

","The patient is an intubated ICU admitted patient with an acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, pain, GVDH (likely graft versus host disease), FEN (likely feeding intolerance), and DVT (deep vein thrombosis). The patient is currently on bipap and being evaluated for possible extubation. The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin for pneumonia. Pain control is being managed by weaning fentanyl and increasing methadone. Tacrolimus levels are low for GVDH. Reglan is being used to help with motility for FEN. The patient has a PICC line and is on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is pending."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 99/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, versed, methadone, caspofungin, meropenem, vancomycin, midazolam, and enoxaparin. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, ranging from 139-187 mg/dL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.4-7.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 498-515 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range, and kidney function appears to be normal based on the creatinine levels. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, pain, GVDH (likely graft-versus-host disease), FEN (likely familial dysautonomia), DVT (deep vein thrombosis), and other conditions. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is receiving enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a concern for blood clots. If a clot forms and dislodges, it could lead to a PE, which can be life-threatening.
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVDH): The patient's medical history suggests a possible stem cell or bone marrow transplant. GVDH is a potential complication in these patients, where the donated cells attack the recipient's body.
4. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, suggesting an active infection. The elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may indicate a systemic infection.
5. Kidney injury: The elevated creatinine level indicates a potential impairment in kidney function.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial admission was due to acute respiratory failure, and there is a risk of continued respiratory compromise.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional details and assessments may be required for a comprehensive evaluation."

   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - f/u any new psych recs
   .
   # FEN: Patient has had increased nausea with TF. Stopped for the time
   being, added zofran, zydis. Will retry once more today and reassess. If
   pt not able to tolerate may need to start TPN.
   -          Re-start tube feeds slower than yesterday

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Vital signs show a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has received multiple doses of acyclovir and vancomycin. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,977 mL with a total output of 2,150 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -173 mL. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with a range of 86-175 mg/dL. Lab results indicate elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and increased creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation should be done regularly.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an adult admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. They have a history of pneumonia and are currently being treated with vancomycin. The patient also has pain control issues and is being considered for an increase in methadone. Additionally, the patient is diagnosed with depression. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/77 mmHg to 142/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,977 mL and output of 2,150 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -173 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has a history of depression and pain control issues. The plan includes continuing treatment for pneumonia, discontinuing vancomycin, increasing methadone for pain management, and addressing depression. The patient's ICU care involves nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  Yesterday discussed possibility of
   trach, however today he is doing much better on  minimal pressure
   support.
   -reassess RISBI, consider extubation today/tomorrow
   -Atrovent nebs PRN
   -F/u bicarb levels
   -? Trach in future for long term care goals
   # Pneumonia: Patient doing better from the respiratory point of view.
   CXR improved. Would consider d/c vancomycin
   -          Vancomycin (day 5); Day 1 is the firtst one with therapeutic
   level. [**8-6**] last day.
   -          f/u vanco levels this afternoon to ensure therapeutic level
   -          f/u CXR
   # Pain control: Successfully weaned off fentanyl. continue morphine and
   methadone as written.
   -          Continue current regimen
   # Tachycardia: Patient anemic, with resolving pneumonia and electrolyte
   imbalance as possible etiologies of his tachycardia.
   - continue lopressor
   - telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   # Mental Status changes: Patient much more awake compare to prior. Off
   sedation.
   - continue to monitor
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**]. Tac 5.2 today,
   will defer need to increase based on BMT recs.
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry is following.
   - Continue remeron per psych recs
   - f/u any new psych recs
   .
   # FEN: Patient has had increased nausea with TF. Stopped for the time
   being, added zofran, zydis. Will retry once more today and reassess. If
   pt not able to tolerate may need to start TPN.
   -          Re-start tube feeds slower than yesterday
   -          Replete lytes PRN
   -          Consider TPN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple ongoing medical issues. Some of the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia with restrictive pneumomathy caused by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's respiratory support has been adjusted, and they are currently on minimal pressure support. The plan is to reassess the respiratory rate and consider extubation today or tomorrow.

2. Pneumonia: The patient appears to be improving from a respiratory standpoint, with an improved chest X-ray. There is a possibility of discontinuing vancomycin, as it is day 5 and the first day with therapeutic levels. Further follow-up with vancomycin levels and chest X-ray is recommended.

3. Pain control: The patient has successfully been weaned off fentanyl and is now on morphine and methadone for pain management. The current regimen should be continued.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be caused by anemia, resolving pneumonia, and electrolyte imbalance. The plan is to continue lopressor, monitor with telemetry, and continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID.

5. Mental status changes: The patient is more awake and alert compared to before, and sedation has been discontinued. Monitoring of mental status changes is advised.

6. GVHD: The patient's GV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-inch tall male who is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing respiratory distress, which is most likely due to pneumonia with restrictive pneumomathy caused by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Metabolic alkalosis is also present and improving. The patient is also dealing with pain control issues, tachycardia, mental status changes, GVHD, major depressive disorder, and increased nausea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if pneumonia is not effectively treated or if there is further deterioration in pulmonary function. The restrictive pneumomathy caused by GVHD can also contribute to ongoing respiratory problems.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: Although the patient's metabolic alkalosis is improving, it can still lead to complications if not properly managed. This could include electrolyte imbalances and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may persist or worsen if the underlying causes, such as anemia, resolving pneumonia, or electrolyte imbalances, are not addressed.
4. GVHD: GVHD is a serious complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. It can cause damage to various organs, including the lungs, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Close monitoring and management of GVHD are essential to prevent further organ damage.
5. Major Depressive Disorder: Untreated major depressive disorder can have a significant impact on the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with respiratory distress and metabolic syndrome changes. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of pneumonia, GVHD, pain control issues, tachycardia, mental status changes, major depressive disorder, and FEN (gastrointestinal symptoms). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 108/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including vancomycin for pneumonia, furosemide for fluid management, enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, and various other medications for pain control, GVHD, and mental health. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to pneumonia and restrictive pneumomathy caused by tight skin (GVHD). There is a risk of further deterioration in pulmonary function.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is improving but may require close monitoring and management with diuretics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and multiple system changes. The patient is unable to tolerate oral or tube feeding, and a nutrition consult has been ordered for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's medications include vancomycin, enoxaparin, furosemide, and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm and blood pressure of 108/55 mmHg. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of PRVC/AC, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 104. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 71 mmHg, PaO2 of 240 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 51000 cells/microliter, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 30.2%. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium (K+) level of 3.8 mEq/L. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on [**2170-8-2**] at 10:04 PM and [**2170-8-4**] at 08:08 PM. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcer bleeding, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and delirium. These complications should be closely monitored and managed appropriately to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   24 Hour Events:
   On Saturday night patient's ventilator onf [**9-2**], vent settings changed
   yesterday to [**4-2**] all during the day and patient tolerated well.
   Apparently overnight patient became apneic on these settings, switched
   back to AC. Discussion with BMT was had yesterday regarding patient's
   Gleevac has pt has been off yesterday secondary to nausea/vomiting.
   Today plan to re-start. Ordered by BMT for 200 mg today. This morning
   on T-tube only. Breathing comfortable. Patient stating that he does not
   want to be re-intubated if fails trail of extubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  Would benefit from lasix diuresis,
   decrease in fluid therapy which will likely improve pulmonary function.
   Will need to discuss whether tracheostomy is an option for him at this
   point.
   -initally did okay on [**4-2**] yesterday now on T-tube, will extubate this
   AM
   - check ABG after extubation
   - patient does not want to be reintubated
   -Atrovent nebs PRN
   -readdress trach issue
    # Pneumonia: Vancomycin dosed yesterday morning for level of 13.
   Continue per ID recs.

The patient is a 69-year-old male with worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress, mental status change, and new right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate. The patient's ventilator settings were changed yesterday, and he became apneic overnight. He is currently on assisted control (AC) mode. The patient's Gleevac has been temporarily discontinued due to nausea/vomiting but will be restarted at a dose of 200 mg today. The patient prefers not to be reintubated if extubation fails. 

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on [**2170-8-6**] at 05:21 AM. He is receiving various infusions including Enoxaparin, Furosemide, Midazolam, and Fentanyl. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/64 mmHg to 153/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab results are within normal limits. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and appropriate antibiotics have been administered. Cultures have been obtained, showing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on CPAP mode with an FiO2 of 50%. He is unable to provide a full history due to being intubated. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/81 to 153/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on several medications including furosemide, midazolam, fentanyl, enoxaparin, and TPN. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for nutritional support being NPO. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on multiple occasions, and his WBC count has shown fluctuations. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure likely secondary to pneumonia and restrictive physiology, tachycardia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), graft versus host disease (GVHD), and feeding intolerance. The plan includes extubation, continuing lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, holding GVHD treatment, and starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to intolerance to tube feeding. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old with respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia on top of restrictive physiology. The patient is intubated and currently on CPAP mode with an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/81 to 153/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is also being treated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), graft versus host disease (GVHD), and febrile non-hemolytic neutropenia (FNH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure may require extended periods of mechanical ventilation, which can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other complications.
2. Barotrauma: The high plateau pressure (28 cmH2O) suggests a risk of barotrauma, which can lead to lung injury and further respiratory complications.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The use of high tidal volumes (Vt set at 500 mL) may contribute to VILI, leading to worsening lung function and potential infection.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged int"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  Patient was succesfully extubated
   yesterday. Pt got 0.5mg of IV Lorazepam and his CO2 increased. Now
   requiring BIPAP again. Goal of care must be clarified. If patient wants
   to be CMO, then ativan can be given explaining to him the risk and
   benefits. Otherwise, other medications for pain control and anxiety can
   be tried. Yesterday patient stated that he did not want to be intubated
   again.
   - continue BIPAP for now
   - ABGs later today
   - If patient not improving give flumazenil 0.2mg IV
   -Atrovent nebs PRN
   -Clarify if intubation or CMO when patient able to make the decission.
    # Pneumonia: Vancomycin dosed yesterday morning for level of 13.
   Continue per ID recs.
   -   vancomycin stopped yesterday
   -   CXR in 2 weeks to make sure pt cleared
   - blood cultures no growth to date
   - pleural fluid with + polys but no microorganisms identified
   # Pain control: Successfully weaned off fentanyl. Patient on standing
   tylenol, oxycodone PRN  and IV morphine PRN. Patient received ativan
   for pain control earlier today having the same episode that brought him
   to the ICU.
   -  Continue standing tylenol
   -  [**Month (only) 60**] try lidocaine patch in the chest
   -  Once goals defined may try oxycontin plus oxycodone PRN
   -  Can do morphine PRN as well
   - Pain and paliative care consults
    # Tachycardia: Pt has been tachycardic all the time during the
   hospital stay. Most likely multifactorial in the setting of anemia,
   GVHD.
   - continue lopressor, with continued tachycardia will titrate up
   b-blocker dose to 25 mg PO BID with holding parameters for HR < 60, BP
   < 100
   - cont telemetry
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID for history of upper extremity DVT
   - f/u TSH
   #. GVHD: Continue regimen per BMT. Last IVIG on [**2170-7-27**]. Last Tac dose
   of 5.2.
   - continue Gleevec, Tacrolimus, cellcept and IV methlprednisolone
   - continue atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - recheck tac level in [**12-31**] days
   - Check tac result from today later today .
   #Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry following.
   - Continue remeron
   - f/u any new psych recs
   # FEN: F/u nutrition recs.
   -  Change PO meds to IV if possible, otherwise attempt to space out PO
   meds to minimize nausea
   -  Replete lytes PRN
   - TPN as per nutrition
   # Access: 2 lumen PICC, peripheral IV
   .# PPx: PPI, Lovenox 60mg sc BID, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of shortness of breath and anxiety. He was previously on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated yesterday. The patient is now on a BiPAP machine for respiratory support. He has a history of GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease) and pneumonia. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 111 bpm and blood pressure of 116/68 mmHg. The patient is tachycardic, likely due to anemia and GVHD. He is receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain control medication, and antianxiety medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be multifactorial, involving pneumonia, restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD), and metabolic alkalosis. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday but required reintubation due to increased CO2 levels after receiving IV Lorazepam. The goal of care must be clarified, and the patient's desire for comfort measures only (CMO) should be considered.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, for which vancomycin was started yesterday with a target level of 13. It is important to continue per ID (Infectious Disease) recommendations, including stopping vancomycin since blood cultures have shown no growth to date. A chest X-ray in two weeks should be done to ensure clearance of the infection.

3. Pain Control: The patient's pain is being managed with standing Tylenol, oxycodone PRN, and IV morphine PRN. However, the patient received ativan for pain control earlier today, which caused the same episode that led to his ICU admission. Pain and palliative care consults should be continued.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, caused by anemia and GVHD. Lopressor should be continued, and the dose should be titrated up to 25 mg PO BID with holding parameters for HR < 60, BP < 100. Telemetry should also be continued.

5. GVHD: The patient's GVHD should be managed according to the BMT (Bone Marrow Transplant) regimen. Tacrolimus, cellcept, and IV methylprednisolone should be continued. Atovaquone and acyclovir prophylaxis should also be continued. Tacrolimus levels should be rechecked in 12 days.

6. Major Depressive Disorder: Psychiatry follow-up is recommended for the patient's major depressive disorder. Remeron should be continued, and any new psychiatric recommendations should be followed.

7. FEN (Feeding): Nutrition recommendations should be followed, including changing PO (oral) medications to IV if possible or spacing out PO medications to minimize nausea. Lytes should be replete PRN, and TPN (total parenteral nutrition) should be managed per nutrition recommendations.

8. Access: The patient has a 2 lumen PICC (peripheral inserted central catheter) line and a peripheral IV line.

9. PPx (Preventive Prophylaxis): PPI (proton pump inhibitor), Lovenox 60mg sc BID (low molecular weight heparin), and bowel regimen should be continued.

10. Code: The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate).

11. Disposition: Consider transfer after respiratory distress is resolved or if the patient is CMO."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of shortness of breath and anxiety. He was previously on invasive ventilation but was extubated yesterday and now on a shelf mask with 15 L of oxygen. The patient is experiencing pain in his chest, which is believed to be a mix of anxiety, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and restrictive component in his chest. He has been given IV morphine and IV fentanyl for pain management and started on standing tylenol and oxycodone as needed. Methadone was stopped. The patient also has anxiety related to his disease and terminal illness, for which he is being followed by psychiatry on the floors and receiving 0.5 mg of ativan IV.

Medical Complications:
1. GVHD: The patient's pain and stiff skin changes are likely due to GVHD, which is a common complication in stem cell transplant recipients. GVHD occurs when the donated stem cells view the recipient's body as foreign and attack it.

2. Respiratory Compromise: The patient's previous need for invasive ventilation indicates respiratory compromise. His current symptoms of shortness of breath and pain in the chest suggest ongoing respiratory issues. The use of a shelf mask with 15 L of oxygen indicates the need for significant respiratory support.

3. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is exacerbated by his terminal illness and may contribute to his increased heart rate and respiratory rate. It is being managed with medication"

   # Respiratory Distress:  Most likely multifactorial in the setting of
   pneumonia with a restrictive pneumomathy due to tight skin (GVHD).
   Metabolic alkalosis improving.  Would benefit from lasix diuresis,
   decrease in fluid therapy which will likely improve pulmonary function.
   Will need to discuss whether tracheostomy is an option for him at this
   point.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath and anxiety. The patient was previously intubated but has now been extubated and placed on a T-tube. They are experiencing pain in their chest, which may be due to a combination of anxiety, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and restrictive lung disease. The patient is receiving IV morphine and fentanyl for pain management.

The patient has a history of pneumonia, for which they were given vancomycin. The antibiotic course will be completed today, and then the patient will be discharged from vancomycin.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal kidney function and electrolyte levels. The patient's respiratory culture indicates growth of Staphylococcus aureus, which is sensitive to gentamicin, rifampin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia and restrictive lung disease caused by GVHD. Metabolic alkalosis is also present, which may improve with the use of lasix diuresis and a decrease in fluid therapy. Tracheostomy is being considered as an option for the patient.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include pain control, tachycardia, GVHD, major depressive disorder, increased nausea, access for medication administration, prophylactic measures, and code status."

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Distress:
   - patient appears in severe respiratory distress at this time.  Per
   wishes, he does not want to be re-intubated and this was stated in the
   presence of wife and family and is reasonable choice given the advanced
   progression of his disease.
   Plan:
   - will check ABG
   - will attempt bipap
   2) Pneumonia
   3) GVHD
   Addendum: Patient had severe hypercarbia pCO2 = 200 and pH 6.9.  He
   failed to respond to bipap and this is apparently irreversible given
   that patient wishes were not to be re-intubated.  His wife was
   [**Name (NI) 420**] and was at bedside.  Patient died.

   Disposition : ICU
   Total time spent: 35 (patient was critically ill)
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing severe respiratory distress and has a history of advanced disease progression. The patient's wishes not to be re-intubated were respected, and the decision was made to attempt bipap ventilation. However, the patient did not respond to bipap and subsequently passed away.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing severe respiratory distress, which can lead to respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of further complications.

3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): GVHD is mentioned as one of the assessments and plans, indicating that the patient may be undergoing a bone marrow transplant or stem cell therapy. GVHD is a serious complication that occurs when donor immune cells attack the recipient's body.

4. Hypercarbia: The patient had severe hypercarbia (elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), which can be a sign of respiratory failure or inadequate ventilation.

5. Metabolic acidosis: The low pH value indicates metabolic acidosis, which can be associated with respiratory failure and inadequate oxygenation.

6. Infection: The presence of pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which can complicate the patient's condition.

7. Organ dysfunction: The elevated lactate level and other abnormal laboratory values"
