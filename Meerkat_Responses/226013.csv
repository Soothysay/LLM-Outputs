   Overnight, became hypotensive with low urine outputs, BP responded to
   multiple boluses of IVF.  Further improvement in BP occurred with
   decrease in PEEP from 10 to 5 and discontinuation of epidural.  The
   patient did not require re-starting pressors.
   This morning improved blood pressures to SBP of 110s, oxygenating in
   low 90s
   UOP continues to be ~25cc/hr.
   This morning, RSBI is 50, pt. was noted to have copious white
   secretions, and SBT stopped short.
   ABG this AM: 7.41/47/80/31/3
   The patient continues to maintain good sats on PS 5/5/50%.  She is
   arousable, blinks and nods appropriately in response to commands,
   complains of significant pain in abdomen at the site of surgical
   incision.
   The patient was manitained on Fentanyl boluses O/N, but this AM

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with
   large ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy.
   # Respiratory status: The patient is currently intubated on mechanical
   ventilation.  Mental status appropriate for extubation.  RSBI favorable
   for extubation. The barriers to extubation at this point are pain
   control and copious secretions, which may be suggestive of an acute
   infectious process, although there are no fevers or elevated WBC
   counts, and CXR does not show clear evidence of PNA.
   - Repeat CXR this AM
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - wean off profopol
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - VAP bundle
   - Plan for extubation after a few hours of observation if pain and
   secretions are under control.
   .
   # Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   # Pain control:  The patient re-started on epidural this AM.
   - appreciate continued pain service recs
   - continue epidural anesthesia
   - senna/colace
   - Adjust doses to maintain adequate pain control
   # Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -Continue Ancef 2mg q6hrs while JP tubes are in place
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline saturations
   of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a year ago but
   appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge documentation
   describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77
   while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the question that this
   may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing  e.g. secondary to
   moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes on left side in
   particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left
   hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decrease
   ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - repeat CXR
   - if hypoxia persists will consider CTA
   - CPAP at night after extubation
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   .
   # Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   # HTN:  Hold for now given hypotension overnight.
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   - will likely restart Procardia and HCTZ if pt. Becomes hypertensive
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma who underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 107/51 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is arousable and responds appropriately to voice commands. Physical examination reveals diffuse coarse expiratory wheezing and rhonchi bilaterally, with no signs of jugular venous distention or carotid bruits. 

The patient's pain control remains a concern due to copious secretions, which may suggest an acute infectious process. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes. There are no clear signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. 

The patient's low urine output is improving with IV fluid administration, but it still remains low. The bladder scan and Foley flush did not reveal any evidence of obstruction. 

The patient has a history of hypoxemia, with pre-operative evaluations showing baseline saturations of 85-89%. The current PaO2 of 77 on 50% FiO2 indicates acute hypoxemia, which could be due to decreased ventilation of the left lung or hidden pneumonia. 

Other issues include asthma, hypertension, and diabetes"

   Large intrapelvic mass measuring 21.8 x 17.2 x 21.7 cm, with cystic and
   solid components. Origin likely from the right ovary, and this may
   represent a cystic neoplasm such as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.
   Alternatively, this mass may arise from the uterine fundus, in which
   case this may represent a degenerating fibroid, but a leiomyosarcoma is
   not excluded. Recommend pelvic
   ultrasound to attempt further characterization. No intrapelvic fluid or
   evidence of peritoneal deposits or intra-abdominal lesions.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with
   large ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy.
   # Ovarian Mass:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc reccs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   .
   # Low UOP: likely [**2-4**] third spacing, now improving with additional IVF.
   BP WNL. Has received 7L NS.
   - switch to LR maintenance and bolus PRN low UOP
   .
   # Pain control:
   - appreciate pain service reccs
   - epidural anesthesia
   - senna/colace
   - will obtain am PTT/PT given heparin sc and epidural catheter
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation: Given extensive surgery, will maintain
   mechanical ventilation until am per anesthesia and surgery. Patient is
   still also weaning off of paralytics.
   - profopol
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - VAP bundle
   - am SBT
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline saturations
   of 89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a year ago but
   appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge documentation
   describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77
   while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the question that this
   may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing  e.g. secondary to
   moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes on left side in
   particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left
   hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decrease
   ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - retratract ET tube
   - repeat CXR
   - if hypoxia persists will consider CTA
   - mechanical ventilation tonight
   - CPAP at night after extubation
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat echo as oupt
   .
   # Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   # HTN:
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   - will likely restart Procardia in am, continute to hold HCTZ
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - hold glyburide for NPO
   - hold metformin as pt may need imaging
   - SSI
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, obesity, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and hypertension. She presented with a pelvic mass and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and panniculectomy. The surgery was uneventful, with minimal blood loss. However, the patient experienced reduced urine output requiring intravenous fluids (IVF). She was briefly hypotensive and hypertensive in the operating room, requiring transient phenylephrine. Upon arrival in the ICU, she was intubated, still paralyzed with epidural anesthesia.

The patient has a large pelvic mass measuring 21.8 x 17.2 x 21.7 cm, with cystic and solid components. The origin of the mass is likely from the right ovary, possibly representing a cystic neoplasm such as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Alternatively, it may arise from the uterine fundus, which could be a degenerating fibroid or leiomyosarcoma. Further characterization is recommended through pelvic ultrasound.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 96.4°F, pulse rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/67 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 95% on 50% FiO2, and respiratory"

   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.  Remained intubated primarly for airway mangement following
   anesthesia/paralytics.  Copious secretions, and radiographic evidence
   for LLL density (possible attalectasis vs. evolving infiltrate).  Hope
   to work towards extubation trial.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  Monitor, with low threhold for antimicrobials.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Continue iv fluid repletion
   for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy for a large right adnexal mass. She remains intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is attributed to underlying asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and hypoxemia. The patient also has oliguria, hypotension, and hypomagnesemia. Her pain management regimen is being optimized, and pathology results for the adenexal mass are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent, and she requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further complications such as pneumonia due to the presence of copious secretions and a pulmonary infiltrate in the left lower lobe (LLL). Close monitoring and consideration of a computed tomography angiography (CTA) if hypoxemic are necessary.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is attributed to the LLL infiltrate and background conditions such as sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. It is important to maintain SaO2 >90% and pO2 >60 mmHg. A repeat cardiac echo may be considered to assess the right side.

3. Oliguria: The patient has low urine output, which needs to be managed by continuing intravenous fluid repletion and aiming for a goal of 20 cc/hr. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload is essential"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.  Remained intubated primarly for airway mangement following
   anesthesia/paralytics.  Copious secretions, and radiographic evidence
   for LLL density (possible attalectasis vs. evolving infiltrate).  Hope
   to work towards extubation trial this AM.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  Monitor, with low threhold for antimicrobials.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Continue iv fluid repletion
   for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy for a large right adnexal mass. The patient remains intubated post-operation and is experiencing respiratory failure. She has a history of asthma and pulmonary hypertension, and radiographic evidence suggests a lower lobe lung infiltrate, possibly atelectasis or evolving pneumonia. The patient also has hypoxemia, likely due to sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. She was stable overnight on mechanical ventilation, with plans to attempt extubation this morning. 

The patient's oliguria (low urine output) is attributed to surgery-related factors and will continue to receive intravenous fluid repletion. Hypotension was initially attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects but has now improved. Fluid repletion will be continued to address hypovolemia, likely due to intra-abdominal third spacing from surgery. 

The patient has hypomagnesemia, which will be repleted intravenously. Pain management for the incisional pain persists and will be optimized. 

Other findings include elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure - Persistent, primarily due to airway management after anesthesia/paralytics. Copious secretions and radiographic evidence of LLL density (possible atelectasis vs"

   24 Hour Events:
   Remains intubated, mechanically ventilated.
   RSBI= 50 --> placed on SBT with IPS=5 and PEEP= 8.  SBT curtailed due
   to significant coughing.
   Copiou secretions, although clear.
   Experienced hypotension overnight.
   Exhibited low urine output.
   Continued to receive iv fluiids with some response.  Did not require
   vasopressor.
   BP improved with discontinuation of epidural anesthesia --> receiving
   iv bolus for pain management.  Epidural catheter resumed this AM.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy for a large right adnexal mass. The patient remains intubated post-operation due to respiratory failure, which is persistent and attributed to underlying asthma and pulmonary hypertension. The patient also has known moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension but has documented normal saturation from a previous inpatient admission last month.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm (64-84)
- Blood pressure: 135/62 mmHg (83-153/43-76)
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (10-30)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on mechanical ventilation

The patient has a history of allergies to ace inhibitors and cough. The last dose of antibiotics was cefazolin at 10:07 PM on 11/6. The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion at 30 mcg/kg/min, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and lansoprazole (Prevacid).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following:
- Cardiovascular: No chest pain, palpitations, edema, tachycardia, or orthopnea.
- Nutritional Support: NPO, not receiving tube feeds or parenteral nutrition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with
   large ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy.
   # Respiratory status: The patient is extubated. The barriers to
   extubation at this point are pain control and copious secretions, which
   may be suggestive of an acute infectious process, although there are no
   fevers or elevated WBC counts, and CXR does not show clear evidence of
   PNA.
   - Repeat CXR this AM
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - wean off profopol
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - VAP bundle
   - Plan for extubation after a few hours of observation if pain and
   secretions are under control.
   .
   # Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   # Pain control:  The patient re-started on epidural this AM.
   - appreciate continued pain service recs
   - continue epidural anesthesia
   - senna/colace
   - Adjust doses to maintain adequate pain control
   # Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -Continue Ancef 2mg q6hrs while JP tubes are in place
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline saturations
   of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a year ago but
   appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge documentation
   describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77
   while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the question that this
   may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing  e.g. secondary to
   moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes on left side in
   particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left
   hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decrease
   ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - repeat CXR
   - if hypoxia persists will consider CTA
   - CPAP at night after extubation
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   .
   # Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   # HTN:  Hold for now given hypotension overnight.
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   - will likely restart Procardia and HCTZ if pt. Becomes hypertensive
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #) FEN: NPO for now
   .
   #) Access: TLC, a-line
   .
   #) Code Status: presumed Full
   .
   #) Dispo: pending further work-up and treatment

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. She underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy and is currently in the ICU. 

The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was extubated in the morning. She developed a fever of 101.7°F at 11 p.m. and had a spike in temperature. The fever is concerning for an acute infectious process, although there are no clear signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and she is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a face tent. Her oxygen saturation is 91%, and her respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute.

The patient has low urine output, which is improving with intravenous fluid administration. There is no evidence of obstruction based on a bladder scan and Foley flush. Pain control is a concern, and the patient has been restarted on epidural anesthesia. 

There are concerns about the patient's hypoxemia, as her pre-operative evaluation revealed baseline saturations of 85-89%. This could be due to acute or long-standing causes such as moderate pulmonary hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea. Further evaluation, including a repeat chest X-ray and possibly a computed tomography angiography (CTA), is needed to determine the cause.

The patient also has asthma, and she will need to start using Advair in"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn day 1.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with copious
   respiratory secretions. Temperature spike O/N and New infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for RLL PNA, for which Vanc/ Zosyn started as empiric
   coverage for HAP.  : Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline
   saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a
   year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge
   documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given
   PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the
   question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing
   e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes
   on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor
   visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due
   to decrease ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - RTC Tylenol
   - CPAP at night
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran for nausea/vomiting
   3. Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   She is now 8 L positive with fluid boluses. Likely post-operative
   causes in combination with opiates and lack of movement.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -d/c Ancef 2mg q6hrs as now on Vanc/ Zosyn
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   .
   7. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. She underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy and was admitted for post-operative hypoxemia. She now presents with evidence of new right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA), which is being treated empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient remains extubated with copious respiratory secretions. Her temperature spiked overnight, and a new infiltrate on the chest X-ray is concerning for RLL PNA.

The patient has a history of baseline oxygen saturation levels between 85-89%, which is consistent with previous hospitalizations but appears to be worse than documented during discharge six weeks ago. Currently, the patient is hypoxic with a PaO2 of only 77 on 50% FiO2, indicating a significant A-a gradient of 220. This raises the question whether this is acute hypoxemia or long-standing, potentially secondary to moderate pulmonary hypertension/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The chest X-ray shows increased lung volumes on the left side, particularly with poor visualization of the left hemidiaphragm, indicating that hypoxia could be due to decreased ventilation of the left lung or hidden pneumonia.

   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- s/p extubation.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 11**] have new RLL pneumonia.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Continue iv fluid repletion
   for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.

   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- s/p extubation.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 11**] have new RLL pneumonia.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Concern for possible
   increased intraabdominal pressure
 check bladder pressure. Continue iv
   fluid repletion for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.  Monitor MAP, maintain MAP> 60
   mmHg.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- remain NPO while surgical ileus persists.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy for a large right adnexal mass. She is currently in the ICU due to post-operative complications.

The patient remains intubated and has evidence of significant A-a (alveolar-arterial) difference on FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 0.5. She was previously evaluated as an inpatient and has known moderate pulmonary hypertension (PA-HTN) by echo last year, but had documented normal oxygen saturation from her inpatient admission last month.

The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to underlying asthma and pulmonary hypertension. She is also experiencing hypoxemia, which is attributed to left lower lobe infiltrate and background of sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. The goal is to maintain SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) >90% and pO2 (partial pressure of oxygen) >60 mmHg. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be considered if the patient remains hypoxemic, along with a repeat cardiac echo to assess right side.

There is also a concern for possible pneumonia due to the left lower lobe infiltrate, likely atelectasis. The patient's oliguria is attributed to hypovolemia and increased intra-abdominal pressure, with a target urine output of 20 cc/hr"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn day 1.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with decreased cough
   and secretions.  Satting well on 4L NC. Per anesthesia, pre-op eval
   revealed baseline saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a
   hospitalization a year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago
   with discharge documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is
   hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This
   raises the question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long
   standing  e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. The patient refusing
   to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP, although
   radiographic findings could also be secondary to atelectasis
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - RTC nebs q4hours
   - Re-start Advair
   - Monitor cough and secretions
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - PCA Morphine (10mg/hr lockout) and RTC Tylenol for pain control
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  The patient was noted to have a Cr bump from 1.1 to
   2.0 today.  Etiology may be pre-renal vs. ATN secondary to hypotension
   post-opeeratively.  UOP continues to be low.  Bladder scan and Foley
   flush did not releval evidence of obstruction.
   -Urine lytes
   -Renal U/S with Dopplers
   -Checj Cr [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   .
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - re-start Advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   7. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI
   8. Anemia
 Hct trending down slowly to 27.3 today.  No evidence of

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, who underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy.
- She was admitted for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with new right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA), on Vancomycin/Zosyn day 1.
- The patient remains extubated, with decreased cough and secretions, but continues to be hypoxic with a PaO2 of only 77 on 50% FiO2.
- There is a significant A-a gradient of 220, raising the question of whether this is acute hypoxemia or long-standing secondary to moderate pulmonary hypertension/OSA.
- The patient refuses to use CPAP at night.
- She has an elevated creatinine level from 1.1 to 2.0 today, which may be due to pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypotension post-operatively.
- The patient continues to have decreased urine output (UOP).
- She is experiencing significant pain and has been started on PCA morphine for pain control.
- The patient has been given Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting.
- The patient has been diagnosed with asthma and has been restarted on Advair.
- Other issues include ovarian mass, post-operative complications, hypertension, diabetes, and anemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn day 1.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with copious
   respiratory secretions. Temperature spike O/N and New infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for RLL PNA, for which Vanc/ Zosyn started as empiric
   coverage for HAP.  : Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline
   saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a
   year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge
   documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given
   PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the
   question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing
   e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes
   on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor
   visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due
   to decrease ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - RTC Tylenol
   - CPAP at night
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran for nausea/vomiting
   3. Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   She is now 8 L positive with fluid boluses. Likely post-operative
   causes in combination with opiates and lack of movement.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -d/c Ancef 2mg q6hrs as now on Vanc/ Zosyn
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   .
   7. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma, who underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with evidence of a new right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). The patient's temperature spike overnight and a new infiltrate on the chest X-ray is concerning for RLL PNA. Empiric coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) was started.

The patient remains extubated with copious respiratory secretions. Her baseline oxygen saturation levels are low, ranging from 85-89%, which is consistent with previous hospitalizations. However, her current PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2 indicates acute hypoxemia. The A-a gradient of 220 raises the question whether this is acute or long-standing, possibly secondary to moderate pulmonary hypertension or OSA. The chest X-ray shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes on the left side, particularly with low endotracheal tube placement and poor visualization of the left hemidiaphragm. This suggests that the hypoxia could be due to decreased ventilation of the left lung or hidden pneumonia.

The patient's abdominal pain is still significant, and she screams"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), asthma, and a large ovarian mass that was surgically removed. She was admitted to the hospital for post-operative hypoxemia and is now experiencing acute renal failure.

The patient's current assessment includes the following:

1. Hypoxemia/PNA: The patient remains extubated but has persistent oxygen requirements. She also has hypercarbia, which is exacerbated by her refusal to use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night. The plan includes continuing vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), obtaining sputum cultures, continuing albuterol nebulizers, starting budesonide nebs, maintaining oxygen saturation above 90%, arranging outpatient pulmonary follow-up, repeating chest X-rays, and considering an echocardiogram as an outpatient.

2. Postoperative Pain Management: The patient is still experiencing significant pain after her total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO) for the ovarian mass. She is sedated and on morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), with Dilaudid given as needed for pain relief. Antiemetics such as Zofran and Compazine are also being administered.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF)/Low Urine Output: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 2.5, indicating acute renal failure. The etiology may be pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension postoperatively. The low urine output persists despite fluid resuscitation. A bladder scan and Foley catheter flush did not reveal any evidence of obstruction. The plan includes monitoring urine output, tolerating output above 20 cc/hr, and continuing renal ultrasound with Doppler studies. Thresholds for intravenous boluses will be lowered.

4. Ovarian Mass/Post-Operative Issues: The patient's ovarian mass pathology results are negative for malignant cells, and the surgical site is being monitored with Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains. Wound care will be performed per surgical recommendations.

5. Asthma: The patient has wheezing bilaterally, indicating asthma exacerbation. The plan includes restarting inhaled corticosteroids (Advair) and providing albuterol nebulizers every four hours while standing.

6. Hypertension: Anti-hypertensive medications are being withheld, but the patient will be restarted if she becomes hypertensive.

7. Diabetes: Glyburide and metformin have been temporarily held, and regular insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control.

8. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with decreased cough
   and secretions.  Satting well on 4L NC. Per anesthesia, pre-op eval
   revealed baseline saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a
   hospitalization a year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago
   with discharge documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is
   hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This
   raises the question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long
   standing  e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. The patient refusing
   to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - RTC nebs q4hours
   - Re-start Advair
   - Monitor cough and secretions
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - PCA Morphine (10mg/hr lockout) and RTC Tylenol for pain control
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   2. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass- Patient still having significant amts
   of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  The patient was noted to have a Cr bump from 1.1 to
   2.0 today.  Etiology may be pre-renal vs. ATN secondary to hypotension
   post-opeeratively.  UOP continues to be low.  Bladder scan and Foley
   flush did not releval evidence of obstruction.
   -Urine lytes
   -Renal U/S with Dopplers
   -Checj Cr [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   .
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - re-start Advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   7. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI
   8. Anemia
 Hct trending down slowly to 27.3 today.  No evidence of
   active bleed
   -Given post-operative, transfuse for Hct goal of 30 or signs of active
   bleed.
   -1 unit pRBCs today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma who underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy. She was admitted for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with new right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA), on vancomycin and Zosyn.

1. Hypoxemia/RLL PNA:
- The patient remains extubated with decreased cough and secretions.
- Oxygen saturation is well maintained on 4L NC.
- Pre-op evaluation revealed baseline saturations of 85-89%.
- Currently, the patient is hypoxic with a PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2, indicating an A-a gradient of 220.
- This raises the possibility of acute hypoxemia or long-standing hypoxemia due to moderate pulmonary hypertension/OSA.
- The patient refuses to use CPAP at night.
- Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for coverage of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Follow up sputum culture.
- Repeat nebs every 4 hours.
- Restart Advair.
- Monitor cough and secretions.
- Maintain SaO2 >90.
- PCA Morphine (10mg/hr lockout) and RTC Tylenol for pain control.
- Need outpatient pulmonary follow-up.
- Consider repeat echo as outpatient.

   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn day 1.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with decreased cough
   and secretions.  Satting well on 4L NC. Per anesthesia, pre-op eval
   revealed baseline saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a
   hospitalization a year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago
   with discharge documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is
   hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This
   raises the question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long
   standing  e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. The patient refusing
   to use CPAP at night.

   - Monitor cough and secretions
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - PCA Morphine (10mg/hr lockout) and RTC Tylenol for pain control
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  The patient was noted to have a Cr bump from 1.1 to
   2.0 today.  Etiology may be pre-renal vs. ATN secondary to hypotension
   post-opeeratively.  UOP continues to be low.  Bladder scan and Foley
   flush did not releval evidence of obstruction.

","Summary:
Ms. [Lastname] is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, who underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy. She is currently admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and new right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). The patient remains extubated with decreased cough and secretions, but is hypoxic with a PaO2 of 77 on 50% FiO2 and an A-a gradient of 220. She is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and her sputum culture is pending. 

She continues to experience significant abdominal pain, especially when turned, and has been started on patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level increase from 1.1 to 2.0 today, possibly due to pre-renal causes or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension postoperatively. Her urine output remains low, and a renal ultrasound with Doppler is planned to further evaluate the situation.

The patient's recent ovarian mass and post-operative issues will be followed up with gynecology/oncology recommendations and pathology results. She also has a history of asthma, hypertension, and diabetes, which require monitoring and management. Her hemoglobin concentration is trending down, and"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), asthma, and a large ovarian mass that underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy. The patient was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypoxemia/Pneumonia (PNA): The patient remains extubated but has persistent oxygen requirements and hypercarbia. There is also a refusal to use CPAP at night. Coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be continued, and sputum cultures should be followed up.

2. Postoperative Pain: The patient is still experiencing significant pain after the total abdominal hysterectomy-bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO) for the ovarian mass. Pain management should be optimized, and sedation should be carefully titrated.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has acute renal failure with low urine output and elevated creatinine levels. It is important to monitor urine output, check electrolytes, and assess for any signs of urinary tract injury from the surgery.

4. Asthma: The patient has wheezing bilaterally, indicating ongoing asthma symptoms. Asthma management should be continued, including the use of Advair, al"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma who underwent an exploratory laparotomy and pancreatectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and is now experiencing acute renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion during the operation. The patient remains anuric with a steadily rising creatinine level from 4.4 to 5.5 today.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 113/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent. The patient is somnolent but easily arousable and oriented. Physical examination reveals rales at the left apex, regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, soft and distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine and BUN, electrolyte imbalances, and low albumin levels.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, albuterol, budesonide nebs, Advair, Dilaudid, and heparin sodium.

The assessment and plan include management of acute renal failure, hypoxemia/pneumonia, constipation, pain management, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, anemia, and ICU care. The patient requires close monitoring and further diagnostic tests such as renal ultrasound, urine cultures, and abdominal/pelvic CT scan. Treatment plans involve fluid boluses for hypotension, antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia, bowel regimen for constipation, pain management, and glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory acidosis, further deterioration of renal function, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), gastrointestinal complications (such as bowel obstruction or perforation), and thromboembolic events (such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism)."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure likely [**2-4**] ATN
   from hypoperfusion during operation.
   1. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated although she has a
   persistent O2 requirement.  The patient has also been hypercarbic, and
   this has been exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Advair
   - continue budesonide nebs
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - repeat CXR
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   - repeat cultures, lactic acid
   2. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass - Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   - apprec. gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  Likely [**2-4**] ARF.  UOP continues to be low.  Likely [**2-4**]
   ATN. No evidence of hydro on limited renal U/S.
   -Urine lytes
   -Check chem 7 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP
   -Use IV boluses PRN for hypotension but not for low urine output
   -Check Cr on JP drain output to assess to urinary tract injury
   (unlikely)
   .
   4. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - continue advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   - budesonide nebs
   .
   5. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma who underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy. She was admitted for post-operative hypoxemia and is now experiencing acute renal failure likely due to ATN from hypoperfusion during the operation. The patient remains extubated with persistent O2 requirement and has been hypercarbic. She refuses to use CPAP at night. Her current medications include Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro for coverage of VAP, albuterol nebs, Advair, budesonide nebs, and Dilaudid PRN for pain management. The patient also has JP drains and wound care per surgery. She is expected to have follow-up with gynecology and oncology as well as pathology results for the ovarian mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemia/PNA: The patient's persistent O2 requirement and refusal to use CPAP at night may indicate ongoing respiratory issues.
2. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass: The patient is still experiencing significant pain, which could be due to post-operative complications or ongoing inflammation.
3. ARF/ Low UOP: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to ATN. Low urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate compromised kidney function.
4. Asthma: The patient has wheezing bilaterally, indicating"

 ACTUE RENAL FAILURE:   Seocndary to ATN in setting of decreased
   perfusion.  Cr continues to rise, oliguric and approaching anuria.
   Muddy brown casts on sediment. Bladder pressures had been in normal
   range.  Renal service following, they will discuss need to start
   dialysis in which case access will need to be obtained.
  DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  RISS
 ANEMIA:  Hct slightly decreased albeit likely dilutional.  Check [**Hospital1 **]
   CBCs.
 ABDOMINAL DISTENTION:  No bowel movement for several days.  Biliious
   material from NGT, large amount.  CT abdomen concerning for early SBO.
   Will continue to monitor, try suppositories.  Probable ileus in postop
   setting and exacerbated by pain meds.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL) s/p exploratory laparotomy.
 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA):  Exacerbated in the setting of pain
   meds with increased pC02 on blood gas. Not compensating appropriately
   in setting of worsening renal function and metabolic acidosis.
   Continue to monitor gases.  Have discussed use of CPAP, patient
   reluctant as it makes her feel her breathing is worse.  Will encourage
   use in the ICU.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE secondary to pneumonia.  Continues on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Remains extubated, no cough or sputum.
   Afebrile.  Still teneuous from a respiratory standpont given
   exacerbation of sleep apnea on pain meds as noted above.  Continue to
   monitor in ICU.
 ASTHMA:  Continues bronchodilators.  No wheeze on exam.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure likely [**2-4**] ATN
   from hypoperfusion during operation.
   1. [**Name (NI) 9213**] pt remains anuric, w steadily rising Cr 5.5 today up from 4.4
   yesterday from baseline around 1.0 Likely etiology of ATN is
   hypoperfusion due to hypotension during operation.
   -- Renal c/s appreciated, will f/u all renal recs, ? possible HD in
   future and HD-access
   -- fluid boluses are for hypotension only as unlikely to affect UOP
   -- check U lytes, chem 7 [**Hospital1 **], monitor UOP
   2. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated although she has a
   persistent O2 requirement.  Has also been hypercarbic, and this has
   been exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP (on day 3 of 8 day
   course, end in 5 days [**11-16**])
   - change zosyn to q8 dosing for renal function, hold vanc for today as
   level 31.2
   - check VBG today
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Advair
   - continue budesonide nebs
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - repeat CXR
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   - repeat cultures, lactic acid
   3. constipation- pt has not had bowel movement since prior to operation
   ~1 wk
   -- PR enemas, tap water enema
   -- ct bowel regimen
   4. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass - Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN (pt very drowsy on this but
   pain better controlled)
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   - apprec. gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   5. ARF/ Low UOP:  Likely [**2-4**] ARF.  UOP continues to be low.  Likely [**2-4**]
   ATN. No evidence of hydro on limited renal U/S.
   -Urine lytes
   -Check chem 7 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP
   -Use IV boluses PRN for hypotension but not for low urine output
   -Check Cr on JP drain output to assess to urinary tract injury
   (unlikely)
   .
   6. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - continue advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   - budesonide nebs
   .
   7. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   8. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - sliding scale insulin
   9. Anemia
 Hct stable.  No evidence of active bleed
   -Given post-operative, transfuse for Hct goal of 30 or signs of active
   bleed.
   -follow Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -CT abd/pelvis to evaluate for intraabdominal bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. She underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy and was admitted for post-operative hypoxemia. She now has acute renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion during the operation.
- The patient remains anuric with a rising creatinine level from 4.4 to 5.5 today, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The likely etiology of ATN is hypoperfusion due to hypotension during the operation.
- Fluid boluses are given for hypotension only and will not affect urine output.
- Check urine electrolytes, chem 7, and monitor urine output.
- The patient has persistent O2 requirements and hypercarbic respiratory failure, exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
- Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for coverage of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Change zosyn to q8 dosing for renal function and hold vancomycin today.
- Check vital blood gases today and follow up with sputum culture.
- Continue albuterol nebs, Advair, and budesonide nebs.
- Maintain SaO2 >90 and consider outpatient pulmonary follow-up.
- Repeat chest X-ray and consider repeat echocardiogram as outpatient.
- Repeat cultures and lactic acid levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma. She underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy and was admitted for post-operative hypoxemia. The patient now presents with acute renal failure likely due to ATN from hypoperfusion during the operation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anuria: The patient remains anuric, indicating a lack of urine output. This could be related to the acute renal failure and ATN.
2. Rising Creatinine Levels: The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily increasing, indicating worsening renal function.
3. Hypoxemia/Pneumonia: The patient has persistent oxygen requirements, indicating ongoing hypoxemia. She also has hypercarbia and may be at risk for pneumonia.
4. Bowel Obstruction or Ileus: The patient has not had a bowel movement since the operation, suggesting a possible post-surgical ileus.
5. Pain Management: The patient is experiencing significant pain but is also quite sedated, which may require adjustments in pain management strategies.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes should be managed with sliding scale insulin due to the current critical condition.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment would be necessary to confirm these findings and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for the patient."

 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Secondary to ATN due to hypotension. BUN/Cr
   continue to rise.  Essentially anuric over past 24 hours.  Renal
   service following along, anticipate initiation of dialysis, will need
   access placed.  Plan to keep in ICU to see if she tolerates initiation
   of dialysis from a hemodynamic standpoint.
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA: As above
 VAP/HYPOXIA:  VAP on antibiotics, holding vanco as level persistently
   high in setting of renal failure.  Also likely splinting from pain
   contributing to atelectasis, hypoventilation.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  On insulin sliding scale.
 ASTHMA:  Stable on bronchodilators.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL): Preliminary path was benign.  Follow up on
   final pathology report.
 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA): Patient refusing to wear CPAP, O2
   nasal cannula.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Adequately controlled on
   dilaudid.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), asthma, who underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy. She was admitted to the hospital for post-operative hypoxemia and is now experiencing acute renal failure likely due to [2-4] acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypoperfusion during the operation. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has undergone her first session on [11-12] with the removal of 2 liters. It is planned for her to undergo a second HD session today.

The patient's respiratory status has improved since being extubated, but she still requires monitoring and treatment for hypoxemia, pneumonia, and asthma. She is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin to cover ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also continues to receive albuterol and budesonide nebs for her asthma.

The patient has not had a bowel movement since the operation, and it is suspected that she has an ileus post-surgery. Bowel sounds have returned, so it is recommended to leave the nasogastric tube (NGT) in place, clamp it, and start a bowel regimen.

The patient is still experiencing significant pain, which is likely due to the surgery. She is being managed with Dilaud"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy and panniculectomy due to a large ovarian mass. The patient was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and is now experiencing acute renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypoperfusion during the operation.

The patient remains anuric (no urine output) with a steadily rising creatinine level of 7.1 today, up from 5.5 yesterday and a baseline of 1.0. The likely etiology of ATN is hypoperfusion due to hypotension during the operation. Hemodialysis (HD) catheter placement has been done today, and the patient will undergo HD after catheter placement. The medical team will continue to monitor urine output and daily creatinine levels.

The patient also has hypoxemia/pneumonia, with persistent oxygen requirements and hypercarbia. She refuses to use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night. The treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Albuterol nebs, Advair, budesonide nebs, and maintaining SaO2 >90 are also part of the management. Pulmonary follow-up is needed, along"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes, obesity, asthma, and a large ovarian mass. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by panniculectomy. She was admitted for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with acute renal failure likely due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypoperfusion during surgery. The patient remains anuric with a steadily rising creatinine level from a baseline of 1.0 to 7.2 today. An arteriovenous catheter has been placed for hemodialysis (HD) and the patient will continue with HD after catheter placement.

The patient also has persistent hypoxemia/pneumonia and requires supplemental oxygen. She has been hypercarbic and this has been exacerbated by refusing to use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night. Antibiotics coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be continued until the end of the 8-day course, and the dosing of Zosyn will be adjusted based on renal function. Blood cultures and peritoneal fluid cultures will be followed up.

The patient has not had a bowel movement since prior to the operation and is likely experiencing post-surgical ileus. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed to assess the bowel. The patient's pain from"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**], a 54-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with acute renal failure likely due to [**2-4**] ATN from hypoperfusion during operation. The patient underwent dialysis catheter placement and had her first dialysis session on [**11-12**], removing 2 liters of fluid. She is currently on hemodialysis and is expected to undergo another session today. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/71 mmHg to 162/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and oriented, but appears to be in pain and is sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has acute renal failure likely caused by ATN during surgery. She is currently on hemodialysis and will likely undergo another session today.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is still requiring supplemental oxygen and has been hypercarbic. She is on antibiotics for coverage of VAP, which is now on day 4 of an 8-day course. Her VBG will be monitored today, and she will continue to receive albuterol nebs, Advair, and budesonide nebs to maintain SaO2 >90%.
3. Bowel Obstruction/Ileus: The patient has not had a bowel movement since the operation, suggesting a possible post-surgical ileus. She will continue with an NGT on suction, NPO, and a bowel regimen including Miralax.
4. Pain Management: The patient is experiencing significant pain but is also quite sedated. Morphine PCA has been discontinued, and Dilaudid will be given as needed. Antiemetics such as Zofran and Compazine will be used for nausea/vomiting.
5. Asthma: The patient's asthma symptoms have improved with greatly diminished wheezing on exam. She will continue with Advair, albuterol q4hrs standing, and budesonide nebs.
6. Hypertension: Anti-hypertensive medications will be held, and re-started if the patient becomes hypertensive.
7. Diabetes: Glyburide and Metformin will be held, and sliding scale insulin will be used for glycemic control.
8. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable with no evidence of active bleed. Follow-up with the hematologist is recommended.
9. Nutrition: TPN will be initiated today.
10. Lines: The patient has a multi-lumen line placed on [**2154-11-6**] at 09:32 PM.
11. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT with SQ UF Heparin, stress ulcers with Lansoprazole, and VAP coverage with Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure likely [**2-4**] ATN
   from hypoperfusion during operation.
   1. ATN
 Patient now on HD, underwent first session on [**11-12**] with
   removal of 2 liters.
   --Will likely undergo 2^nd HD today
   --Appreciate renal recs
   --IVF only as needed for hypotension
   --monitor UOP and renal function
   2. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated, with improved respiratory
   status.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP (on day 5 of 8 day
   course, last day [**11-16**])
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - continue budesonide nebs
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - f/u TTE
   - f/u pending cultures
   3. [**Name (NI) 9241**] pt has not had bowel movement since prior to operation
   ~1 wk.  Likely ileus post-surgically.
   --continue NGT on suction, NPO
   -- ct bowel regimen
   -- add Miralax
   4. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass - Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN (pt very drowsy on this but
   pain better controlled)
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   - apprec. gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   .
   6. Asthma: patient with greatly diminished wheezing on exam
   - continue advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   - budesonide nebs
   .
   7. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   8. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - sliding scale insulin
   9. Anemia
 Hct stable.  No evidence of active bleed
   -follow Hct [**Hospital1 **]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), asthma, and large ovarian mass status post (s/p) ex-lap and panniculectomy. She was admitted to the hospital for post-operative hypoxemia and is now experiencing acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypoperfusion during surgery.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. ATN: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely caused by ATN. She is currently undergoing hemodialysis (HD) sessions to manage her kidney function. It is important to monitor her urine output (UOP) and continue with HD as needed.

2. Hypoxemia/Pneumonia (PNA): The patient remains extubated but still requires respiratory support. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), so she is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. It is crucial to maintain her oxygen saturation level above 90%. Pulmonary function follow-up and further cultures will be necessary.

3. Bowel Ileus: The patient has not had a bowel movement since the operation, indicating a possible post-surgical ileus. Continuous nasogastric tube (NGT) suction, NPO status, and a bowel regimen including laxatives should be continued. Monitoring for any signs of"
