 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   72 year old male with SCC metastatic to left axilla and lung, a fib,
   HTN, HLD, who presents with shortness of breath and weakness.
   .
   # Hypoxia, shortness of breath:  Newly hypoxic w/ pleural effusions,
   consolidation on CT.  Etiology remains unclear, can be cardiogenic in
   the setting of afib, infectious w/ fevers (though no leuks and cough is
   non-productive) in the ED, drug related pneumonitis in the setting of
   experimental drugs, progression of malignancy w/ malignant effusions
   (though time period is too acute for this). ECG w/o evidence of
   ischemia, but will r/o ischemic event. Old echo w/o evidence of
   diastolic or systolic dysfunction.
   - Trial of diuresis, 20mg iv once as he is lasix naive w/ goal of net
   out 1L
   - Add on CEs
   - Echo to eval for newly developed CHF
   - Improve rate control for his afib
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levo can likely narrow within 48hrs pending fever
   curve and culture data
   - Collect sputum for cx if possible
   - F/u respiratory viral panel
   - F/u blood cx
   - F/u with oncology regarding drug reaction
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   # Fever: Febrile in the ED, but has been afebrile in the ICU.  Has been
   afebrile overnight.  Imaging and exam concerning for pneumonia.  Urine
   w/ few bacteria, large amounts of pyuria and leuks. Also with active
   malignancy. No evidence of PE.
   - F/u urine cx
   - F/u blood cx
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levo for now
   - F/u resp viral panel
   - Trend fever curve
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently subtherapeutic.  Will better rate
   control him as he becomes tachy to 150s with mild exertion. Clarified
   home dose coumadin is 7.5mg every other day.
   - Increase coumadin to 5mg daily, monitor INRs while on abx and adjust
   appropriately
   - Switch dilt to QID dose
   - If still tachy will go up on bb for better rate control, BPs will
   likely tolerate this
   - Monitor INR
   .
   # Mucositis: Secondary to chemotherapy.
   - Treat w/ Maalox/Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine
   - Add Caphosol
   - D/c Dexamethasone elixir, as likely exacerbate his thrush
   .
   # Thrush: Small improvement with nystatin. Likely worsened w/ home
   dexamethasone.
   - Switch nystatin to fluconazole
   .
   # Metastatic SCC: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, with metastasis to
   left axilla (s/p left axillary dissection) and pulmonary nodules.
   Patient is s/p resection, XRT, and currently undergoing phase I
   clinical trial treatment with Torisel and Neratinib (though this has
   been held since [**3-9**] given mucositis).
   - F/u on onc recs regarding further treatment
   - Oxycodone prn pain, with bowel regimen
   - Ativan prn anxiety
   - Treat mucositis and thrush as above
   .
   # Anemia: Stable
   - Monitor
   .
   # HTN: BP currently stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, atrial flutter, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with shortness of breath and weakness. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 106/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, atrial flutter, anemia, and mucositis. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's imaging shows multiple pulmonary nodules, a moderate right pleural effusion, atelectasis, and consolidation of the right lower lobe. The patient's plan includes treatment for pneumonia, atrial flutter, mucositis, and thrush, as well as further evaluation for ischemic events and oncology recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Hypoxia: The patient's atrial flutter and right pleural effusion may lead to impaired cardiac function, resulting in decreased oxygenation of the blood.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever suggest a potential infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy, there is an increased risk of opportun"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. The patient has a history of allergies to albuterol and has developed fibrosis. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have an elevated heart rate in the 90s and a slightly low blood pressure. The patient's temperature is within normal range, respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is at 92% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support and their ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance within normal limits. The patient is also experiencing atrial flutter. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's current diagnosis is pneumonia. If not appropriately managed, the infection could worsen, leading to sepsis or respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which can potentially progress to atrial fibrillation. This can result in an irregular heartbeat and may lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not managed properly.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium to prevent DVT. However, there is still a risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially dislodge and cause pulmonary embolism.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of stress ulcers due to critical illness. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is receiving respiratory support, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation and increase the risk of mortality."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of SCC metastatic to the left axilla and lung, atrial flutter, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with shortness of breath and weakness. The patient has been well in the low 90s on 4L NC throughout the night. His acute hypoxia is likely related to consolidation and effusion seen at the R base on CT scan, which is worrisome for pneumonia (with fever) vs progression of malignant disease. The patient is receiving chemotherapy and has been in and out of the oncology clinic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which may be due to an infectious process or progression of malignant disease.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, and his current vital signs show an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. Close monitoring of his cardiac status is necessary.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 92%, indicating potential hypoxia. Oxygen therapy may be required to maintain adequate oxygenation.
4. Metastatic SCC: The patient has metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, with involvement in the left axilla and pulmonary nodules. Ongoing management of this condition is essential.
5. Chemotherapy Side Effects: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy, which can lead to side effects such as mucositis, an"

   .
   # Hypoxia, shortness of breath:  Patient with acutely developed hypoxia
   requiring nasal cannula.  Currently, he remains sating well on 4L nc.
   His CXR and CT chest are notable for newly developed RLL consolidation,
   of note mass seen in RLL on prior CT.  This is concerning for possible
   post-obstructive pneumonia or aspiration event.  As he has been
   receiving chemotherapy within the past 30 days I will cover him for
   health care associated pneumonia.  His imaging is notable for right
   pleural effusion, which could be related to an infectious vs malignant
   process. Cardiac etiology for pleural effusion also possibility, though
   less likely in the absence of acute cardiac event, PE w/ heart strain,
   and history of CHF.  In the setting of active malignancy, PE is also a
   possibility, though he denies chest pain, is not tachycardic, and CTA
   is without evidence of PEs.  Currently he is otherwise hemodynamically
   stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to the left axilla and lung, atrial flutter, hypertension (HTN), and history of coronary heart disease (HLD). He presents with shortness of breath, weakness, and has developed hypoxia requiring nasal cannula oxygen. His chest X-ray and CT scan show newly developed right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, a mass seen in RLL on prior CT, right pleural effusion, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently receiving chemotherapy and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) due to recent chemotherapy treatment. The patient is hemodynamically stable but requires further evaluation and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory distress, sepsis, and acute respiratory failure.
   - Pleural Effusion: The right pleural effusion may worsen or lead to respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.
   - Atelectasis: Consolidation in the RLL may result in atelectasis, further impairing lung function.

2. Cardiac Complications:
   - Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter needs close monitoring, and there is a risk of developing atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias.
   - Cardiac Failure: The patient's"

   # Hypoxia, shortness of breath:  Patient with acutely developed hypoxia
   requiring nasal cannula.  Currently, he remains sating well on 4L nc.
   His CXR and CT chest are notable for newly developed RLL consolidation,
   of note mass seen in RLL on prior CT.  This is concerning for possible
   post-obstructive pneumonia or aspiration event.  As he has been
   receiving chemotherapy within the past 30 days I will cover him for
   health care associated pneumonia.  His imaging is notable for right
   pleural effusion, which could be related to an infectious vs malignant
   process. Cardiac etiology for pleural effusion also possibility, though
   less likely in the absence of acute cardiac event, PE w/ heart strain,
   and history of CHF.  In the setting of active malignancy, PE is also a
   possibility, though he denies chest pain, is not tachycardic, and CTA
   is without evidence of PEs.  Currently he is otherwise hemodynamically
   stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to the left axilla and lung, atrial flutter, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, gout, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presents with shortness of breath and weakness.

The patient has developed hypoxia requiring nasal cannula oxygen and shows signs of pneumonia with right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan. There is also a pleural effusion present, which could be due to an infectious or malignant process. The patient's cardiac history includes atrial flutter, and he is currently on therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin. He is also on multiple medications for his other medical conditions, including chemotherapy for his SCC.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/76 mmHg to 146/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17,700 cells/microliter, elevated lactate levels, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 177,000 cells/m"

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  Patient without productive cough (albeit
   has had upper airway secretions related to thrush/mucocytis), may be at
   risk for aspiration.  Distribution on CT scan not totally consistent
   with this.  WBC normal.  Continue empiric antibiotics, sputum for CT
   scan shows more dependent changes, fluid in fissures, right effusion
   increased suggestive of fluid in lungs.  No edema but does not
   orthopnea for the two nights prior to admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to
   Afib and poor rate control.  Will try to diurese and maintain adequate
   rate control.  Cycle cardiac enzymes albeit no concerning ECG changes
   suggestive of ischemia.  Will repeat echo.  Also receiving chemoRx that
   may be related to pulmonary inflammatory process, concern for drug
   induced pulmonary process.  Seems too fast for progression of mets.
 ATRIAL FIBRILATION/FLUTTER (AFLUTTER):  Poor rate control which may
   be secondary to not getting his meds and volume status.  Subtherapeutic
   on coumadin. Clarified dose with wife and will continue outpatient
   regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of skin cancer (SCCa) that has metastasized to the lung, atrial fibrillation, and is currently on coumadin. He presented with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and orthopnea. He was admitted to the ICU and received supplemental oxygen. The patient developed a tachycardia episode overnight, received an IVF bolus, and his SaO2 improved to 90%. He continues to desaturate with minimal exertion. The patient has thrush and mucocytis, diminished breath sounds at the right base, and no edema in the lower extremities. His neurologic examination is not assessed. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated WBC count, elevated Cr, and subtherapeutic INR levels. The assessment and plan include acute respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and potential causes such as aspiration, pulmonary effusion, poor rate control, and drug-induced pulmonary process.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia due to the risk of aspiration related to the patient's lack of productive cough and presence of thrush/mucocytis.
2. Pulmonary effusion or fluid in the lungs, indicated by the CT scan findings of fluid in fissures and right effusion.
3. Poor rate control of atrial fibrillation/flutter, which may be secondary to not getting his medications and volume status.
4. Drug-induced"

   control him as he becomes tachy to 150s with mild exertion. Clarified
   home dose coumadin is 7.5mg every other day.
   - Increase coumadin to 5mg daily, monitor INRs while on abx and adjust
   appropriately
   - Switch dilt to QID dose
   - If still tachy will go up on bb for better rate control, BPs will
   likely tolerate this
   - Monitor INR

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, atrial flutter, and coronary artery disease. He presents with shortness of breath, weakness, and a recent fever. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly drug-related pneumonitis due to his participation in a phase I clinical trial treatment. There are concerns about congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute respiratory failure. He is currently receiving various treatments including diuretics, antibiotics, and rate control medication for his atrial flutter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can potentially worsen if not adequately treated.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, there is a possibility of CHF, especially considering his history of atrial flutter.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may progress to acute respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.
4. Drug-related Pneumonitis: The patient's recent participation in a clinical trial raises concerns about drug-related pneumonitis as a potential cause of his respiratory symptoms.
5. Malignancy Progression: The patient's metastatic SCC could potentially progress, leading to further complications and symptoms.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which needs to be addressed"

   # Hypoxia, shortness of breath:  Somewhat increasing hypoxia w/
   worsening pleural effusions, consolidation on CT.  Etiology remains
   unclear, can be cardiogenic in the setting of afib, infectious w/
   fevers (though no leuks and cough is non-productive) in the ED, drug
   related pneumonitis in the setting of experimental drugs, progression
   of malignancy w/ malignant effusions (though time period is too acute
   for this). ECG w/o evidence of ischemia, but will r/o ischemic event.
   Old echo w/o evidence of diastolic or systolic dysfunction. Pt
   inadequately diuresed overnight and worsening pleural effusion may be
   cardiogenic.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the left axilla and lung, atrial flutter, hypertension, and a history of heart disease. He presents with shortness of breath, weakness, and fever. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. He also has anemia, hyperlipidemia, gout, and mucositis secondary to chemotherapy. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening pleural effusion and consolidation on CT suggest worsening respiratory failure. This could be due to cardiogenic causes, infectious causes, drug-related pneumonitis, or progression of malignancy. Immediate intensification of diuresis and reassessment with the goal of netting out 1L is recommended.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's increasing hypoxia requires close monitoring and weaning of oxygen as tolerated. If no improvement is seen after diuresis, diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis may be necessary. In severe cases, elective intubation for diagnostic bronchoscopy may be required.

3. Fever: The patient's fever could be due to infection or malignancy. Further evaluation of urine and blood cultures is needed. Continuous monitoring of the fever curve is essential.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is currently"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient has been treated empirically for pneumonia and the condition is worsening despite high FiO2 requirements. The patient also has atrial flutter, and there are concerns about oral thrush/mucocytosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining appropriate head-of-bed elevation and following proper hygiene protocols.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued to prevent clot formation.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers should be administered to prevent these ulcers.

4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged stay in the ICU increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Frequent monitoring of vital signs and regular infection control measures are essential.

5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation and a history of congestive heart failure (CHF). There is a possibility of further cardiac deterioration, and close monitoring of cardiac function is necessary.

6. Renal dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with SCC metastatic to left axilla and lung, a fib,
   HTN, HLD, who presents with shortness of breath and weakness.
   .
   # Hypoxia, shortness of breath:  Somewhat increasing hypoxia w/
   worsening pleural effusions, consolidation on CT.  Etiology remains
   unclear, can be cardiogenic in the setting of afib, infectious w/
   fevers (though no leuks and cough is non-productive) in the ED, drug
   related pneumonitis in the setting of experimental drugs, progression
   of malignancy w/ malignant effusions (though time period is too acute
   for this). ECG w/o evidence of ischemia, but will r/o ischemic event.
   Old echo w/o evidence of diastolic or systolic dysfunction. Pt
   inadequately diuresed overnight and worsening pleural effusion may be
   cardiogenic.
   - Intensify diuresis to 40mg iv once and reassess w/ goal of net out 1L
   - Add on CEs to this AM
s labs for full rule out
   - Improve rate control for his afib by increasing metoprolol from
   37.5mg PO TID to 50mg PO TID
   - Continue dilt 60mg PO QID
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levo can likely narrow within 48hrs pending fever
   curve and culture data
   - Collect sputum for cx if possible
   - F/u respiratory viral culture
   - F/u blood cx
   - F/u with oncology recs
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - If no improvement after diuresis, consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   thoracentesis
   - Ultimately, may need elective intubation for diagnostic bronch as
   this would significantly affect management
   - Family meeting with oncology this PM
   .
   # Fever: Febrile yesterday to 102 and was recultured. Imaging and exam
   concerning for pneumonia.  Urine w/ few bacteria, large amounts of
   pyuria and leuks. Also with active malignancy. No evidence of PE.
   - F/u urine cx
   - F/u blood cx
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levo for now
   - F/u resp viral panel
   - Trend fever curve
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently therapeutic.  Clarified home dose
   coumadin is 7.5mg every other day.
   - Continue coumadin to 5mg daily,
   - Monitor INRs while on abx and adjust appropriately
   - Continue dilt and metoprolol per above
   .
   # Mucositis: Improving significantly. Secondary to chemotherapy.
   - Treat w/ Maalox/Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine
   - Continue Caphosol
   - Continue to hold Dexamethasone elixir, as likely exacerbate his
   thrush
   .
   # Thrush: Small improvement with nystatin. Likely worsened w/ home
   dexamethasone.
   - Continue fluconazole
   .
   # Metastatic SCC: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, with metastasis to
   left axilla (s/p left axillary dissection) and pulmonary nodules.
   Patient is s/p resection, XRT, and currently undergoing phase I
   clinical trial treatment with Torisel and Neratinib (though this has
   been held since [**3-9**] given mucositis).
   - F/u on onc recs regarding further treatment
   - Oxycodone prn pain, with bowel regimen
   - Ativan prn anxiety
   - Treat mucositis and thrush as above
   .
   # Anemia: Stable but slowly trending down.
   - Monitor
   - Low threshold to transfuse as would likely help his dyspnea
   .
   # HTN: BP currently stable.
   - Cont bb
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home statin
   .
   # Gout:
   - Continue allopurinol

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to the left axilla and lung, atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia.
- The patient presents with shortness of breath, weakness, and hypoxia.
- The patient has been febrile and is showing signs of worsening pleural effusion, consolidation on CT scan, and potential pneumonia.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an inflammatory response.
- Urine analysis indicates a few bacteria, large amounts of pyuria (pus in the urine), and leukocytes.
- The patient has mucositis due to chemotherapy, which is improving significantly.
- The patient also has oral thrush, which is being treated with fluconazole.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with medication.
- The patient's anemia is stable but slowly trending down.
- The patient's blood pressure is currently stable.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, diuretics, and other medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, worsening pleural effusion, and consolidation on CT scan suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The presence of fever and elevated inflammatory markers further supports this"

s  note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   Febrile again 101.8.  Recultured, blood and urine.  Coumadin being
   held.  Brief bursts of Aflutter with RVR to 140s.

   fluconazole, lopressor TID.
   72 y/o with metastatic SCC here with hypoxemia and L pleural effusion,
   HAP, rapid Afib.
   Will continue to diurese, antibiotics.  Holding coumadin with plan to
   cover with heparin if INR drifts down, follow effusion with CXR with
   plan to tap by IP if does not resolve.
   On home beta blocker and dilt, liberalize hold parameters to keep Afib
   in control.
   While he still requires monitoring of O2 sats and HR, sats improved and
   has been tolerating nasal cannula without difficulty, bursts of
   tachycardia well tolerated by symptoms and blood pressure.  Stable for
   transfer to OMed.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to the left axilla and lung, atrial flutter, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with shortness of breath and weakness. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and has a pleural effusion. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in his blood, which can lead to impaired tissue oxygenation and organ dysfunction.
2. Pleural Effusion: The accumulation of fluid in the pleural space may compromise lung expansion and function, leading to respiratory distress.
3. Atrial Flutter: This abnormal heart rhythm can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and positive cultures suggest an ongoing infection, which can progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down, indicating a potential decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
6. Gout: The patient is on allopurinol for gout, a condition characterized by painful joint inflammation due to uric acid buildup.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has high cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the left axilla and lung, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial flutter, and gout. He presents with shortness of breath and weakness. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia, pleural effusion, pneumonia, fever, anemia, and mucositis. He is currently receiving treatment for HCAP with antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin) and has a urinary tract infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 126/14 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal urinalysis. The patient's physical examination reveals right lower lobe bronchial breath sounds and improvement in mucositis. The patient's current medications include furosemide, ranitidine, heparin sodium, and prophylactic antibiotics. The plan is to continue diuresis with IV lasix, improve rate control, wean oxygen as tolerated, and continue antibiotics for treatment of HCAP. Potential medical complications include worsening of pneumonia, development of septic shock, worsening of pleural effusion, and further deterioration of renal function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the left axilla and lung, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with shortness of breath and weakness. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), pleural effusion, and mucositis. He is currently receiving treatment for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), blood pressure ranging from 94/62 mmHg to 119/84 mmHg, heart rate between 83 and 151 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and atrial flutter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 93%, indicating potential hypoxemia. This could be due to respiratory failure or pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and is currently receiving antibiotics. If the infection does not improve or worsens, there is a risk of complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a moderate right pleural effusion, which may be caused by malignant effusion, congestive heart failure (CHF), or par"

   72 year old male with SCC metastatic to left axilla and lung, a fib,
   HTN, HLD, who presents with shortness of breath and weakness.
   # Hypoxia
   [**2-26**] pleural effusion, volume overload vs PNA. Therapeutic on coumadin
   and CTA negative for PE.
   - continue diuresis with IV lasix for goal net negative 1L
   - Improve rate control
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levo for treatment of HCAP. Day 1 of all three
   antibiotics is [**2165-3-23**], last dose: [**2165-3-30**]
   - flu negative
   - F/u blood cx
   - F/u with oncology recs
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   # Atrial flutter
   Rates up to 145 if meds held. Asymptomatic.
   - liberalize holding parameters for dilt and lopressor
   - if difficult to control, may change meds to long acting vs stagger
   doses of dilt and lopressor
   - holding coumadin for potential [**Female First Name (un) 231**], bridge for INR < 2
   # Fever:
   Support the diagnosis of PNA as UTI is new. Fever curve trending down.
   Febrile yesterday to 100.4 and was recultured. Urine cx, all negative
   thus far.
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levo to treat HCAP and UTI
   - has h/o recurrent UTI, so may consider broadening if worsens
   # Left pleural effusion
   Concern is for malignant effusion. Oncologist would like it tapped.
   - Holding coumadin
   - continue diuresis
   - Likely [**Female First Name (un) 231**] on the floor
   # Mucositis: Improving significantly. Secondary to chemotherapy.
   - Treat w/ Maalox/Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine
   - Continue Caphosol
   # Thrush:
   - Continue fluconazole
   # Metastatic SCC: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, with metastasis to
   left axilla (s/p left axillary dissection) and pulmonary nodules.
   Patient is s/p resection, XRT, and currently undergoing phase I
   clinical trial treatment with Torisel and Neratinib (though this has
   been held since [**3-9**] given mucositis).
   - F/u on onc recs
   - Oxycodone prn pain, with bowel regimen
   - Ativan prn anxiety
   - Treat mucositis and thrush as above
   # Anemia: Stable but slowly trending down.
   - Monitor
   - Low threshold to transfuse as would likely help his dyspnea
   # HTN: BP currently stable.
   - Cont bb, dilt
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home statin
   # Gout:
   - Continue allopurinol

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) metastatic to the left axilla and lung, atrial flutter, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, and a fib. He presents with shortness of breath, weakness, and pain.

Assessment:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxemia with a SpO2 of 93%. He has a history of pleural effusion and pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, and diuretics are being continued to manage volume overload.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's heart rate is controlled, but there are concerns about controlling the rate. Medications may need to be adjusted or changed to achieve better control.
3. Fever: The patient's fever curve is trending down, indicating improvement. Antibiotics have been initiated for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. Left Pleural Effusion: The patient has a left pleural effusion, which may be malignant in nature. The oncologist wants it tapped for further evaluation.
5. Mucositis: The patient is experiencing mucositis secondary to chemotherapy. Symptomatic treatment is being provided.
6. Thrush: The patient has thrush, for which fluconazole is being continued.
7. Metastatic SCC: The patient has metastatic SCC with pulmonary nodules. Oncology recommendations will be followed,"
