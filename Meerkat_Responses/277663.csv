 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now still
   intubated, on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.
   # Pneumonia: ABg this morning 7.41.44.139.  Seen on OSH CXR as RLL
   infiltrate.  Admitted here on CTX, azithro and clinda.  Currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. Low threshold for adding vanco if worsens. No
   further imaging now, but if does not improve, or worsens, will get CT
   chest to r/o empyema.  Patient agitated overnight requiring boluses of
   iv valium - increased dose range to 20-40mg q15min give hx of EtOh and
   likely withdrawal.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx for narrowing though patient has been on abx for 2 days
   - will r/o for influenza, on droplet precautions
   - urine legionella pending
   - albuterol inh prn
   - wean vent as tolerated, ABG with normal pH, good O2, normal CO2
   - wean off versed drip and use valium boluses only for
   agitation/sedation
   - arterial line placed for BP monitoring
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Was on CIWA scale at OSH.  Became agitated and
   eventually required intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got banana bag
   at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very likely EtOh
   w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or propofol as they
   lower seizure threshold.
   - continue CIWA scale with increased valium boluses as above, goal to
   wean off versed
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - once extubated will need SW c/s for substance abuse
   - LFT

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia. He has been intubated due to his condition and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient is also suspected of having alcohol abuse and is experiencing withdrawal symptoms, as evidenced by increased agitation and the need for benzodiazepine boluses.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/58 to 90/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 54 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 102 mEq/L, oxygen level (PaO2) of 204 mmHg, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 36.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) level, normal platelet (Plt) count, and elevated glucose level. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4), are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of hyperlipidemia, admitted to the ICU for pneumonia. He has been intubated due to alcohol withdrawal and subsequent aspiration event. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation and has arterial line monitoring. He is sedated and agitated, with increased doses of Valium required for sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has shown low blood pressure that responded to a normal saline bolus. His laboratory results indicate normal WBC count, slightly low Hct, slightly high glucose level, and elevated PT/PTT/INR. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, benzodiazepines, and prophylactic treatments for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's condition is concerning for aspiration pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia, with low concern for pseudomonas or MRSA infection. The plan is to continue antibiotics, obtain sputum culture, perform urine Legionella test, and wean off ventilation as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: The patient is showing signs of agitation, which could be due to alcohol withdrawal. This condition can lead to severe complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Aspiration events: Given the patient's history of aspiration and current sedation,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, smoking, and alcohol abuse. He presented with symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, and rigors, which were indicative of right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's condition worsened, leading to increased agitation, respiratory distress, and subsequent intubation. 

The patient received antibiotics, specifically azithromycin, clindamycin, and possibly other medications. He was also given sedatives, including fentanyl, midazolam, and diazepam. Other medications administered include multivitamins, folate, thiamine, proton pump inhibitor (Protonix), heparin, rosuvastatin (RISS), and Lipitor.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal range, blood pressure on the lower side, respiratory rate around 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates fluid balance with total intake of 245 mL and total output of 570 mL. The patient's blood products and urine output are within normal limits.

Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 36, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 30 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, smoking, and alcohol abuse. He presented with symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, and rigors, along with evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. He developed progressive agitation and respiratory distress, leading to intubation. The patient has been in the ICU since then.

24-Hour Events:
- The patient experienced increased agitation overnight, and Valium was titrated up.
- Vital signs remained stable, with a slight decrease in blood pressure.
- The patient received antibiotics, including azithromycin, clindamycin, and others.
- Fluid balance showed an intake of 2,600 mL and output of 570 mL.
- Respiratory support included ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory system compliance of 45.8 cmH2O/mL, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 204.
- Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally.
- Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.9 g/dL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 250 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient's platelet count decreased from 221 K/uL to 199 K/uL.

 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now still
   intubated, on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Pt was on CIWA scale at OSH where he became
   agitated eventually requiring intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got
   banana bag at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very
   likely EtOh w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or
   propofol as they lower seizure threshold. Pt still in withdrawal will
   try and wean off diazepam.
   - continue CIWA scale with valium boluses as above, goal to wean off
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - once extubated will need SW c/s for substance abuse
   #. Bactermia: Last night pt
s bld culture x 2 bottle showed GPC in
   clusters and chains. Pt currently on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin which
   provides adequate coverage for Staph/Strep. If pt decompensates would
   consider adding Vancomycin to his regimen for MRSA coverage. Will f/u
   on speciation and sensitivities.
 f/u cultures speciation and sensitivities
 Will narrow down abx spectrum following sensitivities
 Consider adding Vancomycin for MRSA coverage if pt decompensates.
   #. Hypoxia: Pt was noted to be hypoxic to the mid 80s last night which
   appeared to resolve following suction of a mucous plug. Again this
   morning he desaturated to 89%, CXR x 2 obtained which showed no
   interval worsening of parenchymal appearance. PEEP increased from 5 to
   10 which helped oxygenation, ?hypoxic event may be [**3-14**] atelectasis. Pt
   showed no unstable BP, tachycardia or change in lung volumes or peak
   pressures.
 ? atelectasis as cause of hypoxia given improvement with increased
   PEEP, CXR that shows parenchymal improvement.
   # Pneumonia: Currently on CTX, azithro and clinda and currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. If pt starts to decompensate would consider adding
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage. Will resend a DFA as there were not
   enough cells in the last sample.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx for narrowing though patient has been on abx for 2 days
   - will recheck DFA today, continue droplet precautions
   - albuterol inh prn

   - wean off diazepam boluses
   - arterial line placed for BP monitoring
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue home statin.
   #. History of Cocaine Abuse:
   - u tox pending
   - no beta blocker
   # Etoh Abuse: Pt
s family are interested in any resources to help pt
   with his Etoh Abuse. Pt once extubated and more coherent will need
   extensive social work up for detox placement as well as a visit with
   the addiction specialists.

 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now still
   intubated, on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Pt was on CIWA scale at OSH where he became
   agitated eventually requiring intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got
   banana bag at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very
   likely EtOh w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or
   propofol as they lower seizure threshold. Pt still in withdrawal will
   try and wean off diazepam.
   - continue CIWA scale with valium boluses as above, goal to wean off
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - once extubated will need SW c/s for substance abuse
   #. Bactermia: Last night pt
s bld culture x 2 bottle showed GPC in
   clusters and chains. Pt currently on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin which
   provides adequate coverage for Staph/Strep. If pt decompensates would
   consider adding Vancomycin to his regimen for MRSA coverage. Will f/u

 f/u cultures speciation and sensitivities
 Will narrow down abx spectrum following sensitivities
 Consider adding Vancomycin for MRSA coverage if pt decompensates.
   #. Hypoxia: Pt was noted to be hypoxic to the mid 80s last night which
   appeared to resolve following suction of a mucous plug. Again this
   morning he desaturated to 89%, CXR x 2 obtained which showed no
   interval worsening of parenchymal appearance. PEEP increased from 5 to
   10 which helped oxygenation, ?hypoxic event may be [**3-14**] atelectasis. Pt
   showed no unstable BP, tachycardia or change in lung volumes or peak
   pressures.
 ? atelectasis as cause of hypoxia given improvement with increased
   PEEP, CXR that shows parenchymal improvement.
   # Pneumonia: Currently on CTX, azithro and clinda and currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. If pt starts to decompensate would consider adding
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage. Will resend a DFA as there were not
   enough cells in the last sample.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx for narrowing though patient has been on abx for 2 days
   - will recheck DFA today, continue droplet precautions
   - albuterol inh prn
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - wean off diazepam boluses
   - arterial line placed for BP monitoring
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue home statin.
   #. History of Cocaine Abuse:
   - u tox pending
   - no beta blocker
   # Etoh Abuse: Pt
s family are interested in any resources to help pt
   with his Etoh Abuse. Pt once extubated and more coherent will need
   extensive social work up for detox placement as well as a visit with

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of hyperlipidemia, who was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia (PNA) and was intubated due to alcohol withdrawal (EtOH w/d) and subsequent aspiration event. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (CTX, azithro, and clinda) and intubated. The PORT score indicates a mortality risk of >2.8%. Aspiration PNA is a concern, but there is also a possibility of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) given the initial presentation. There is low concern for pseudomonas or MRSA infection. If the patient starts to decompensate, Vancomycin may be considered for MRSA coverage. Continued antibiotic therapy with typical, atypical, and anerobic coverage is recommended.

2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has been experiencing increasing agitation, which necessitates benzodiazepine treatment for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Diazepam boluses will be given as needed to manage withdrawal symptoms. Once extubated, the patient will need social work counseling for substance abuse and a visit with addiction specialists.

3. Hypoxia: The patient experienced hypoxia twice, with saturation levels in the mid-80s and 89%. These events appeared to resolve after suctioning a mucous plug."

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now still
   intubated, on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.
   # Pneumonia: ABg this morning 7.41.44.139.  Seen on OSH CXR as RLL
   infiltrate.  Admitted here on CTX, azithro and clinda.  Currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. Low threshold for adding vanco if worsens. No
   further imaging now, but if does not improve, or worsens, will get CT
   chest to r/o empyema.  Patient agitated overnight requiring boluses of
   iv valium - increased dose range to 20-40mg q15min give hx of EtOh and
   likely withdrawal.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx for narrowing though patient has been on abx for 2 days
   - will r/o for influenza, on droplet precautions
   - urine legionella pending
   - albuterol inh prn
   - wean vent as tolerated, ABG with normal pH, good O2, normal CO2
   - wean off versed drip and use valium boluses only for
   agitation/sedation
   - arterial line placed for BP monitoring
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Was on CIWA scale at OSH.  Became agitated and
   eventually required intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got banana bag
   at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very likely EtOh
   w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or propofol as they
   lower seizure threshold.
   - continue CIWA scale with increased valium boluses as above, goal to
   wean off versed
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - once extubated will need SW c/s for substance abuse
   - LFT
s at OSH wnl, will recheck here
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue home statin.
   #. History of Cocaine Abuse:
   - u tox pending
   - no beta blocker

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia.
- He was admitted to the OSH ICU for pneumonia and experienced ethanol withdrawal, leading to intubation.
- He remains intubated and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient has a confirmed right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and an elevated PORT score indicating high mortality risk.
- There is concern for aspiration pneumonia due to agitation, but also possible community-acquired pneumonia.
- Low concern for pseudomonas or MRSA infection.
- The patient required increased doses of IV Valium overnight for agitation, likely related to ethanol withdrawal.
- Plan: Continue antibiotics, consider adding vancomycin if the patient worsens, obtain sputum culture, rule out influenza, and perform urine legionella test.
- Wean ventilator as tolerated, monitor ABG, and wean off Versed drip while using Valium boluses for agitation/sedation.
- Arterial line placed for blood pressure monitoring.
- The patient is also being treated for alcohol withdrawal with increased Valium boluses, avoiding Haldol or propofol due to lower seizure threshold.
- Once extubated, the patient will need substance abuse counseling, recheck liver function tests, and continue home statin for hyperlipidemia.
- History of cocaine abuse, urine toxicology pending.
- No beta-blocker.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure due to pneumonia and underlying smoking history, along with mental status changes from alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine treatment. 

The patient has been receiving respiratory support through mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 148, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C, heart rate between 57-107 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 66-87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, elevated potassium level of 5.6 mg/dL, and normal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci clusters, indicating a bacterial infection.

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now still
   intubated, on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Pt was on CIWA scale at OSH where he became
   agitated eventually requiring intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got
   banana bag at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very
   likely EtOh w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or
   propofol as they lower seizure threshold. Pt still in withdrawal will
   try and wean off diazepam.
   - continue CIWA scale with valium boluses as above, goal to wean off
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - once extubated will need SW c/s for substance abuse
   #. Bactermia: Last night pt
s bld culture x 2 bottle showed GPC in
   clusters and chains. Pt currently on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin which
   provides adequate coverage for Staph/Strep. If pt decompensates would
   consider adding Vancomycin to his regimen for MRSA coverage. Will f/u
   on speciation and sensitivities.
   - f/u cultures speciation and sensitivities
   -Will narrow down abx spectrum following sensitivities
   - Consider adding Vancomycin for MRSA coverage if pt decompensates.
    #. Hypoxia: Pt was noted to be hypoxic to the mid 80s last night which
   appeared to resolve following suction of a mucous plug. Again this
   morning he desaturated to 89%, CXR x 2 obtained which showed no
   interval worsening of parenchymal appearance. PEEP increased from 5 to
   10 which helped oxygenation, ?hypoxic event may be [**3-14**] atelectasis. Pt
   showed no unstable BP, tachycardia or change in lung volumes or peak
   pressures.
   -? atelectasis as cause of hypoxia given improvement with increased
   PEEP, CXR that shows parenchymal improvement.
   # Pneumonia: Currently on CTX, azithro and clinda and currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. If pt starts to decompensate would consider adding
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage. Will resend a DFA as there were not
   enough cells in the last sample.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx for narrowing though patient has been on abx for 2 days
   - will recheck DFA today, continue droplet precautions

   # Etoh Abuse: Pt
s family are interested in any resources to help pt

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of hyperlipidemia, admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and EtOH withdrawal. He was intubated due to agitation and aspiration, and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and CIWA scale. The patient's current condition shows improvement with increased PEEP, but he remains hypoxic and intubated. There are concerns about alcohol withdrawal, pneumonia, and potential complications such as bacteremia and MRSA coverage. The patient's blood culture showed GPC in clusters and chains, and he is currently on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin. The patient also has a history of cocaine abuse and EtOH abuse, with plans for social work up for detox placement and addiction specialists' visit once extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is still in withdrawal and may continue to experience agitation. Treatment involves benzodiazepines, specifically valium boluses to wean off diazepam.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to his recent aspiration event. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic coverage and monitor for any worsening of symptoms.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypoxia, which may be due to atelectasis or another underlying cause. Increasing PEEP has helped improve oxygenation, but further investigation is needed"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now still
   intubated, on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.  RSBI 18,
   signiifcantly mor alert this morning.
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Pt was on CIWA scale at OSH where he became
   agitated eventually requiring intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got
   banana bag at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very
   likely EtOh w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or
   propofol as they lower seizure threshold. Pt still in withdrawal will
   try and wean off diazepam.  Last dose of valium was at 10pm last night,
   off of sedation currently.
   - continue CIWA scale with valium boluses as above, goal to wean off
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - once extubated will need SW c/s for substance abuse
   #. Bactermia: Blood culture from [**2-16**] x 2 bottle showed GPC in clusters
   and chains. Pt currently on Ceftriaxone, azithro and Clindamycin which
   provides adequate coverage for Staph/Strep. If pt decompensates would
   consider adding Vancomycin to his regimen for MRSA coverage. Will f/u
   on speciation and sensitivities.
   - f/u cultures speciation and sensitivities
   -Will narrow down abx spectrum following sensitivities
   - Consider adding Vancomycin for MRSA coverage if pt decompensates.
    #. Hypoxia: Improving.  Now on PSV, on 0 of PEEP, RSMBI 18.  2 nights
   ago, he was noted to be hypoxic to the mid 80s last night which
   appeared to resolve following suction of a mucous plug. Yesterday he
   desaturated to 89%, CXR x 2 obtained which showed no interval worsening
   of parenchymal appearance. PEEP increased from 5 to 10 which helped
   oxygenation, ?hypoxic event may be [**3-14**] atelectasis. Pt showed no
   unstable BP, tachycardia or change in lung volumes or peak pressures.
   - given excellent improvement in respiratory status and maintaining
   well on PSV, plan to extubate this morning
   # Pneumonia: Currently on CTX, azithro and clinda and currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. If pt starts to decompensate would consider adding
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage. Will resend a DFA as there were not
   enough cells in the last sample.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx pending
   - DFA negative
   - albuterol inh prn
   - extubate as above
   - wean off diazepam boluses
   - can d/c a-line once extubated
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue home statin.
   #. History of Cocaine Abuse:
   - u tox pending
   - no beta blocker
   # Etoh Abuse: Pt
s family are interested in any resources to help pt
   with his Etoh Abuse. Pt once extubated and more coherent will need
   extensive social work up for detox placement as well as a visit with
   the addiction specialists.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of hyperlipidemia, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for pneumonia (PNA) and ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. He was intubated due to aspiration and agitation, and placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 18. His blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in clusters and chains, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The patient is currently receiving ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and clindamycin for coverage against Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate between 68-103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/55-150/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, good air movement in the lungs, and mild lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated blood glucose level. Other lab values are within normal ranges. A chest X-ray was obtained, but the image is not provided in the progress note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, possibly exacerbated by alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine treatment. The patient's mental status changes are attributed to ethanol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/62 to 151/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has increased from 70 kg at admission to 79.3 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,047 mL with outputs totaling 1,028 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and diazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia. The ongoing antibiotic treatment should help resolve the infection. However, the patient may develop complications such as worsening lung function, sepsis, or multi-organ dysfunction due to the severity of the infection.
2. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing mental status changes likely due to ethanol withdrawal. It is important to continue sedation per CIWA protocol and closely monitor the patient for any signs of severe withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures or delirium tremens.
3. Benzodiazepine Weaning: The patient is currently receiving"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now still
   intubated, on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.  RSBI 18,
   signiifcantly mor alert this morning.
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Pt was on CIWA scale at OSH where he became
   agitated eventually requiring intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got
   banana bag at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very
   likely EtOh w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or
   propofol as they lower seizure threshold. Pt still in withdrawal will
   try and wean off diazepam.  Last dose of valium was at 10pm last night,
   off of sedation currently.
   - continue CIWA scale with valium boluses as above, goal to wean off
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - once extubated will need SW c/s for substance abuse
   #. Bactermia: Blood culture from [**2-16**] x 2 bottle showed GPC in clusters
   and chains. Pt currently on Ceftriaxone, azithro and Clindamycin which
   provides adequate coverage for Staph/Strep. If pt decompensates would
   consider adding Vancomycin to his regimen for MRSA coverage. Will f/u
   on speciation and sensitivities.
   - f/u cultures speciation and sensitivities
   -Will narrow down abx spectrum following sensitivities
   - Consider adding Vancomycin for MRSA coverage if pt decompensates.
    #. Hypoxia: Improving.  Now on PSV, on 0 of PEEP, RSMBI 18.  2 nights
   ago, he was noted to be hypoxic to the mid 80s last night which
   appeared to resolve following suction of a mucous plug. Yesterday he
   desaturated to 89%, CXR x 2 obtained which showed no interval worsening
   of parenchymal appearance. PEEP increased from 5 to 10 which helped
   oxygenation, ?hypoxic event may be [**3-14**] atelectasis. Pt showed no
   unstable BP, tachycardia or change in lung volumes or peak pressures.
   - given excellent improvement in respiratory status and maintaining
   well on PSV, plan to extubate this morning
   # Pneumonia: Currently on CTX, azithro and clinda and currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. If pt starts to decompensate would consider adding
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage. Will resend a DFA as there were not
   enough cells in the last sample.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx pending
   - DFA negative
   - albuterol inh prn
   - extubate as above
   - wean off diazepam boluses
   - can d/c a-line once extubated
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue home statin.
   #. History of Cocaine Abuse:
   - u tox pending
   - no beta blocker
   # Etoh Abuse: Pt
s family are interested in any resources to help pt
   with his Etoh Abuse. Pt once extubated and more coherent will need
   extensive social work up for detox placement as well as a visit with
   the addiction specialists.

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now s/p extubation
   yesterday with 2 bottles + Coag neg staph and +GPC bld cultures,
   currently on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Pt was on CIWA scale at OSH where he became
   agitated eventually requiring intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got
   banana bag at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very
   likely EtOh w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or
   propofol as they lower seizure threshold. Pt has required less Diazepam
   with lower CIWA scores over the past 24 hours. Received 10mg this AM
   after appearing diaphoretic.
   - continue CIWA scale with valium PO, though currently pt has required
   less, likely withdrawal is complete, likely call out to floor later
   today if bed needed.
   - will continue thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - SW consult for substance abuse
   #. Bactermia: Blood culture from [**2-15**] x 1 bottle and [**2-17**] x 2 bottles
   speciated to Coag negative staph sensitive to Vancomycin. Pt currently
   on Ceftriaxone day #5, azithro day #5 and Clindamycin #5. Based on the
   bld cultures will start Vancomycin today. Coag negative staph are +
   from cultures on admission to ICU from OSH. Pt currently has a PICC
   line that was placed after the first positive bld [**Last Name (LF) 4945**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] however
   draw cultures from PICC and peripheral line. Will d/c Azithromycin as
   pt has completed which provides adequate coverage for Staph/Strep. If
   pt decompensates would consider adding Vancomycin to his regimen for
   MRSA coverage. Will f/u on speciation and sensitivities.
   - f/u cultures speciation and sensitivities
   -Will narrow down abx spectrum following sensitivities
   - Consider adding Vancomycin for MRSA coverage if pt decompensates.
    #. Hypoxia: Improving.  Now on PSV, on 0 of PEEP, RSMBI 18.  2 nights
   ago, he was noted to be hypoxic to the mid 80s last night which
   appeared to resolve following suction of a mucous plug. Yesterday he
   desaturated to 89%, CXR x 2 obtained which showed no interval worsening
   of parenchymal appearance. PEEP increased from 5 to 10 which helped
   oxygenation, ?hypoxic event may be [**3-14**] atelectasis. Pt showed no
   unstable BP, tachycardia or change in lung volumes or peak pressures.
   - given excellent improvement in respiratory status and maintaining
   well on PSV, plan to extubate this morning
   # Pneumonia: Currently on CTX, azithro and clinda and currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. If pt starts to decompensate would consider adding
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage. Will resend a DFA as there were not
   enough cells in the last sample.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx pending
   - DFA negative
   - albuterol inh prn
   - extubate as above
   - wean off diazepam boluses
   - can d/c a-line once extubated
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue home statin.
   #. History of Cocaine Abuse:
   - u tox pending
   - no beta blocker
   # Etoh Abuse: Pt
s family are interested in any resources to help pt
   with his Etoh Abuse. Pt once extubated and more coherent will need
   extensive social work up for detox placement as well as a visit with
   the addiction specialists.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia and alcohol abuse. The patient was extubated successfully and is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/64 mmHg to 156/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has increased from 70 kg at admission to 79.3 kg currently.

The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and azithromycin. They are also receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,108 mL, including 675 mL of IV fluids, 300 mL of PO intake, 299 mL of TF intake, and 709 mL of IVF intake. The total output includes 1,630 mL of urine output, -522 mL of fluid balance deficit, and 95 mL of NG output.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 287 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 219 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 0.9 mg/dL, TCO2 at 28, glucose at 154 mg/dL, and slightly elevated levels of potassium (K+) at 5.1 mEq/L. Other lab values appear within normal ranges.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, which is a lung infection. There is a risk of developing further infections while in the ICU, especially if proper infection control measures are not maintained.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a concern for the development of blood clots in the veins.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, suggesting a risk of developing ulcers due to stress or critical illness.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was intubated and received mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection acquired during or after mechanical ventilation.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a deficit of 522 mL, but there is still a significant amount of fluid intake compared to output. This may indicate a risk of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and other complications.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of these potential complications and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage them."

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   58 yo M with PMH of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH ICU where he
   was admitted for PNA, had EtOH w/d, was intubated.  Now still
   intubated, on broad spectrum abx and CIWA scale.  RSBI 18,
   signiifcantly mor alert this morning.
   # Alcohol Withdrawal:  Pt was on CIWA scale at OSH where he became
   agitated eventually requiring intubation ? [**3-14**] aspiration event. Got
   banana bag at OSH.  Increasing agitation overnight, BP's stable, very
   likely EtOh w/d - treatment is benzos.  Would not give haldol or
   propofol as they lower seizure threshold. Pt still in withdrawal will
   try and wean off diazepam.  Last dose of valium was at 10pm last night,
   off of sedation currently.
   - continue CIWA scale with valium boluses as above, goal to wean off
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
 MCV 107 on admission
   - once extubated will need SW c/s for substance abuse
   #. Bactermia: Blood culture from [**2-16**] x 2 bottle showed GPC in clusters
   and chains. Pt currently on Ceftriaxone, azithro and Clindamycin which
   provides adequate coverage for Staph/Strep. If pt decompensates would
   consider adding Vancomycin to his regimen for MRSA coverage. Will f/u
   on speciation and sensitivities.
   - f/u cultures speciation and sensitivities
   -Will narrow down abx spectrum following sensitivities
   - Consider adding Vancomycin for MRSA coverage if pt decompensates.
    #. Hypoxia: Improving.  Now on PSV, on 0 of PEEP, RSMBI 18.  2 nights
   ago, he was noted to be hypoxic to the mid 80s last night which
   appeared to resolve following suction of a mucous plug. Yesterday he
   desaturated to 89%, CXR x 2 obtained which showed no interval worsening
   of parenchymal appearance. PEEP increased from 5 to 10 which helped
   oxygenation, ?hypoxic event may be [**3-14**] atelectasis. Pt showed no
   unstable BP, tachycardia or change in lung volumes or peak pressures.
   - given excellent improvement in respiratory status and maintaining
   well on PSV, plan to extubate this morning
   # Pneumonia: Currently on CTX, azithro and clinda and currently
   intubated. PORT score 108 giving him >2.8% mortality.  Aspiration PNA
   concerning given agitation, but also could be CAP given initial
   presentation.  Low concern for pseudomonas as not recently
   hospitalized, low concern for MRSA as not diabetic or
   immunocompromised. If pt starts to decompensate would consider adding
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage. Will resend a DFA as there were not
   enough cells in the last sample.
   - continue abx - has good typical, atypical and anerobic coverage,
   would consider Vanco if worsens
   - sputum cx pending
   - DFA negative
   - albuterol inh prn
   - extubate as above
   - wean off diazepam boluses
   - can d/c a-line once extubated
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue home statin.
   #. History of Cocaine Abuse:
   - u tox pending
   - no beta blocker
   # Etoh Abuse: Pt
s family are interested in any resources to help pt
   with his Etoh Abuse. Pt once extubated and more coherent will need
   extensive social work up for detox placement as well as a visit with
   the addiction specialists.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of hyperlipidemia, admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He required intubation due to aspiration and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8Â°C, blood pressure ranging from 147/75 to 156/108 mmHg, heart rate between 71-110 bpm, respiratory rate at 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's neurologic examination shows that he opens his eyes and responds with questions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia with antibiotics, but there is still a concern for aspiration pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia. If the patient's condition worsens, additional coverage may be needed, such as adding Vancomycin for MRSA coverage.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and benzodiazepines are being used for treatment. The goal is to wean off diazepam boluses.
3. Hypoxia: The patient had episodes of hypoxia, which improved after suctioning a mucous plug. It is possible that the hypoxic event was due to atelectasis. The plan is to extubate the patient since their respiratory status is improving.
4. Bacteremia: Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in clusters"
