","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old male with no prior medical history who was admitted with severe acute renal failure, volume overload, and hemolysis. The patient has undergone several interventions including hemodialysis (HD), placement of a dialysis catheter, and administration of medications such as nitroglycerin, propofol, labetalol, and hydralazine.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.7°C (99.9°F), while the blood pressure is high at 150/80 mmHg. The heart rate is within normal range at 74 bpm, and the respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1620 mL with an output of 2483 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 863 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The spontaneous respiratory rate is not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated potassium level, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The platelet count"

   Assessment and Plan
   26 yo M with no PMH admitted with respiratory failure and marked acute
   renal failure of unknown etiology.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: patient is clearly volume overloaded likely
   secondary to acute renal failure. It is unclear at this time if there
   is also a component of primary pulmonary disease within the spectrum of
   a systemic vasculitis resulting in alveolitis or focal/DAH and this
   would aid in distinguishing some of the DDx listed below. Currently,
   the patient is intubated. Would initiate ARDSnet ventilation until we
   have a better idea what his lung compliance is.
   - ventilate with volumes of [**5-19**] mL/kg
   - switch to fent/midaz
   - a line

   # Acute Renal Failure: the patient meets all but one of the indications
   for dialysis (acidosis, electrolyte derangements, overload and uremia)
   and at this point requires volume removal emergently given his
   respiratory failure and hypertension. Renal will be coming in to place
   a line and to initiate RRT. Etiologies at this time include TTP/HUS,
   vasculitic process including Wegener's, microscopic polyangiitis,
   Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 614**] (but no eos on peripheral smear), HSP (no skin findings
   on exam), Cryoglobulinemia (but he is young for this dx), anti-GBM,
   Goodpasture's. SLE is also on the differential at this time. UA with
   large blood and 500 protein is indicative of a glomerulonephritis, but
   will need to look for dyspmorphic red cells/red cell casts on sediment.

   # Hypertensive Emergency: on nitro gtt, but should be able to wean with
   fent/versed. Needs HD for acute management. CT head without obvious
   bleed but poor study, may need to repeat.
   - caution with lowering too quickly, unclear what his baseline
   pressures are
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis - AG is 20, and delta-delta is 1.6,
   indicating a pure AG metabolic acidosis (although given the renal
   failure there is likely a component of NG acidosis as well). This is
   most likely due to uremia at this time. Needs HD.
   - check ABG and adjust vent to help with acid/base status for now
   .
   # Elevated CE's: patient is very volume overloaded, so likely etiology
   is significant strain, however, can consider myocarditis in the setting
   of vasculitis, specifically Wegener's. EKG with nonspecific findings
   but no evidence of acute ischemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old male with respiratory failure and acute renal failure of unknown etiology. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has a history of small echogenic kidneys on ultrasound, received 2 units of packed red blood cells yesterday morning, and started on hemodialysis (HD) with 2 liters taken off. He was also given labetalol 10mg once for elevated blood pressure last night. Sedation was changed from fentanyl/versed to propofol for planned attempted extubation this morning.

The patient's allergies are not documented in the progress note. He is receiving nitroglycerin at 1.4 mcg/kg/min and propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include hydralazine at 10:00 PM on 03/22/2100, and labetalol at 04:59 AM on 03/23/2100.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure and acute renal failure. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,620 mL and total output of 2,483 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -863 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a chief complaint of renal and respiratory failure. The patient was admitted with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, uremia, and marked acute renal failure, as well as hypertension. The patient has a history of no previous medical history (PMH), but presents with anemia, mild hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia.

24-hour events include an ultrasound showing small kidneys suggesting chronic kidney disease, initiation of dialysis catheter, and improvement in chest X-ray after removing 2 liters of fluid during hemodialysis. The patient's blood pressure has been high around 180 throughout the day, leading to the suspicion of chronic hypertension causing chronic kidney disease in a young patient. Blood pressure was kept between 140-160 with nitro drip and labetalol.

The patient passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning and has good mental status. The patient's allergies are not mentioned, and the last dose of antibiotics was given.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with pinpoint pupils. The neck veins are distended up to 9 cm, and there are no lung abnormal findings except for rhonchi. The heart sounds are regular with normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with present bowel sounds, and no rebound tenderness, guarding, or organomegaly"

   26 yo M with no PMH admitted with respiratory failure, marked acute
   renal failure, HTN emergency, pink frothy sputum vs hemoptysis, nose
   bleed of unknown etiology.  Patient with presentation with profound new
   onset acute renal failure with likely associated pulmonary edema,
   bleeding, hyperkalemia, anemia, uremia.  Of note he does have
   significant Pancytopenia and with shistocytes noted upon peripheral
   smear.  This raises the issue of possible TTP/HUS and hematology has
   been evaluated for possible diagnosis on this front with smear findings
   showing low grade hemolysis.
   Acute Renal Failure-
   -Differential diagnosis is extensive
vasculitis is certainly likely
   with extensive evaluation sent.  No RBC casts seen, small kidneys note
   on ultrasound.  No obstruction suggested with foley placement to
   suggest obstruction and no hydronephrosis seen.  TTP/HUS unlikely with
   such dense renal failure and minimal thrombocytopenia
   -HD today
   -Continue daily dialysis depending on response to initial intervention
   Respiratory Failure
Acute-
   -Secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of significant volume
   overload and pulmonary edema
   -Doubt DAH as significant clearing with dialysis
   Pancytopenia
most prominently anemia which may be related to renal
   failure
   -Hemolysis modest

","The patient is a 26-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure, marked acute renal failure, hypertension, and nosebleeds of unknown etiology. The patient presents with profound new-onset acute renal failure with associated pulmonary edema, bleeding, hyperkalemia, anemia, and uremia. There are also findings of pancytopenia and schistocytes noted upon peripheral smear, raising the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). 

The differential diagnosis for acute renal failure includes vasculitis, TTP/HUS, and obstructive causes. However, TTP/HUS is unlikely due to the dense renal failure and minimal thrombocytopenia. Obstructive causes have been ruled out with the placement of a Foley catheter and absence of hydronephrosis on ultrasound. 

The patient requires daily dialysis depending on the response to initial intervention. The respiratory failure is secondary to pulmonary edema due to significant volume overload. 

Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the pancytopenia, including follow-up with the hematological team's recommendations. Additional tests such as DSA, ANCA, anti-GBM, SLE, Hep B/C serology, and cryo levels should be performed to rule out vasculitis. A CT chest and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be done to differentiate between"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old male with no prior medical history who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by pulmonary edema, uremia, and acute renal failure. The patient also has hypertension and anemia with evidence of mild hemolysis and thrombocytopenia.

Key Findings:
- Renal ultrasound showed small kidneys, suggesting chronic kidney disease.
- Chest X-ray improved after removing fluid from the lungs during dialysis.
- Blood pressure readings were high around 180 throughout the day, raising the possibility of chronic hypertension causing chronic kidney disease.
- The patient passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning, indicating good mental status and the possibility of extubation.
- The patient has grey thick sputum and pinpoint pupils, which may indicate opioid use or opioid overdose.
- Neurological examination revealed clonus at the ankles.
- Laboratory results showed elevated levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), along with low levels of hemoglobin, platelets, and albumin.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal failure, acute: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypertension and possibly intrinsic or extrinsic causes.
2. Anemia, other: The patient has anemia with evidence of mild hemolysis and thrombocytopenia.
3. Hypertension, benign: The patient has hypertension that"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 26-year-old male with no prior medical history, was admitted with severe acute renal failure, volume overload, and hemolysis. The patient's renal function has improved after initiating hemodialysis (HD), and electrolyte derangements have been corrected. The patient underwent extubation yesterday and is currently doing well. The etiology of respiratory failure is believed to be flash pulmonary edema secondary to malignant hypertension. The patient's hypertensive emergency has resolved, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which may include renal artery stenosis (RAS) or vasculitis. The patient exhibits evidence of mild microangiopathic hemolysis, likely related to severe hypertension. Laboratory results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and schistocytes on smear. The patient's creatinine levels suggest an acute-on-chronic renal failure, and renal ultrasound revealed small atrophic kidneys. A renal biopsy is planned to confirm the diagnosis. Additional tests, including ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies, hepatitis B/C serologies, C3 and C4 levels, DS DNA, and lupus anticoagulant, are pending to evaluate for systemic vasculitis. The patient's chest CT is also pending to further investigate the etiology of respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, anemia, hypertension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated successfully and is currently on nasal cannula with PSV/SBT ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 131/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's recent labs show elevated creatinine levels and low hemoglobin. The patient's fluid balance is negative at -1,668 mL, indicating fluid loss. The patient's arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.46, indicating alkalosis. The patient has received medication for renal protection and is scheduled for a renal biopsy today. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin are not assessed, and neurologic examination is also not performed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to renal failure - The patient's elevated creatinine levels and fluid loss indicate ongoing kidney dysfunction.
2. Anemia - The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia, which may require further investigation and treatment.
3. Hypertension - The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and antihypertensive medications may be necessary to manage it.
4. Respiratory failure - Although the patient is extubated and on nasal cann"

   Assessment and Plan
   26 yo M with no PMH admitted with severe acute renal failure, volume
   overload and hemolysis
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unclear etiology at this point in time. Initial
   concern for HUS/TMA however on further eval, his worsening sx of nausea
   fatigue may be related worsening uremia. Renal ultrasound demonstrated
   small kidneys/echogenic, pointing to more chronic process. Post HD yest
   as pt presented with acidosis, electrolyte derangements, overload and
   uremia.
   - Continue HD today
   -will need renal bx
   -anca, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-GBM, -hepatitis B/C serologies,C 3, C4 levels, DS DNA,
   lupus anticoag pending
   - appreciate heme/renal recs
   # Respiratory Failure: patient is clearly volume overloaded likely
   secondary to acute renal failure. No clear evidence of pulmonary
   hemorrhage. CXR and oxygenation improved post HD. Plan to extubate this
   am.
   -          Continue HD for volume overload
   -          Vasculitic w/u as above
   .
   # Hypertensive Emergency: on nitro gtt, overnight for continued HTN.
   Most likely long-standing, goal BP 140-160
   - continue HD, consider addition of labetalol
   .
   # Hemolysis: Pt with evidence of microangiopathic changes with low
   hapto, elevated LDH. However T Bili nl indicating low level hemolysis.
   Few schistos on smear. [**Month (only) 8**] have microangiopathic changes related to
   severe HTN
   - Treat HTN as above
   - W/u vascultis as above
   - maintain active T&S
   - Trend hemolysis labs Q8
   - transfuse for Hct<21, plts<50 if bleeding
   # Elevated CE's: patient is very volume overloaded, so likely etiology
   is significant strain, however, can consider myocarditis in the setting
   of vasculitis, specifically Wegener's. EKG with nonspecific findings
   but no evidence of acute ischemia.
   - monitor on tele

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old male with severe acute renal failure, volume overload, and hemolysis. The etiology of the renal failure is unclear, but initial concerns included HUS/TMA. However, further evaluation suggests that worsening symptoms of nausea and fatigue may be related to worsening uremia. Renal ultrasound showed small kidneys/echogenicity, indicating a more chronic process. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) yesterday due to acidosis, electrolyte derangements, overload, and uremia. 

The patient also presented with respiratory failure, which was likely secondary to acute renal failure. Chest X-ray and oxygenation improved post HD. The plan is to continue HD for volume overload and vasculitic workup as mentioned above.

Additionally, the patient had a hypertensive emergency, for which nitroglycerin was administered overnight. The goal blood pressure is 140-160 mmHg. The patient will continue HD, and consideration will be given to adding labetalol.

Hemolysis was observed in the patient, with evidence of microangiopathic changes, low haptoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and few schistocytes on smear. Treatment for hypertension will be continued, and a vasculitis workup will be conducted. Active tracking of hemolysis labs every 8 hours is recommended, and transfusion for hematocrit <21 and platelets <50 if bleeding"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old male with a chief complaint of renal failure. The patient was admitted with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, uremia, and marked acute renal failure. The patient also has hypertension, anemia, and evidence of mild hemolysis and thrombocytopenia.

The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary renal syndrome, hypertensive emergency, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
- Anemia, other
- Hypertension, benign
- Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)

The patient has been treated with dialysis, renal biopsy, and more steroids based on the results of vasculitis workup labs and renal biopsy. The patient's condition has shown improvement in terms of renal function and respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening renal failure leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload, progression of anemia, uncontrolled hypertension, and further complications related to the underlying cause of the acute renal failure.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration in renal function, respiratory status, and cardiovascular stability. Adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary based on the patient's response to therapy and further diagnostic results"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 26-year-old male with no previous medical history who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, uremia, and marked acute renal failure. The patient presented with hypertension, anemia, and evidence of mild hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary-renal syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and hypertensive emergency. 

The patient's vital signs have stabilized, and respiratory failure has improved since dialysis and fluid removal. The patient's hemoglobin levels have remained stable without intervention. Hypertension is being managed with calcium channel blockers. 

Renal failure is being treated with hemodialysis (HD) and a renal biopsy (bx) has been performed. The patient's renal function is expected to improve with further treatment. 

Cardiac enzymes are elevated, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) are pending. 

The patient is on renal and cardiac medications, including regular insulin for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and peripheral IV line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. 

The patient's code status is full code"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old male with no previous medical history admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, uremia, and marked acute renal failure. The patient also has hypertension, anemia, and evidence of mild hemolysis and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure from pulmonary edema. Although the patient is currently stable on RA (respiratory assistance) and shows no signs of pulmonary edema or hemoptysis since dialysis and fluid restriction, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.

2. Renal failure: The patient has marked acute renal failure, which requires ongoing management. The patient has already undergone dialysis and renal biopsy, and more steroids may be necessary based on the results of the vasculitis workup and renal biopsy. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored to prevent further complications related to kidney dysfunction.

3. Hypertension: The patient has benign hypertension, which needs to be controlled with intravenous/po medications. The patient's blood pressure should be regularly monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to chronic kidney disease or another underlying cause. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and appropriate treatment, such as blood transf"
