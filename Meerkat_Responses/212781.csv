   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy, question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with submassive
   pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, holding coumadin for possible cardiac cath
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.

   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess

   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea
   - Imodium x 1 dose

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and recent admission for new cardiomyopathy, possible pneumonia, and diarrhea.
- The patient has been diagnosed with submassive pulmonary embolism, likely secondary to a previous embolism and temporary subtherapeutic dosing of Coumadin.
- The patient's cardiac function has decreased from an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-50% to 20-30% over the past few weeks.
- The patient's lung infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease or pneumonia.
- The patient's renal function has improved from a creatinine level of 1.4 to 1.3.
- The patient continues to experience diarrhea despite negative C. difficile tests and treatment with Flagyl.
- The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remain unstable, necessitating the holding of antihypertensive medications and beta-blockers.
- The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 34.8 and has received two units of blood during her stay.
- The patient is being treated for depression with Celexa.
- The patient is on ICU care, including prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and prior pulmonary embolism. She was admitted for new cardiomyopathy, question of pneumonia, and diarrhea. The patient has developed a submassive pulmonary embolism, likely due to a hypercoagulable state. She also has lung infiltrates suggesting chronic interstitial lung disease or pneumonia, which will be treated with antibiotics. The patient's cardiac function has worsened, with an ejection fraction decreasing from 30-50% to 20-30%. She has been diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs with improvement in dyspnea. There are fixed defects on echocardiogram suggesting ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient has chronic anemia with a hematocrit of 34.8 today. She has been given 2 units of blood at OSH, but no evidence of active bleed is present. This is near her baseline. The patient's renal function has improved, with creatinine decreasing from 1.4 to 1.3. She has a history of depression and is on celexa. The patient's medications have been adjusted due to concerns for hypotension, including holding lisinopril, metoprolol, and furosemide. Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium and repletion of electrolytes. Stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P, have"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation admitted to the ICU for new cardiomyopathy, possible pneumonia, diarrhea, and now with a submassive pulmonary embolism. The patient has been subtherapeutic on Coumadin at OSH and may have missed some doses. She is currently on heparin gtt sliding scale, with plans to titrate Coumadin to INR 2.5-3, and will need lifelong Coumadin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent pulmonary embolism due to subtherapeutic anticoagulation.
2. Abnormal chest X-ray suggesting interstitial lung disease.
3. Cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction of 20-30%.
4. Diarrhea for approximately 2 weeks, which has not improved despite treatment for C. difficile and flagyl.
5. Anemia with a hematocrit level of 34.8%.
6. Hypertension, currently on hold due to concern for hypotension.
7. Possible ischemic cardiomyopathy based on focal wall-motion abnormalities on echocardiogram.
8. Depression, currently being treated with celexa.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary arterial fibrosis, and previous pulmonary embolism.
- She was admitted to the ICU for new cardiomyopathy (likely ischemic), question of pneumonia, and diarrhea.
- The patient is now experiencing a submassive pulmonary embolism, with unclear etiology. No lower extremity deep vein thrombosis was found on Doppler, and there is a history of prior pulmonary embolism.
- She was temporarily subtherapeutic on Coumadin at the outside hospital.
- The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 103/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals crackles in the upper lungs, more pronounced on the left side.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated platelet count, and normal kidney function.
- The patient has been started on Coumadin 2.5mg PO daily.
- The assessment and plan include anticoagulation with heparin, consideration of higher INR goal for lifelong Coumadin versus lifelong Lovenox, and discussion of options with the family.
- The patient also has new cardiomyopathy with a decreased ejection fraction, fixed defects on echocardiogram, and improvement in dyspnea after diuresis.
- Other considerations include lung infiltrates, rhythm management, renal failure, diarrhea, and chronic anemia.
- The patient's medications have been adjusted, including holding certain medications due to hypotension and concerns about their effects on the heart and kidneys.
- The patient's code status and disposition are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary arterial fibrosis and previous pulmonary embolism, which increases the risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism. The submassive pulmonary embolism is currently being managed with anticoagulation therapy.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has developed new cardiomyopathy with a decreased ejection fraction. This condition can lead to heart failure symptoms and complications.
3. Pneumonia: Although the patient's recent CXR appears unchanged, there is a question of pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, pneumonia can progress and lead to severe respiratory distress.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea for about two weeks, which may indicate an underlying gastrointestinal issue. If not properly managed, this can result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Renal failure: The patient has a history of renal insufficiency, and her creatinine level is elevated. If not monitored and managed appropriately, renal failure can occur.
6. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, and her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low. If not treated, anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and some antihypertensive medications have been held due to concerns about hypotension. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled, it can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
8. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression, and if not appropriately managed, it can affect the patient's overall well-being and adherence to medical treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation admitted to the ICU for a new cardiomyopathy, possible pneumonia, diarrhea, and a subsequent diagnosis of a submassive pulmonary embolism. The patient has been temporarily subtherapeutic on Coumadin and is currently on heparin. There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or inferior vena cava filter placement. The patient's renal function has improved from a creatinine level of 1.4 to 1.3. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea for about two weeks, despite negative C. difficile tests, and is currently on a 10-day course of Flagyl. The patient also has a decreased ejection fraction of 20-30%, indicating some degree of heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a submassive pulmonary embolism, which could lead to further complications such as right ventricular strain, hypotension, or even hemodynamic instability if not properly managed.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a new-onset cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic in nature, leading to a decreased ejection fraction. This may result in heart failure symptoms and complications.
3. Diarrhea: Despite treatment for C. difficile and other interventions, the patient continues to experience diarrhea. This could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR today
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and prior pulmonary embolism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the emergency department with new cardiomyopathy, suspected infective endocarditis, question of pneumonia, and diarrhea. The patient has developed a submassive pulmonary embolism and requires anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of prior PE and is currently experiencing a submassive PE. There is a potential risk of further clot formation or extension, which may lead to hemodynamic instability and end-organ damage. Lysis therapy may be considered if the patient develops end-organ damage or hemodynamic instability.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 20-30%, indicating impaired cardiac function. This condition puts the patient at risk for congestive heart failure (CHF), arrhythmias, and increased susceptibility to infections.
3. Infective endocarditis: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible diagnosis of infective endocarditis. This infection can lead to septic emboli, systemic infection, and organ damage if left untreated.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea for approximately two weeks, despite negative tests for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and"
