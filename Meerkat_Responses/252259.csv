   to SVG-OM
   24 Hour Events:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8912**] is a 70 yo man with CAD s/p CABX [**2192**] (LIMA-LAD, SVT to
   RPDA and SVG to OM), diastolic CHF, PVD who was admitted to vascular
   surgery for L fem-[**Doctor Last Name 114**] bypass on [**5-4**] for thrombosed R popliteal
   aneurysm.  His operation was uncomplicated, but post-op at 3am he
   developed nausea & diaphoresis.  EKG showed lateral ST depressions &
   STE in III and aVR.  In this setting he developed hypoxia (SaO2 high
   80's on 100% NRB), & hypotension to the 80's for several hours.  First
   set of CE's were markedly positive with CK 1192 and trop 0.8.
   Cardiology was consulted who recommended urgent cardiac
   catheterization.
   .
   In the cath lab, he was found to have an acute occlusion of his SVG to
   OM1 graft.  Clot was suctioned from the graft and 2 bare metal stents
   were placed with good effect.  His BP improved with this intervention
   and he began making tood urine.  The rest of his coronaries showed
   native disease similar to prior cath.
   .
   On arrival to the CCU, vitals 97.1 126/64 73 26 87% on 4L.  Pt was
   given 40mg IV lasix and put on a non-rebreather with improvement of his
   sats to mid-upper-90's.  Pt was loaded with plavix and continued on
   integrelin drip.

   [**1-/2198**] ECHO
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is severe symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler
   and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
   diastolic dysfunction. The gradient increased with the Valsalva
   manuever. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
   relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic left
   ventricular systolic function. Mild diastolic dysfunction. Mild
   inducible outflow tract greadient. Moderately dilated aortic root. Mild
   aortic regurgitation.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diastolic congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with post-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and congestive heart failure. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of two bare metal stents to the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the omohyoid artery graft. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Recurrent NSTEMI or myocardial infarction.
2. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure.
3. Development of stent thrombosis or restenosis.
4. Complications related to peripheral vascular disease, such as peripheral artery disease or limb ischemia.
5. Progression of chronic kidney disease due to contrast-induced nephropathy or worsening renal function.
6. Hypertension or uncontrolled blood pressure.
7. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
8. Gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus or bowel ischemia.
9. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
10. Infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or surgical site infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac enzymes, renal function, and pulmonary status. Regular follow-up and adherence to prescribed medications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diastolic congestive heart failure, and severe peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted for femoral bypass surgery and presented with post-operative ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and congestive heart failure. The patient underwent catheterization and placement of two bare metal stents in the saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery graft. 

The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic diastolic/acute systolic congestive heart failure, new regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, poorly controlled hypercholesterolemia, and femoral bypass with peripheral vascular disease. 

Plan:
The patient's medical management includes completing integrillin post-cath, continuing aspirin, considering increasing Plavix to 150 mg daily if there is ongoing ischemia, uptitration of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for further afterload reduction due to mitral valve involvement, continuation of simvastatin with monitoring for adverse drug reactions, and considering cholestyramine as an alternative. 

For acute on chronic diastolic/acute systolic congestive heart failure, the patient will be diuresed to a goal of 500 mL negative, weaned off oxygen as tolerated, and given albuterol nebs as"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted for femoral-popliteal bypass surgery and presented with post-operative ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and CHF. 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of two bare metal stents to the saphenous vein graft (SVG)-omental graft. An echocardiogram showed new regional wall motion abnormality (WMA), mitral regurgitation (MR) murmur, and location of infarct concerning for papillary muscle involvement. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was estimated at 40-45%. 

The patient is currently on integrillin post-cath, aspirin (ASA), and simvastatin. The plan includes uptitration of beta-blockers (BB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) for further afterload reduction given the mitral valve involvement, and consideration of increasing clopidogrel to 150 mg daily if there is concern for ongoing ischemia.

The patient also has acute on chronic diastolic/acute systolic CHF, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with new regional dysfunction, negative three-lung oxygen requirement improvement, and borderline hypertension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He has allergies to certain medications such as Lipitor, Bactrim, and Atenolol. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 143/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. He is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for nausea shortly after arrival to the floor, with ST depressions slightly worse than previously seen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CK-MB, indicating myocardial injury. His electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient is currently receiving arterial and multi-lumen lines for monitoring and management. The plan includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The elevated troponin-T levels suggest myocardial injury, indicating a possible cardiac event such as a heart attack. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent any further cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory complications: The presence of crackles at the bases and wheezes during expiration may suggest underlying respiratory issues such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is essential to prevent any respiratory complications.
3. Renal complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and the use of medications like heparin sodium can potentially affect renal function. Monitoring kidney function through regular assessment of laboratory parameters like creatinine and electrolytes is crucial to prevent renal complications.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient's immunocompromised state due to critical illness increases the risk of infections. Prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP precautions are being taken to prevent infection-related complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage these potential complications promptly to ensure the best possible outcome."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2012. He presents with post-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was taken to the catheterization lab, where two bare metal stents were placed in the saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery graft. He is currently on integrelin therapy.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including NSTEMI/CAD, diastolic CHF, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). His lipid panel is elevated, and he will benefit from statin therapy.

Plan:
The patient is being managed for NSTEMI/CAD with aspirin, clopidogrel, increased metoprolol dosage, and statin therapy. Diuretics will be continued to manage diastolic CHF. The patient's hypertension will be managed with metoprolol and captopril. No rhythm abnormalities have been noted, so no specific treatment is required. The patient's PVD will be followed up with vascular recommendations. Statin therapy will be uptitrated, and the patient has been prescribed simvastatin 20 mg daily. The patient's CKD will be monitored with serial creatinine levels and urine output."

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
   by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild
   to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   infero-lateral akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-1-6**], there is
   new regional LV systolic dysfunction.

   I have reviewed the above progress note on [**2198-5-6**] at 11:17 AM by
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3458**] and have reviewed the history with the patient and his family,
   and was present during the physical examination noted above.  I concur
   with the assessment and treatment plan as outline above.   Mr.
   [**Known lastname 8912**] is a 70 year old man who developed a posterior STEMI
   following vascular surgery repair of his left popliteal aneurysm.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a thrombotic occlusion of the SVG
   to the OMB and two bare metal stent were placed.  He received aspirin,
   plavix and integrillin.  He developed recurrent nausea immediately
   after the procedure associated with persistent ST depressions, but this
   resolved.  He has multiple intolerances to statins and Zetia and has an
   LDL cholesterol = 197.  As a outpatient, we might consider the addition
   of cholestyramine as a bile acid sequestrant.  This afternoon, he
   developed [**3-13**] recurrent pain associated with some deepening of the ST
   segment depression.  This was controlled with IV NTG and he is now
   painfree.  We will cycle his enzymes and consider repeat
   catheterization for refractory pain or elevation of his cardiac
   enzymes.   Our plan is outlined above and involved implementation of IV
   heparin and NTG and continuation of his aspirin and clopidogrel.  This
   plan was communicated with the patient and all questions were
   addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) who presented with post-operative acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of two bare metal stents in the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the omohyoid artery graft. The patient's condition has been complicated by recurrent nausea, persistent ST depressions on EKG, hypotension, and worsening chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic/acute systolic CHF: The patient's current symptoms of hypotension, crackles at the lung bases, and mild pulmonary edema indicate worsening heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid status and diuresis is necessary to manage this complication.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure in the 70s requires careful monitoring and management. Cautious use of antihypertensive medications is advised due to borderline hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's poorly controlled lipid panel with an LDL cholesterol level of 197 indicates a need for further intervention. Considering the addition of cholestyramine as a bile acid sequestrant may be appropriate.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.5"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was admitted for femoral bypass surgery. The patient presented with post-operative posterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and had an acute occlusion of a saphenous vein graft, for which two bare-metal stents were placed.

The patient's condition has been improving, with cardiac markers trending down. However, he continues to experience ongoing chest pain associated with ST depression, indicating recurrent graft occlusion. The plan is to proceed with cardiac catheterization today, pretreatment with Mucomyst and sodium bicarbonate, and to wean off nitroglycerin as tolerated. The patient will continue on heparin, aspirin, and clopidogrel.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, with negative three liters of oxygen required but showing improvement. Diuretics will be uptitrated to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500mL. The patient will be weaned off oxygen as tolerated and will receive albuterol nebs as needed.

Additionally, the patient is suspected to have ICU delirium, possibly due to toxic encephalopathy. His urine output and chest X-ray will be checked, and he will"

   I have reviewed the above progress note on [**2198-5-7**] at 08:40 AM by
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and have reviewed the history with the patient and his family,
   and the physical examination noted above is consistent with my own
   today.  I concur with the assessment and treatment plan as outline
   above.   Mr. [**Known lastname 8912**] is a 70 year old man who developed a posterior
   STEMI following vascular surgery repair of his left popliteal
   aneurysm.  Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a thrombotic occlusion
   of the SVG to the OMB and two bare metal stent were placed.  He
   received aspirin, plavix and integrillin.  He developed recurrent
   nausea immediately after the procedure associated with persistent ST
   depressions, but this resolved.  Over the past 24 hours, he had one
   episode of pain but has been painfree today.  Our plan is outlined
   above and we will continue his continuation of his aspirin and
   clopidogrel.  This plan was communicated with the patient and his wife
   and all questions were addressed.  We will monitor his closely for any
   nocturnal disorientation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diastolic heart failure, and severe peripheral vascular disease. He presented with post-operative posterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute-on-chronic diastolic/acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current condition is improving, with ongoing chest pain associated with ST depressions but resolving. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 101/56 mmHg and heart rate of 68 bpm. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% through a nasal cannula.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including delirium, hypertension, rhythm disturbances, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypercholesterolemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and gastrointestinal issues.

Treatment plans include ongoing administration of heparin, nitroglycerin, and H2 blockers. The patient is also on statin therapy for hypercholesterolemia, with consideration for cholestyramine if the patient refuses. Diuretics are being used to manage CHF, and the plan is to wean off oxygen as tolerated. Monitoring for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is also important.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, recurrent myocardial inf"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with post-operative posterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature - 37.1°C, Heart rate - 68 bpm, Blood pressure - 101/56 mmHg, Respiratory rate - 26 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation - 97% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination: General appearance - appears well, HEENT - anicteric, MMM, CV - regular rate and rhythm, S1S2 II/VI holosystolic murmur at left sternal border, PULM - clear to auscultation, ABD - soft, normoactive bowel sounds, EXT - warm, dry, no edema, clean incisions without drainage.
- Labs: Hemoglobin - 11.3 g/dL, Hematocrit - 42.7%, White blood cell count - 14.7 thousand/mm3, Platelet count - 54 thousand/mm3, Creatinine - 1.7 mg/dL, Blood urea nitrogen - 26 mg/dL, Glucose - 134 mg/dL, Sodium - 136 mEq/L, Potassium - 4.0 mEq/L, Chloride - 99 mg/dL, Calcium - 8.6 mg/dL, Magnesium - 2.2 mg/dL, Phosphate - 2.4 mg/dL, Troponin T - 8.83 ng/mL.
- ECG: Sinus rhythm, ST-segment elevation in posterior leads.
- Imaging: Transthoracic echocardiography showed new regional wall motion abnormality inferolateral akinesis, left ventricular ejection fraction 40-45%.
- Other: The patient has a history of dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. He also has chronic kidney disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and there is evidence of acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. Close monitoring and appropriate diuretic therapy will be necessary to manage fluid balance and prevent pulmonary edema.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of CAD and recent STEMI, which increases the risk of arrhythmias. Telemetry monitoring should be continued to detect any abnormal heart rhythms promptly.
3. Delirium: The patient is showing signs of delirium, and further investigation is needed to rule out toxic encephalopathy. Regular assessment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He presented with post-operative posterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute-on-chronic heart failure. The patient was admitted for femoral bypass surgery and had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) performed. The patient is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic/acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) - The patient's CHF is improving, but there is a need for diuresis and weaning off oxygen as tolerated.
2. Hypertension (HTN) - The patient's blood pressure is borderline, so caution is needed with antihypertensive medications. The current regimen will be continued with holding parameters and converting captopril to lisinopril.
3. Rhythm disturbances - Telemetry monitoring is recommended.
4. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) - The patient had femoral bypass surgery and requires ongoing vascular follow-up.
5. Hypercholesterolemia - Statin therapy is indicated, and further discussion with the patient is needed.
6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) - The patient's baseline creatinine level needs to be monitored along with urine output.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) - The patient has a history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and was admitted for femoral bypass surgery. The patient experienced a postoperative posterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient also has acute on chronic diastolic and acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers (BB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), simvastatin, ranitidine, furosemide (Lasix), and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic/acute systolic CHF: The patient's heart failure may worsen, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's high cholesterol levels may increase the risk of further cardiovascular events.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. This may progress and require further management.
4. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The patient has a history of PVD and underwent femoral bypass surgery. There is a risk of graft complications or worsening peripheral circulation.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline high,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU for chest pain, delirium/confusion, coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia. He has been weaned off nitroglycerin and heparin, and his chest pain has remained absent. A chest X-ray showed possible findings but no white count or fever was observed, so clinical monitoring will continue. The patient's intake/output was recorded at 1800 -1400cc. Medications were uptitrated including imdur to 60mg PO BID and metoprolol from 12.5mg TID to 25mg TID. The patient experienced episodes of being out of breath while sitting in a chair but remained oriented when his wife was present. His hematocrit (Hct) trended down from 41.9 on admission to 32.6 and a blood type and cross were performed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient was weaned off nitroglycerin and heparin was discontinued due to no recurrent episodes of chest pain. The patient's intake and output are being closely monitored. The patient is experiencing delirium/confusion and has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin levels. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/66 to 151/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of further cardiac events, such as angina or myocardial infarction.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient's current symptoms of delirium/confusion could be due to various factors, including medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, infection, or withdrawal from substances.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was admitted for femoral bypass with post-operative findings of a posterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient has severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and was also found to have ongoing chest pain associated with recurrent graft occlusion despite cardiac markers trending down.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) for further afterload reduction given possible mitral valve involvement, simvastatin, and ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 61-95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 75-151 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 528 mL, output of 2330 mL, and a negative balance of -1802 mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 9.6-14.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin ranging from 33.8-42.7%, platelet count ranging from 150-540 thousand/mm3, creatinine ranging"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He presented with post-operative complications including a posterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute decompensated heart failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent graft occlusion: The patient's ongoing chest pain is associated with recurrent occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG)-OM1, despite cardiac markers trending down. This indicates a high risk for recurrent myocardial ischemia and potential adverse outcomes.
2. Mitral valve involvement: The patient's mitral valve involvement may contribute to his diastolic and systolic heart failure. This increases the risk of congestive heart failure exacerbation and related complications such as pulmonary edema and fluid overload.
3. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have ICU delirium, which can lead to increased fall risk, respiratory complications, and prolonged ICU stay. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are required.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's baseline creatinine level indicates CKD, which increases the risk of acute kidney injury during invasive procedures or medication use. Monitoring renal function and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
5. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's poorly controlled hypercholesterolemia requires further evaluation and management to reduce cardiovascular"

   I have reviewed the above progress note on [**2198-5-8**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
   have reviewed the history with the patient and his family, and the
   physical examination noted above is consistent with my own today.  I
   concur with the assessment and treatment plan as outline above.   Mr.
   [**Known lastname 8912**] is a 70 year old man who developed a posterior STEMI
   following vascular surgery repair of his left popliteal aneurysm.  A
   perioperative MI complicated the procedure and two bare metal stent
   were placed into an occluded SVG to the OMB.  Although he had slight
   pain after the pocedure, he has been painfree for the past 24 hours and
   is up in a chair without difficulty.  An increase in the frequency of
   his beta blocker has resulted in a short sinus pause and this will be
   managed with reducing the frequency of his beta blocker.  This plan was
   communicated with the patient and his wife and all questions were
   addressed.  According to his wife, he has not had any further nocturnal
   disorientation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He also had a posterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after vascular surgery repair of his left popliteal aneurysm. During the procedure, he experienced a perioperative myocardial infarction and two bare metal stents were placed in an occluded saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery. The patient has been pain-free for the past 24 hours and is able to sit up in a chair without difficulty. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, ranitidine, furosemide, and simvastatin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic/acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's history of CAD, CABG surgery, and STEMI increases the risk of developing CHF. Monitoring his fluid balance, oxygen requirements, and diuresis goals are important in managing this condition.

2. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has poorly controlled hypercholesterolemia. Statin therapy should be continued and consideration can be given to adding cholestyramine as an alternative to statin therapy.

3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's baseline"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and experienced a postoperative posterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute-on-chronic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition is stable, with controlled vital signs including heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). His physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for a II/VI murmur at the left lower sternal border and well-healed incisional sites without erythema or drainage.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct), as well as decreased platelet count (Plt) and creatinine (Cr). Troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ranitidine, furosemide, and Haldol.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Acute occlusion of saphenous vein graft (SVG) om1 with placement of two bare metal stents (BMS); trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed new regional wall motion abnormality (WMA)"
