","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient presented with asymptomatic oxygen desaturation from the nursing home. He has been treated with supplemental oxygen, nebulizers, and medication adjustments for his conditions. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has a low oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula. His blood work shows slightly elevated white blood cell count and potassium levels. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with diltiazem and warfarin. No evidence of significant heart failure is observed during the examination. The patient is currently receiving furosemide for diastolic CHF, lisinopril for HTN, and has a therapeutic INR for prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 90% on nasal cannula. This indicates a potential risk of hypoxia, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: Despite the absence of fever, cough, or leukocytosis, the persistent right base opacity on the chest X-ray may suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This needs to be"

The patient presented with asymptomatic oxygen desaturation from a nursing home, and hypoxia persists despite being asymptomatic. Possible causes include flash pulmonary edema secondary to AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR), COPD exacerbation, mucus plugging, pneumonia, or aspiration.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 75 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 118/47 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 90%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has been treated for AF with RVR. Nebulizers and prednisone have been started for COPD exacerbation, and antibiotics have been withheld pending sputum culture results.

The patient's physical examination reveals elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), poor air movement at the bases, faint expiratory wheezes, a well-healing ulcer on the left foot, and no rashes. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet count (Pl"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient remained asymptomatic for most of the day but experienced recurrent ventricular rate (RVR) episodes that were managed with diltiazem IV and oral doses. The patient's blood pressure remained stable during these episodes. The patient's medications were adjusted accordingly.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received heparin sodium for prophylaxis and diltiazem infusions.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted RVR episodes. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F) with a current temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate between 75 and 133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/47 to 155/80 mmHg, respiratory rate between 17 and 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is experiencing atrial flutter with a total input of 340 mL and output of 1,080 mL, resulting in a balance of -740 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG reading of ///45/. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not performed, skin not assessed, neurologic examination not assessed, and other assessments incomplete.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, hematocrit of 39.6%, platelet"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of COPD, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, all of which are exacerbated by atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic, hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 120/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently comfortable on 4 liters of oxygen and has shown improvement in her respiratory status overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying COPD, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, along with recent atrial fibrillation and respiratory volume restriction, may exacerbate pulmonary edema and respiratory decline.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be rate-controlled today. Dilute PO and IV as needed, and continue with coumadin, following INR levels.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, and it is important to keep it even to slightly negative. Recheck creatinine levels this afternoon.
4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation requires further management, including BIPAP for aid in ventilatory support, screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Atro"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with asymptomatic oxygen desaturation from a nursing home. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient's condition was complicated by flash pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/43 mmHg to 154/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent. The patient's rhythm is AFib with RVR.

The patient has received various treatments and interventions, including supplemental oxygen, nebulizer treatments as needed, prednisone taper, outpatient pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and monitoring of alpha-1 antitrypsin level. The patient's medication regimen includes diltiazem, warfarin, and lisinopril.

The patient also has low urine output, which is being addressed by encouraging oral intake and discontinuing Lasix. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level has decreased from 6500 to 4000, indicating improvement in heart failure symptoms. No"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old individual with a medical history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with asymptomatic oxygen desaturation from a nursing home. The current vital signs include a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 121/43 to 154/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and has an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 14cm. Physical examination reveals poor air movement at the lung bases, a well-healing ulcer on the left foot, and no significant edema. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as slightly subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's underlying chronic lung disease, exacerbated by flash pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, can lead to persistent or worsening hypoxia. Supplemental oxygen is being provided, and the goal is to maintain oxygen saturation between 88% and 92%.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR"

   Assessment and Plan
   89-year-old with diastolic CHF, HTN, recently diagnosed COPD presented
   with asymptomatic oxygen desaturation from nursing home.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Secondary to underlying chronic lung disease exacerbated by
   flash pulm edema in setting of Afib with RVR. Currently O2 sats stable
   on 3-4L via NC.
   - supplemental oxygen as needed; will wean down as tolerated (goal 88%
   -92%)
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs standing
   - prednisone taper
   - suggest outpatient PFTs
   - f/u alpha-1 antitrypsin level
   .
   # Afib with RVR: Rate controlled on diltiazem. INR slightly
   subtherapeutic.
   - Change from short acting to long acting diltiazem (total 360mg daily)
   - increase warfarin from three times per week to four times per week
   - monitor INR daily
   .
   # Low UOP: UOP increased overnight. Fluid balance slightly negative
   - encourage po intake
   - cont hold diuretics for now
   .
   # dCHF: Euvolemic on exam. Holding furosemide.
   .
   # HTN: BP stable
   - continue diltiazem and lisinopril
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: warfarin, H2 blocker
   # ACCESS: PIV

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with asymptomatic oxygen desaturation from a nursing home. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia secondary to underlying chronic lung disease exacerbated by flash pulmonary edema in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient is being supported with supplemental oxygen as needed and albuterol/atrovent nebs standing. 

The patient's other conditions include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being rate-controlled on diltiazem. The patient's INR is slightly subtherapeutic, and the plan is to change from short-acting to long-acting diltiazem (total 360mg daily) and increase warfarin from three times per week to four times per week with daily monitoring of INR.

The patient also has low urine output, but it has increased overnight. The fluid balance is slightly negative, and the plan is to encourage oral intake and continue to hold diuretics for now.

The patient's diastolic CHF is euvolemic on examination, and diuretics are being held.

The patient's blood pressure is stable, and the plan is to continue diltiazem and lisinopril.

The patient's electrolytes are replete"
