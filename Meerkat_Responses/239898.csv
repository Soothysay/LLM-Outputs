   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  On admission, pt
s respiratory status
   worsened with A. fib with RVR to 150s and further deteriorated after
   getting 1LNS.  CXR demonstrated ?pulmonary edema likely secondary to
   fluids and rapid ventricular rate.  ABG demonstrated respiratory
   alkalosis and hypoxia with PAO2 of 93 on NRB.  Also possible worsening
   interstitial disease secondary to malignancy progression. He was
   diuresed with lasix, rate controlled with dilt drip then transitioned
   to po digoxin given SBPs in the 80s, treated with BiPAP and now on high
   flow mask with 5L oxygen with improvement in his respiratory status
   this morning.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 852**] (oncologist) No ertonolib tx this admission for
   treatment of NSCLC.  IP saw pt  on [**1-28**] per Dr.[**Name (NI) 11944**] request for
   palliative throracentesis; not done as fluid amt too small to provide
   substantial benefit.
   -Given that pt is unlikely to require intubation, consider advancing
   diet today.
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Secondary to respiratory distress
   from known pulmonary processes.Low blood pressures make diltiazem
   boluses challenging, so initially placed on diltiazem drip then
   switched to po digoxin. Patient converted to NSR overnight on [**2180-1-28**].
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - continue to trend [**Hospital1 **], now improved to 131.
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU, could be called out today.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an EGFR mutation. He was admitted with a large right main bronchus pulmonary embolism (PE) and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) on admission. The patient's respiratory status worsened after receiving 1 liter of normal saline (1LNS), and a chest X-ray demonstrated possible pulmonary edema secondary to fluids and rapid ventricular rate. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia with a PaO2 of 93 on nasal high flow (NHF). There is also a possibility of worsening interstitial disease due to malignancy progression. 

The patient has been treated with diuretics (Lasix), rate-controlled with a diltiazem drip, followed by transitioning to oral digoxin due to low blood pressures in the 80s. The patient was also treated with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) and is currently on high-flow mask oxygen with an improvement in his respiratory status this morning. 

The patient's current medications include enoxaparin (Lovenox) for pulmonary embolism, digoxin for rate control, and biapap for respiratory support. The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, likely secondary to lung cancer (SIADH), and his imaging"

   -Follow on telemetry
   2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-Compromise secondary to PE
   and known lung cancer most prominently.  He still remains with
   substantial and significant oxygen requirement.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated-likely to evolve over the course of days.
   -Continue treatment for  PE
   -Effusion evalauted and not adequate volume for drainage but will have
   to be followed
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow
   -Aspiration precautions

   Imaging:
   CXR [**2180-1-30**]:
   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,
   particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid
   lung
   zones. The pattern is most consistent with a combination of alveolar
   and
   interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion that
   appears
   similarly to the prior study. The heart size is not changed
   substantially
   since the prior study and there is no PTX.
   IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease nonspecific - pneumonia, CHF or
   ARDS
   should be considered.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a
   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - trend serum Na
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. He was admitted with a large right main bronchus pulmonary embolism (PE) and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) on admission. The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, requiring a non-rebreather mask (NRB) for oxygenation. His ABG results are consistent with PE and tachypnea. The chest X-ray shows worsening opacity in the right upper lobe, suggesting pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a pulmonary infarct secondary to the large PE, possibly complicated by ARDS. There are no clinical signs of infection or fluid overload. Other possible causes include lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but the acuity argues against it. The patient is currently oxygenating well on NRB but requires close monitoring of respiratory status. Intubation may be necessary if respiratory status worsens significantly.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient should be attempted to be weaned off oxygen as tolerated, continue lovenox for PE, rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily, and monitor respiratory status. Intubation should be considered if respiratory status worsens significantly.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  On admission, pt
s respiratory status
   worsened with A. fib with RVR to 150s and further deteriorated after
   getting 1LNS.  CXR demonstrated ?pulmonary edema likely secondary to
   fluids and rapid ventricular rate.  ABG demonstrated respiratory
   alkalosis and hypoxia with PAO2 of 93 on NRB.  Also possible worsening
   interstitial disease secondary to malignancy progression. He was
   diuresed with lasix, rate controlled with dilt drip then transitioned
   to po digoxin given SBPs in the 80s, treated with BiPAP and now on high
   flow mask with 5L oxygen with improvement in his respiratory status
   this morning.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 852**] (oncologist) No ertonolib tx this admission for
   treatment of NSCLC.  IP saw pt  on [**1-28**] per Dr.[**Name (NI) 11944**] request for
   palliative throracentesis; not done as fluid amt too small to provide
   substantial benefit.
   -Given that pt is unlikely to require intubation, consider advancing
   diet today.
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Secondary to respiratory distress
   from known pulmonary processes.Low blood pressures make diltiazem
   boluses challenging, so initially placed on diltiazem drip then
   switched to po digoxin. Patient converted to NSR overnight on [**2180-1-28**].
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - continue to trend [**Hospital1 **], now improved to 131.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an EGFR mutation. He was admitted to the ICU with a large right main bronchus pulmonary embolism (PE) and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's respiratory status worsened after receiving 1 liter of normal saline, and a chest X-ray indicated possible pulmonary edema secondary to fluids and a rapid heart rate. An arterial blood gas analysis showed respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia. The patient was treated with lasix diuresis, rate control with diltiazem drip, transitioned to oral digoxin, and received non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP). Currently, the patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has shown improvement in respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further due to underlying lung cancer progression or worsening interstitial disease.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and potential complications such as stroke.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at high risk for recurrent PE due to malignancy. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued to prevent further thromboembolic events.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's"

   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a
   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - trend serum Na
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath. The patient was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. Over the course of their stay, several events occurred:

1. The patient was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress, tachycardia with frequent runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and fatigue.
2. The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) following intubation.
3. The patient was hypotensive and required neoplastic support.
4. A right subclavian arterial line was placed.
5. The patient was started on ARDSnet ventilation mode 400 x 20, 80%, PEEP 8, which was initiated at 12:00. However, they struggled with synchrony and tried different ventilation modes (pressure support ventilation (PSV), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)) without success. Ultimately, the patient was switched to airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) with high pressure of 30 cmH2O, low pressure of 8 cmH2O, high time of 2 seconds, and low time of 0.5 seconds. The last arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH of 7.15, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 60, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 73, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 22%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 200 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 106 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 19 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.5 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 91 mg/dL. Imaging reveals increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung, particularly in the upper lobe, as well as in the left lower and mid lung zones. There is also a left-sided pleural effusion.

The patient's medical history includes stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, for which erlotinib is contraindicated during this admission. The patient also has a large right main bronch"

   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,

   Patient is known to have large PE and is anticoagulated with lovenox.
   Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.
   CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary
   edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of infection or fluid overload,
   this most likely represents sequelae of his large PE, perhaps a
   pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also possible lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues against this.  Currently

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR mutation positive, admitted with large right pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) on admission and now has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and paralyzed on long-term ventilation (LTVV), requiring a FiO2 of 100%. The plan is to continue LTVV, increase PEEP, and decrease FiO2 as tolerated, with a maximum plateau pressure of 30.
2. ARDS hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is becoming progressively more hypercarbic. The plan is to titrate up respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV) as needed to reduce acidemia, and administer a fluid bolus with lactated Ringer's (LR).
3. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to the large PE and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation. Hypovolemic shock is also a possibility, but given the patient's large PE and anticoagulation with Lovenox, this is less likely. The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and there is worsening hypoxia requiring a non-rebreather mask (NRB). The ABG results are consistent with PE, tachypnea"

   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is

   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.

   Code status: Full code
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an EGFR mutation. He was admitted with a large right main bronchus pulmonary embolism (PE) and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's respiratory status worsened, leading to intubation and invasive ventilation. He required multiple vasopressors for hypotension and was placed on ARDSnet ventilation. Imaging shows worsening airspace disease in the right lung, consistent with pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress require close monitoring and oxygenation support. Intubation and invasive ventilation are already in place, and the possibility of weaning oxygen as tolerated should be considered. Continued monitoring of respiratory status is crucial, with plans for intubation if significant deterioration occurs.
2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely secondary to the PE. Monitoring of heart rate (HR) and continuing digoxin therapy are recommended. Rate control is important to prevent further complications.
3. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's high risk for PE due to malignancy, anticoagulation with lovenox should be continued. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications include:

1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has developed ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. This has led to hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is also experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, indicated by increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This may require adjustments in the ventilator settings to improve gas exchange.

3. Shock: The patient is likely in cardiogenic shock due to decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation and a previous pulmonary embolism. Other causes of cardiogenic shock should be considered as well. Fluid resuscitation and careful management of blood pressure are necessary.

4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a known large right pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin should be continued.

5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR, which can be managed with digoxin.

6. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): The patient has advanced NSCLC with metastasis. Oncology consultation should be sought to discuss treatment options and provide palliative care.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, and gas exchange, and adjust treatment accordingly. Regular"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of lung cancer and admitted with PE complicated
   by A-fib and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He has had substantial
   worsening across past 24 hours now to the point of persistent and dense
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe shock likely secondary to both
   compromise of right heart SV in the setting of ARDS as well as
   vasodilatory shock in the setting of ARDS.
   1)Respiratory Failure-have pursued alternative modes of ventilation but
   still have severe respiratory acidosis in the setting of some improved
   capacity to stabilize oxygenation on FIO2 of 1.0.  We are left,
   however, with persistent and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   This is attributable to significant dead space ventilation which has
   unfortunately progressed at this time.  This may be due to ineffective
   perfusion, overdistention of non-dependent lung units.  We have RR at a
   maximum at this time.  For his respiratory failure we will
   A)Hypoxemia
he will have PEEP titration today to determine optimal PEEP
   and hopefully allow some down titration of FIO2
   -Fent/Versed/Cisatra--at
 to allow passive support today
   -Will maintain FIO2 at 1.0
   -Will have to consider move to prone position if we are unable to
   maintain effective saturation with above measures.
   B)Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure-
   -This will have to be improved given severe acidemia
   -Will increase RR to 30 as possible
   -Will remove dead space from ventilatory circuit
   -Will have to increase tidal volume even though we will move beyond
   6cc/Kg given inability to maintain acceptable ventilation at this time
   -Will trial fluid bolus if are left with persistent and severe
   compromise of effective ventilation
   2)Shock-
   -Will need to evaluate CvO2 this morning to aid in confirmation of
   source of shock which at this point may well be a dominant finding of
   vasodilatory shock where what may have been a relative hypovolemic
   state at the onset.  In addition
we will need reasonable assessment of
   CVP at this time with a goal CVP of approximately 12 viewed as
   significant evidence against hypovolemic shock
   -Will check CvO2 to guide differential
   -Will send cultures for possible septic source if fever seen
   -Vasopressin 0.4-Levophed 0.45-Neo to continue
will look to correct pH
   as we can with ventilator and will utilize HCO3- as needed for blood
   pressure response
   -Will check ECG for possible myocardial ischemia
   -Do not see evidence of recurrent PE but is certainly of concern
   3) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Rate control as needed
   -SR for now
   4) PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   -On Lovenox

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of lung cancer who was admitted with a pulmonary embolism (PE). He has developed atrial fibrillation and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has worsened over the past 24 hours, leading to persistent and dense hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe shock. He is currently on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheter, and various pressors to support his blood pressure. The patient's respiratory failure is due to severe acidosis and hypercarbic respiratory failure caused by dead space ventilation. The plan includes optimizing PEEP to improve oxygenation, increasing the respiratory rate to improve ventilation, considering a prone position, and evaluating for other causes of shock such as vasodilatory shock or septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress to complete respiratory failure if effective ventilation cannot be maintained.
2. Shock: The patient's severe shock may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue to cause hemodynamic instability and increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's acute pulmonary embolism may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially recurrent embolic events.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to malignancy and prolonged ICU stay may increase"

   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to
   the recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.
   Known pulmonary metastases are partially obscured by the acute

   INDICATION: Respiratory failure.
   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear
   appreciably changed in the short interval between the two studies.
   Small right pleural effusion also appears similar.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and now
   with ARDS, on vent with shock requiring maximal pressors.
   1. Shock.  Cause of shock likely multifactorial.  Partly cardiogenic,
   [**12-21**] PE and now with with decreased pre load from positive pressure
   ventilation.  Also intermittently in atrial fibrillation with rates as
   high as 130, possibly contributing to poor output and shock. in Less
   likely hypovolemic, but given +9L yesterday.  Spiking fevers, likely
   septic component, blood cultures urine cultures sent, startedd on broac
   spectrum antibiotics.
   - mixed venous sat, if low
   - bolus LR prn
   - target MAP 65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone IV 50mg
   - continue vanc/cefepime, add levofloxacin
   1.  ARDS
 hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Patient now intubated and
   paralyzed on LTVV, requiring FiO2 of 100%.
   - continue LTTV, increase PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tolerated, maxiumum
   plateau pressure of 30.
   - permissive hypercapnia
   2.  ARDS
 hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient becoming
   progressively more hypercarbic.
   - titrate up RR, TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
   - fluid bolus with LR
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue lovenox
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   Several episodes of SVT and afib with RVR yesterday, in the setting of
   severe respiratory distress
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   6. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.

","The patient's medical history includes stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutation positive, pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and paralyzed on life support ventilation, requiring supplemental oxygen of 100%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which may be multifactorial including cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and septic components. Immediate management includes maintaining mixed venous saturation, bolusing with lactated Ringer's solution as needed, targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65, weaning pressors as tolerated, and administering stress dose steroids.
2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure. Continuing lung-protective ventilation strategies such as low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV), increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and decreasing fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) as tolerated is recommended. Permissive hypercapnia may be considered.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is becoming progressively more hypercarbic. Adjusting the respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV) accordingly to reduce acidemia is advised. Fluid boluses with lactated Ringer's solution and consideration of intravenous bicarbonate may be necessary if"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an EGFR mutation. He was admitted with a large right pulmonary embolism and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on admission. The patient experienced a dramatic clinical deterioration overnight, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intubation, mechanical ventilation, and shock requiring maximal vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ARDS hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient requires continued lung-protective ventilation strategies to minimize further lung injury.
2. ARDS hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is becoming progressively more hypercarbic, so adjustments to the respiratory rate and tidal volume should be made to reduce acidemia.
3. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation. Other potential causes include hypovolemia and septic shock. Cultures will be obtained regardless, given the patient's critical status.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient will continue to receive low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) to prevent further clot formation.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is currently in sinus tachycardia but has had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Digoxin will be continued at"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with stage IV lung cancer complicated by PE and now with
   severe ARDS and shock.  He has had ongoing efforts aimed at working for
   stabilization of his capacity to maintain adequate oxygenation and
   ventilation with ABG improved to this morning
   1)Respiratory Failure-This is a ARDS in the setting of existing PE and
   metastatic lung cancer which has shown some significant improvement in
   oxygenation and ventilation
   -Cistatracurium/Versed/Fentanyl
   -Wean FIO2 this morning
   -Continue Low Vt ventilation
will decrease to Vt=420 and keep RR at
   current levels
   -Maintain PEEP at current levels
   -Will discontinue paralytic agents at this time
   2)SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
He has substantial increase
   in volume support to 10 liters positive today and has had antibiotics
   started for vasodilatory state with high CvO2.  This morning he likely
   maintains a significant mixed picture with preload established as
   adequate but likely has a mixed picture of cardiogenic source and
   peristent vasodilatory state.
   -Levophed/Neo/Vasopressin
   -Vanco/Cefepime for possible infectious source
   -Will check CvO2 this morning
if it remains decreased
will move to
   inotrope for support
with cardiogenic source will have to consider
   possible recurrent insult with PE, Atrial Fibillation, myocardial
   stunning, myocardial supression in sepsis possible
   -If increased CvO2
will have to evaluate for alternative sources for
   persistent sepsis and do have concern for possible adrenal
   insufficiency and if increased or equivocal will move to test random
   cortisol and provide steroid replacment
   3) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Continue to monitor
will pursue cardioversion if needed for persistent
   hypotension and possible rate control
   4) PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE-
   -Continue at current levels for Heparin and follow PTT
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG-
   -Follow up per oncology who has been engaged in discussion throughout

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, who is currently experiencing severe ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and shock. He has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and metastatic lung cancer. The patient has been receiving respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and medications such as cisatracurium, versed, and fentanyl. His oxygenation and ventilation have shown some improvement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 59/47 mmHg to 83/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. He is currently in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine level, low total CO2 level, high glucose level, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Imaging shows good positioning of the endotracheal tube, improved aeration of the upper lobes bilaterally, and no signs of infection or other abnormalities.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (ARDS), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), pulmonary embolism (PE), and stage IV lung cancer. The plan includes continuing low Vt ventilation, weaning FiO2, maintaining PEEP,"

   have
   somewhat decreased, especially in the upper zones. These are
   superimposed
   upon known pulmonary metastases.

   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities
   superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear appreciably
   changed
   in the short interval between the two studies. Small right pleural
   effusion
   also appears similar.
   CXR [**1-31**] #1:
   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the
   gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to the
   recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and with
   ARDS, on ventilator with shock requiring maximum dose of 3 pressors.
   .
   1. Shock
 Now on maximal dose phenylephrine, norepinephrine and
   vasopressin, with MAPs in the 50s overnight.  Cause of shock is likely
   multifactorial.  Initially thought to be cardiogenic secondary to PE
   and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, with an
   element of hypovolemia, but he has not responded to aggressive fluid
   resuscitation, and his venous O2sat was 78% yesterday making other
   etiologies more likely.  As he has been spiking fevers, we are treating
   him for sepsis.  We started vanc/cefepime as empiric treatment for a
   pulmonary source.
   - recheck venous O2 sat, if low consider starting ionotropes
   (dobutamine), if not support BP with fluid vs additional pressors (epi
   vs. dopamine)
   - target MAP 60
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - start levofloxacin
   - sputum culture, blood cultures, u/a, urine cultures.
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6)
   - check LFTs, amylase lipase to look for further sings of shock (shock
   liver), possible causes (pancreatitis)
   2.  ARDS
 hypoxemia.  Patient now intubated and paralyzed on vent, on
   FiO2 of 100%, oxygenation improving
   - wean FiO2, repeat ABGs with vent changes
   3.  ARDS
 hypercarbia.  Also improved with high RR, Tv 450.
   - titrate down Tv, goal is ARDSnet LTTV
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue heparin gtt
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, alternating b/w sinus tach
   and afib with rates 100-120.  Unclear how much afib is contribution to
   poor CO and shock.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor dig level
   - consider cardioversion and amio load if HR increases
   - monitor HR.
   6. Acute Renal Failure.  Currently anuric, Cr up to 2.6, grossly fluid
   overloaded.  Likely [**12-21**] shock, systemic process.  If aggressive care is
   continued and he continues to be anuric, he will require hemodialysis.
   .
   7. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.
   - morphine for pain control
   8. Goals of care
 Respiratory status improving modestly, hemodynamic
   status deteriorating. Given persistent hypotension, likelihood of a
   return to baseline neurological status is low.  APACHE II score
   predicts inpatient mortality of > 87%.  Given family discussion
   yesterday. consider making patient [**Month/Day (2) 115**] and withdrawing care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an EGFR mutation positive status. He was admitted with a large right pulmonary embolism (PE) and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) on admission. He also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing multifactorial shock, which is not responding to aggressive fluid resuscitation. The cause of shock may be cardiogenic secondary to PE and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, along with an element of hypovolemia. Treatment includes maximizing vasopressor support, considering ionotropes if venous O2 saturation is low, and targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.
2. ARDS: The patient has hypoxemia and is intubated on a ventilator with FiO2 of 100%. Oxygenation is improving, and weaning of FiO2 and titration of tidal volume (TV) should be considered. IV bicarb may be considered if hypercarbia continues to worsen.
3. ARDS: The patient also has hypercarbia, which is being addressed by adjusting RR and TV.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient should continue on heparin gtt for the management of PE.

   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.

   8. Goals of care
 Respiratory status improving modestly, hemodynamic
   status deteriorating. Given persistent hypotension, likelihood of a
   return to baseline neurological status is low.  APACHE II score
   predicts inpatient mortality of > 87%.  Given family discussion
   yesterday, consider making patient [**Month/Day (2) 115**] and withdrawing care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an EGFR mutation. He was admitted with a large right pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and required maximum doses of three vasopressors for shock. He has been febrile, and his venous oxygen saturation was low yesterday. The patient has not responded to aggressive fluid resuscitation, indicating other causes for shock. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically for suspected sepsis.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is on maximal doses of phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin due to unresponsiveness to fluid resuscitation. The cause of shock is likely multifactorial, including cardiogenic secondary to PE, decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, hypovolemia, and sepsis. The target mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 60, and the patient should be rechecked for venous O2 saturation. If low, ionotropes (dobutamine) may be considered, along with additional pressors (epinephrine or dopamine). Stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6) have been started, and LFTs and amylase/lipase should be checked for further signs of shock (shock liver) and possible causes (pancreatitis).

2. ARDS: The patient is intubated and paralyzed on a ventilator with FiO2 of 100%. Oxygenation is improving, and weaning of FiO2, repeat ABGs with vent changes should be considered. Titration of TV to ARDSnet LTTV and consideration of IV bicarb if hypercarbia persists are also necessary.

3. ARDS: The patient has hypercarbia, which is improving with high RR and TV of 450. TV should be titrated down to ARDSnet LTTV, and IV bicarb may be considered if hypercarbia worsens.

4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a large right PE, and heparin gtt should be continued.

5. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient is on digoxin, alternating between sinus tachycardia and AFib with rates of 100-120. The contribution of AFib to poor cardiac output and shock is unclear. Monitoring of digoxin levels, cardioversion, and amiodarone loading may be considered if the heart rate increases.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is anuric with a creatinine level of 2.6, indicating acute renal failure. This is likely due to [**12-21**] shock and systemic"
