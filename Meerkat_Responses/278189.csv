   Assessment and Plan
   56 M with no PMH, Jehova's witness p/w weakness, bradycardia,
   hyperglycemia, STEMI now s/p stenting of posterorlateral RCA.
   .
   ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - Patient with significant
   right-sided infarction.  Elevated troponin/CK-MB and history suggest
   significant duration of ischemia and low chance of myocardial
   recovery.  Patient is s/p RCA stenting.
   - Medical management with ASA, statin, plavix, integralin
   - Daily EKGs
   - Follow CE to peak
   - Will start captopril once Cr improving.  No beta-blocker while
   bradycardic.
   .
   BRADYCARDIA - Likely seconday to ichemia of conduction system.  Patient
   appears to have isorhythmic dissociation.  Pacer wires placed in cath
   lab.
   - Will pace for hypotensive bradycardia but would prefer to have native
   rhythm if blood pressure tolerates.
   - No beta-blocker
   .
   PUMP - Will need careful monitoring of volume status as severly
   dehydrated from hyperglycemia and likely poor cardiac output secondary
   to right-sided MI.
   - Gental hydration post-cath.
   - Monitor for signs of volume overload
   - Echo on [**12-29**]
   .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA - Hyperglycemia may be refractory to MI, but likely
   represents longstanding undiagnosed diabetes.  Pseudohyponatremia from
   hyperglycemia likely responsible for hyponatremia, but patient will
   need significant rehydration and carefull electrolyte monitoring.
   - Insulin gtt
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] consult once controlled
   .
   RENAL FAILURE - Suspect acute renal failure in setting of poor
   perfusion and hyperglycemic hypovolemia.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent diabetic
   nephropathy if more chronic.
   - Daily Cr.
   - Rehydration as tolerated
   - Will check urine protein & lytes tomorrow if not improved.
   .
   CLINICAL TRIAL - Patient is on ICE-T-TIMI-49 trial, a RCT of low dose
   IC tenecteplace during PCI for STEMIs.  He received tenecteplase or
   placebo.
   Patient needs ECK at noon and 2 PM, and CBC at 5PM and 11AM, as well as

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 56-year-old male with no prior medical history, who identifies as a Jehovah's Witness and presented with weakness, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and a ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).
- The patient underwent stenting of the posterolateral RCA and is currently receiving medical management with ASA, statin, Plavix, and integralin.
- The patient's labs indicate elevated troponin/CK-MB levels, suggesting significant ischemia and potentially low chance of myocardial recovery.
- The patient has been diagnosed with bradycardia, likely secondary to ischemia of the conduction system, and is being paced with pacer wires placed in the cath lab.
- The patient is also experiencing severe dehydration from hyperglycemia and poor cardiac output secondary to right-sided MI.
- Hyperglycemia may be refractory to MI or represent longstanding undiagnosed diabetes.
- There is suspicion of acute renal failure due to poor perfusion and hyperglycemic hypovolemia, possibly related to diabetic nephropathy if more chronic.
- The patient is enrolled in the ICE-T-TIMI-49 trial, a randomized controlled trial of low-dose IC tenecteplace during PCI for STEMI.
- The patient requires various lab tests and monitoring, including daily EKG"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with no significant past medical history, presenting with weakness, bradycardia, and hyperglycemia. He was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent stenting of the posterior wall RCA. The patient's rhythm progressed from complete heart block to 2nd-degree to 1st-degree AV block (conduction delay), and temporary pacemaker wires were inserted. His blood glucose levels were significantly elevated, suggesting longstanding undiagnosed diabetes, and he was started on NPH insulin with a sliding scale. The patient also showed signs of renal failure, which improved after treatment. He is participating in the ICE-T-TIMI-49 trial, a randomized controlled trial of low-dose IC tenecteplace during PCI for STEMI patients.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently below the normal range, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and potential hemodynamic instability. Continuous monitoring and appropriate intervention, such as the use of temporary pacemaker wires, are necessary to maintain an adequate heart rate.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are significantly elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. This can increase the risk of infections, poor wound healing, and other complications related to hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy and dietary management are essential to control blood sugar levels.

3. Renal Failure"

   - Daily EKGs
   - Will start captopril today.  No beta-blocker as bradycardic.
   .
   BRADYCARDIA - Likely seconday to ichemia of conduction system.  Patient
   appears to have isorhythmic dissociation.  Pacer wires placed in cath
   lab.  Rhythm progressed from CHB to 2nd-degree to 1st -degree
   (conduction delay).
   - D/C pacer leads today as no longer with a rhythm that would indicate
   need for PPM and improving HR.
   - D/C lidocaine
   - No beta-blocker
   .
   PUMP - Will need careful monitoring of volume status as severly
   dehydrated from hyperglycemia and likely poor cardiac output secondary
   to right-sided MI.
   - Gental hydration post-cath.
   - Monitor for signs of volume overload
   - Echo today
   .
   HYPERGLYCEMIA - Hyperglycemia likely represents longstanding
   undiagnosed diabetes.  HbA1c 11.9 indicative of chronic disease.  Off
   insulin gtt.  Based on gtt requirements of [**3-19**] U/hr (> 50 U/day) and 14
   unit sliding scale requirement in 12 hours off gtt.  Will uptitrate NPH
   to 17 U [**Hospital1 **] given elevated blood sugars.
   - Will need PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2207**]
   .
   RENAL FAILURE - Suspect acute renal failure in setting of poor
   perfusion and hyperglycemic hypovolemia.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent diabetic
   nephropathy if more chronic.  Improved today.
   - Daily Cr.
   - Outpatient urine protein.
   .
   CLINICAL TRIAL - Patient is on ICE-T-TIMI-49 trial, a RCT of low dose
   IC tenecteplace during PCI for STEMIs.  He received tenecteplase or
   placebo.  Patient had ECK at noon and 2 PM, and CBC at 5PM and 11AM, as

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with no past medical history who presented with weakness, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and STEMI. He underwent stenting of the posterior wall RCA and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of undiagnosed diabetes, as indicated by elevated HbA1c levels. His current conditions include bradycardia likely due to AV node ischemia, right-sided myocardial infarction with significant RCA involvement, hyperglycemia, and possible acute renal failure. The patient is participating in a clinical trial for low-dose IC tenecteplace during PCI for STEMI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely secondary to ischemia of the conduction system. It is important to monitor his heart rhythm and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Right-sided myocardial infarction: The patient has sustained a significant right-sided myocardial infarction, which may lead to complications such as right heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may be indicative of longstanding undiagnosed diabetes. Proper management of blood glucose levels is crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's presentation suggests possible acute renal failure due to poor perfusion and hyperglycemic hypovolemia. Regular monitoring of renal function is necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with no past medical history who presented with weakness, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and a STEMI. The patient underwent stenting of the posterolateral RCA and has been diagnosed with significant right-sided infarction. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely secondary to ischemia of the conduction system. Close monitoring of the heart rate and rhythm should be done. The patient has already had temporary pacing wires placed, and it was decided to discontinue them since the patient's rhythm improved and he is no longer bradycardic.
2. Pump failure: The patient is at risk for pump failure due to severe dehydration and poor cardiac output secondary to the right-sided MI. Gentle hydration post-catheterization should be continued, and the patient's volume status should be closely monitored for signs of volume overload.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may represent longstanding undiagnosed diabetes. The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored, and appropriate management with insulin should be initiated.
4. Renal failure: The patient may be at risk for acute renal failure due to poor perfusion and hyperglycemic hypovolemia. Daily creatinine levels should be monitored, and outpatient urine protein assessment should be considered.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with weakness, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and a STEMI. He underwent stenting of the posterior lateral RCA and experienced infarction likely of the AV node causing bradycardia. The patient also has significant right-sided infarction with elevated troponin/CK-MB and a history suggesting significant duration of ischemia and low chance of myocardial recovery.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely secondary to ischemia of the conduction system. It has progressed from complete heart block (CHB) to second-degree to first-degree (conduction delay). The patient had pacer wires placed in the cath lab, but they were discontinued as the rhythm improved and the heart rate increased.

2. Pump failure: The patient will need careful monitoring of volume status due to severe dehydration from hyperglycemia and likely poor cardiac output secondary to the right-sided MI. Gentle hydration post-cath is recommended, along with monitoring for signs of volume overload. An echo today is planned to assess cardiac function.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia likely represents longstanding undiagnosed diabetes. HbA1c of 11.9 is indicative of chronic disease. The patient was off insulin gtt, but will be uptitrated to NPH at [**Hospital1 **] given elevated blood sugars.

4. Renal failure: The patient had suspected acute renal failure in the setting of poor perfusion and hyperglycemic hypovolemia. Cr levels are improving, and outpatient urine protein is needed for further assessment.

5. Complications related to the clinical trial: The patient is participating in the ICE-T-TIMI-49 trial, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of low-dose IC tenecteplace during PCI for STEMIIs. He received tenecteplace or placebo, and various tests including ECK, CBC, and CK-MB are being monitored regularly.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

7. Bowel regimen: A colonic/senna regimen may be needed if there are issues with bowel movements.

8. Code status: The patient's code status is confirmed as full code.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

   hyperglycemia, STEMI now s/p stenting of posterorlateral RCA.
   Infarction likely of AV node causing bradycardia
   ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - Patient with significant
   right-sided infarction.  Elevated troponin/CK-MB and history suggest
   significant duration of ischemia and low chance of myocardial
   recovery.  CKs have peaked.  Patient is s/p RCA stenting.
   - Medical management with ASA, statin, plavix.  Now off integralin.
   - Daily EKGs
   - Will start captopril today.  No beta-blocker as bradycardic.
   BRADYCARDIA - Likely seconday to ichemia of conduction system.  Patient
   appears to have isorhythmic dissociation.  Pacer wires placed in cath
   lab.  Rhythm progressed from CHB to 2nd-degree to 1st -degree
   (conduction delay).
   - D/C pacer leads today as no longer with a rhythm that would indicate
   need for PPM and improving HR.
   - D/C lidocaine
   - No beta-blocker
   PUMP - Will need careful monitoring of volume status as severly
   dehydrated from hyperglycemia and likely poor cardiac output secondary
   to right-sided MI.
   - Gental hydration post-cath.
   - Monitor for signs of volume overload
   - Echo today
   HYPERGLYCEMIA - Hyperglycemia likely represents longstanding
   undiagnosed diabetes.  HbA1c 11.9 indicative of chronic disease.  Off
   insulin gtt.  Based on gtt requirements of [**3-19**] U/hr (> 50 U/day) and 14

   Assessment and Plan
   56 M with no PMH, Jehova's witness p/w weakness, bradycardia,
   hyperglycemia, STEMI now s/p stenting of posterorlateral RCA.
   Infarction likely of AV node causing bradycardia
   ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - Patient with significant
   right-sided infarction.  Elevated troponin/CK-MB and history suggest
   significant duration of ischemia and low chance of myocardial
   recovery.  CKs have peaked.  Patient is s/p RCA stenting.  1^st degree
   AV block.
   - Medical management with ASA, statin, plavix.  .
   - Cont Lisinopril
   BRADYCARDIA - Likely seconday to ichemia of conduction system.  Patient
   appears to have isorhythmic dissociation.  Pacer wires placed in cath
   lab.  Rhythm progressed from CHB to 2nd-degree to 1st -degree
   (conduction delay).
   - Beta-blocker added tomorrow
   PUMP - Will need careful monitoring of volume status as severly
   dehydrated from hyperglycemia and likely poor cardiac output secondary
   to right-sided MI.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA - Hyperglycemia likely represents longstanding
   undiagnosed diabetes.  HbA1c 11.9 indicative of chronic disease.  NPH
   17 U [**Hospital1 **] given elevated blood sugars.
   -          Will need PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 2207**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with weakness, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent stenting of the posterior-lateral right coronary artery (RCA). The infarction likely involved the AV node, causing bradycardia. The patient's CKs have peaked, and he has elevated troponin and CK-MB levels. He is currently on medical management with aspirin, statin, and Plavix. 

The patient developed bradycardia, which is believed to be secondary to ischemia of the conduction system. Isorhythmic dissociation was observed, and pacer wires were placed in the cath lab. The rhythm progressed from complete heart block (CHB) to second-degree to first-degree (conduction delay). A beta-blocker will be added tomorrow.

The patient's pump function needs careful monitoring due to severe dehydration from hyperglycemia and likely poor cardiac output secondary to the right-sided MI. Hyperglycemia is suspected to represent longstanding undiagnosed diabetes, as indicated by an HbA1c level of 11.9, which suggests chronic disease. NPH 17 U has been given due to elevated blood sugars.

Renal failure is improving, and it is suspected to be acute renal failure in the setting of poor perfusion and hyperglyc"
