   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4134**] is a 25yo W with no significant PMH who presented to the
   [**Hospital3 588**] ED with chief complaint of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion
   and was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and blood smear
   consistent with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for consideration of plasmaphoresis.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia
   consistent with TTP. Fibrinogen is normal so DIC does not seem to be
   occurring. The etiology of her TTP is unknown; infection, medications,
   and pregnancy are not supported by her history. Autoimmune (such as
   ADAMTS 13 inhibitor) and idiopathic are thus the most likely
   etiologies. Followed by heme fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4135**].
   - Check ADAMTS 13 prior to first plasmaphoresis.
   - Begin plasmaphoresis tonight and continue daily until platelets 150K
   and LDH normal.
   - Begin prednisone, 1mg/[**Last Name (un) **] once daily.
   - Continue to monitor her HCT.
   - Transfuse RBCs if HCT less than 21.
   - Continue to monitor temperature and for signs of infection.
   - Re-check HCG, despite low likelihood given heavy period.
   - Test HIV.
   - Coombs test.
   - Vasculitis labs.
   - ?Diarrhea- E017:h7 assay.
   - f/u DIC panel.
   # Dyspnea, tachycardia, and chest pain upon exertion
   Likely due to decreased 02 delivery to the heart due to acutely
   decreased hct. Alternatively, microangiopathic disease in the heart
   could be preventing adequate blood flow to the myocardium. Pulmonary
   embolism is unlikely given that the pain is not pleuritic and pt has no
   calf pain. Pt has no pain now, while at rest.
   -          Follow up EKG.
   -          Cycle cardiac enzymes.
   -          Chest x-ray now.
   -          Continue to refrain from exertion that causes pain until
   situation has stabilized.
   -          If pain recurs consider nitro, ASA, morphine, oxygen, and
   beta blocker.
   # L ear pain
   Not clear whether this is related to the microangiopathic hemolytic
   anemia.
   -          Ibuprofen and tylenol prn for pain.
   -          Monitor symptom as pt begins plasmaphoresis.
   # FEN
   K+ low at 3.4.
   -          Replete with 60u PO.

   Problem 2 of A/P should read:
   Anemia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia picture in the setting of
   thrombocytopenia is consistent with TTP.
   - Continue to monitor hct.
   - Transfuse if hct < 21.
   - Check coombs test.
   - See plan for problem 1, thrombocytopenia.
   Vasculitis lab to begin: [**Doctor First Name 1205**]. Consider C-ANCA, P-ANCA, RF if [**Doctor First Name 1205**] is
   positive.
   L ear pain:
   Will also find an otoscope in order to be able to evaluate TM. Consider
   ENT consult if there is evidence for pathology and persistent symptoms.
   For ICU care section:
   Pt is on ISS, which is important given that she is being started on
   high-dose prednisone.
   No heparin given thrombocytopenia.
   No need for stress ulcer prophylaxis, given that she is not
   hypotensive, intubated, markedly ill.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4134] is a 25-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who presented to the hospital with chief complaints of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion. She was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and blood smear consistent with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was transferred to this hospital for consideration of plasmaphoresis.

She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions. She has been started on plasmaphoresis, which will continue daily until her platelet count reaches 150K and her LDH levels are normal. She has also been started on prednisone.

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 118/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals warm skin with tiny erythematous petechiae on the lower extremities, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 11K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, elevated LDH level"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4134**] is a 25yo W with no significant PMH who presented to the
   [**Hospital3 588**] ED with chief complaint of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion
   and was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and blood smear
   consistent with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for consideration of plasmaphoresis.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia
   consistent with TTP. Fibrinogen is normal so DIC does not seem to be
   occurring. The etiology of her TTP is unknown; infection, medications,
   and pregnancy are not supported by her history. Autoimmune (such as
   ADAMTS 13 inhibitor) and idiopathic are thus the most likely
   etiologies. Followed by heme fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4135**].
   - Follow-up ADAMTS 13 prior to first plasmaphoresis.
   - Continue plasmaphoresis and continue daily until platelets 150K and
   LDH normal.
   - Continue prednisone, 1mg/[**Last Name (un) **] once daily.
   - Continue to monitor temperature and for signs of infection.
   - Re-check HCG, despite low likelihood given heavy period.
   - Test HIV.
   - [**Doctor First Name 1205**] normal so no need to pursue additional vasculitis labs unless
   additional rash or other musculoskeletal symptoms develop.
   - Follow-up E017:h7 assay.
   - DIC seems unlikely given normal fibrinogen. f/u fibrin degradation
   products.
   # Anemia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia picture (based on low haptoglobin,
   high LDH, smear results) in the setting of thrombocytopenia is
   consistent with TTP. Menorrhagia also likely contributed to anemia. CXR
   shows no sign of pulmonary hemorrhage.
   - Continue to monitor hct.
   - Transfuse if hct < 21.
   - Follow up coombs test today
   - See plan for problem 1, thrombocytopenia.
   # Dyspnea, tachycardia, and chest pain upon exertion
   Likely due to decreased 02 delivery to the heart due to acutely
   decreased hct. Alternatively, microangiopathic disease in the heart
   could be preventing adequate blood flow to the myocardium. Pulmonary
   embolism is unlikely given that the pain is not pleuritic and pt has no
   calf pain. Pt has no pain now, while at rest. CXR normal.
   -  EKG shows no sign of ischemia or other acute process.
   - Chest x-ray shows no sign of acute process.
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes.
   - Continue to refrain from exertion that causes pain until situation
   has stabilized.
   - If pain recurs consider nitro, ASA, morphine, oxygen, and beta
   blocker.
   # L ear pain
   Not clear whether this is related to the microangiopathic hemolytic
   anemia. Improved today.
   - Will also find an otoscope in order to be able to evaluate TM.
   Consider ENT consult if there is evidence for pathology and persistent
   symptoms.
   - Ibuprofen and tylenol prn for pain.
   - Continue to monitor symptom.
   # FEN
   - Continue to follow electrolytes and replete as needed.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who presented to the hospital with chief complaints of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion. She was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and a blood smear consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The patient was transferred to another hospital for consideration of plasmaphoresis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is significantly low, which can lead to bleeding or bruising easily.
2. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia: This condition can cause anemia and may lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain.
3. TTP (Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura): The patient's symptoms are consistent with TTP, which is a rare blood disorder characterized by blood clots forming in small blood vessels throughout the body. Complications of TTP can include organ damage, neurological symptoms, and even death if not treated promptly.
4. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk of developing infections due to her immunocompromised state from high-dose steroids and plasmaphoresis.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low, which can cause symptoms such as muscle cramps, tingling, and irregular heartbeat.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4134**] is a 25yo W with no significant PMH who presented to the
   [**Hospital3 588**] ED with chief complaint of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion
   and was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and blood smear
   consistent with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for consideration of plasmaphoresis.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia
   consistent with TTP. Fibrinogen is normal so DIC does not seem to be
   occurring. The etiology of her TTP is unknown; infection, medications,
   and pregnancy are not supported by her history. Autoimmune (such as
   ADAMTS 13 inhibitor) and idiopathic are thus the most likely
   etiologies. Followed by heme fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4135**].
   - Check ADAMTS 13 prior to first plasmaphoresis.
   - Begin plasmaphoresis tonight and continue daily until platelets 150K
   and LDH normal.
   - Begin prednisone, 1mg/[**Last Name (un) **] once daily.
   - Continue to monitor her HCT.
   - Transfuse RBCs if HCT less than 21.
   - Continue to monitor temperature and for signs of infection.
   - Re-check HCG, despite low likelihood given heavy period.
   - Test HIV.
   - Coombs test.
   - Vasculitis labs.
   - ?Diarrhea- E017:h7 assay.
   - f/u DIC panel.
   # Dyspnea, tachycardia, and chest pain upon exertion
   Likely due to decreased 02 delivery to the heart due to acutely
   decreased hct. Alternatively, microangiopathic disease in the heart
   could be preventing adequate blood flow to the myocardium. Pulmonary
   embolism is unlikely given that the pain is not pleuritic and pt has no
   calf pain. Pt has no pain now, while at rest.
   -          Follow up EKG.
   -          Cycle cardiac enzymes.
   -          Chest x-ray now.
   -          Continue to refrain from exertion that causes pain until
   situation has stabilized.
   -          If pain recurs consider nitro, ASA, morphine, oxygen, and
   beta blocker.
   # L ear pain
   Not clear whether this is related to the microangiopathic hemolytic
   anemia.
   -          Ibuprofen and tylenol prn for pain.
   -          Monitor symptom as pt begins plasmaphoresis.
   # FEN
   K+ low at 3.4.
   -          Replete with 60u PO.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4134**] is a 25yo W with no significant PMH who presented to the
   [**Hospital3 588**] ED with chief complaint of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion
   and was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and blood smear
   consistent with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for consideration of plasmaphoresis.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia
   consistent with TTP. Fibrinogen is normal so DIC does not seem to be
   occurring. The etiology of her TTP is unknown; infection, medications,
   and pregnancy are not supported by her history. Autoimmune (such as
   ADAMTS 13 inhibitor) and idiopathic are thus the most likely
   etiologies. Followed by heme fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4135**].
   - Follow-up ADAMTS 13 prior to first plasmaphoresis.
   - Continue plasmaphoresis and continue daily until platelets 150K and
   LDH normal.
   - Continue prednisone, 1mg/[**Last Name (un) **] once daily.
   - Continue to monitor temperature and for signs of infection.
   - Re-check HCG, despite low likelihood given heavy period.
   - Test HIV.
   - [**Doctor First Name 1205**] normal so no need to pursue additional vasculitis labs unless
   additional rash or other musculoskeletal symptoms develop.
   - Follow-up E017:h7 assay.
   - DIC seems unlikely given normal fibrinogen. f/u fibrin degradation
   products.
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures.
   - Tox screen to explore etiologies.
   # Anemia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia picture (based on low haptoglobin,
   high LDH, smear results) in the setting of thrombocytopenia is
   consistent with TTP. Menorrhagia also likely contributed to anemia. CXR
   shows no sign of pulmonary hemorrhage.
   - Guaiac stool.
   - Continue to monitor hct.
   - Transfuse if hct < 21.
   - Follow up coombs test today
   - See plan for problem 1, thrombocytopenia.
   # Bandemia
   [**Month (only) 60**] be due to hyperactive marrow response in the setting of
   thrombocytophenia and anemia. Other possibilities include marrow
   pathology or inaccurate measurement in the setting of an abnormal
   smear.
   -          Repeat blood smear with manual diff.
   -          Continue to monitor.
   -          Follow-up blood and urine cultures.
   # Dyspnea, tachycardia, and chest pain upon exertion
   Likely due to decreased 02 delivery to the heart due to acutely
   decreased hct. Alternatively, microangiopathic disease in the heart
   could be preventing adequate blood flow to the myocardium. Pulmonary
   embolism is unlikely given that the pain is not pleuritic and pt has no
   calf pain. Pt has no pain now, while at rest. CXR normal.
   -  EKG shows no sign of ischemia or other acute process.
   - Chest x-ray shows no sign of acute process.
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes.
   - Continue to refrain from exertion that causes pain until situation
   has stabilized.
   - If pain recurs consider nitro, ASA, morphine, oxygen, and beta
   blocker.
   # L ear pain
   Not clear whether this is related to the microangiopathic hemolytic
   anemia. Improved today.
   - Will also find an otoscope in order to be able to evaluate TM.
   Consider ENT consult if there is evidence for pathology and persistent
   symptoms.
   - Tylenol prn for pain.
   - Continue to monitor symptom.
   # FEN
   - Continue to follow electrolytes closely and replete as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 25-year-old woman with a chief complaint of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion. She presented to the hospital with marked thrombocytopenia and a blood smear consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The patient was transferred for consideration of plasmapheresis.

Medical Complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has severe thrombocytopenia, which is consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The cause of her TTP is unknown, but possible etiologies include autoimmune (such as ADAMTS 13 inhibitor) and idiopathic causes. The patient's platelet count needs to be monitored, and plasmapheresis should continue until the platelets are above 150,000 and LDH levels normalize. Prednisone should also be continued.

2. Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia: The patient's blood smear shows a picture consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. This is likely secondary to TTP. The patient's hemoglobin level should be monitored, and transfusion should be considered if it falls below 21. A coombs test should also be performed.

3. Bandemia: The patient has an increased percentage of bands on her blood smear. This could be due to a hyperactive marrow response in the setting of thrombocytopenia and an"

   HIV negative.
   Urine HCG negative
   [**Doctor First Name 1205**] negative
   Micro: Blood and urine cultures pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4134**] is a 25yo W with no significant PMH who presented to the
   [**Hospital3 588**] ED with chief complaint of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion
   and was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and blood smear
   consistent with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for consideration of plasmaphoresis.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia
   consistent with TTP. Fibrinogen is normal so DIC does not seem to be
   occurring. The etiology of her TTP is unknown; infection, medications,
   and pregnancy (neg confirmatory urine HCG) are not supported by her
   history. DIC seems unlikely given normal fibrinogen. HIV is negative.
   [**Doctor First Name 1205**] normal. Tox screen positive for benzos, but otherwise negative.
   Etiology thus seems idiopathic, likely in the background of an acquired
   ADAMTS 13 inhibitor.
   - Follow-up ADAMTS 13.
   - Continue plasmaphoresis and continue daily until platelets 150K and
   LDH normal.
   - Pre-treat with Tylenol, benadry, lorazepine, and meperidine prn prior
   to plasmaphoresis today.
   - Continue prednisone, 1mg/[**Last Name (un) **] once daily.
   - Continue to monitor temperature and for signs of infection.
   - E0157:h7 assay once stool is available.
   - Check fibrin degradation products.
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures.
   - Followed by heme fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4135**].
   # Anemia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia picture (based on low haptoglobin,
   high LDH, smear results) in the setting of thrombocytopenia is
   consistent with TTP. Menorrhagia also likely contributed to anemia. CXR
   shows no sign of pulmonary hemorrhage. Hematocrit down slightly to 22.7
   from 24.8 since yesterday. It
s reassuring that LDH is decreasing,
   suggesting that hemolysis is slowing.
   - Transfused 1 unit PRBCs given symptomatic nature of anemia.
   - Guaiac stool once available.
   - Continue to monitor hct.
   - Follow up coombs test today
   - See plan for problem 1, thrombocytopenia.
   # Menorrhagia: Due to thrombocytopenia, which is gradually improving.
   -          Continue to monitor.
   # Dyspnea, tachycardia, and chest pain upon exertion
   Likely due to decreased 02 delivery to the heart due to acutely
   decreased hct. Alternatively, microangiopathic disease in the heart
   could be preventing adequate blood flow to the myocardium. Pulmonary
   embolism is unlikely given that the pain is not pleuritic and pt has no
   calf pain. Pt has no pain now, while at rest. CXR normal. EKG shows no
   sign of ischemia or other acute process. Cardiac enzymes not elevated.
   - Continue to refrain from exertion that causes pain until situation
   has stabilized.
   - If pain recurs consider nitro, ASA, morphine, oxygen, and beta
   blocker.
   # Constipation: Has not had a bowel movement for the past 2 days, while
   being in the hospital.
   - Start colace.
   # Bandemia
   No bands seen on manual diff. Likely an inaccurate measurement in the
   setting of an abnormal smear.
   -          Follow-up blood and urine cultures.
   # L ear pain
   Concerning for an infection that could trigger TTP, however TM exam was
   unremarkable, pt has remained afebrile, and pain resolved today without
   treatment.
   - Tylenol prn for pain.
   # FEN
   - Continue to follow electrolytes closely and replete as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who presented to the emergency department with chief complaints of petechiae, dyspnea on exertion, and menorrhagia. She was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and a blood smear consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was transferred to another hospital for consideration of plasmapheresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has severe thrombocytopenia, which can lead to increased risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
2. Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA): The patient's blood smear is consistent with MAHA, which can cause anemia and further compromise oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): The patient's presentation is suggestive of TTP, a life-threatening condition characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic abnormalities, renal dysfunction, and fever. Immediate treatment with plasmapheresis and corticosteroids is necessary to prevent further complications and improve outcomes.
4. Infection: The patient has undergone multiple plasmapheresis sessions and has been exposed to medical interventions, which increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are essential.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Last Name 4134], a 25-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, presented to the [Hospital3 588] Emergency Department with chief complaints of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion. She was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and blood smear consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was transferred to [Hospital1] for consideration of plasmapheresis.

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes:
1. Thrombocytopenia: Severe thrombocytopenia consistent with TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). Fibrinogen is normal, so disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) does not seem to be occurring.
2. Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia: The patient has a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia picture based on low haptoglobin, high LDH, and smear results in the setting of thrombocytopenia, consistent with TTP. Menorrhagia also likely contributed to anemia.
3. Anemia: Hematocrit down slightly to 22.7 from 24.8 since yesterday, but LDH decreasing.
4. Bandemia: No bands seen on manual diff. Likely an inaccurate measurement in the setting of an abnormal smear.
5. Dyspnea, Tachycardia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4134**] is a 25yo W with no significant PMH who presented to the
   [**Hospital3 588**] ED with chief complaint of petechiae and dyspnea on exertion
   and was found to have marked thrombocytopenia and blood smear
   consistent with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. She was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for consideration of plasmaphoresis.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia
   consistent with TTP. Fibrinogen is normal so DIC does not seem to be
   occurring. The etiology of her TTP is unknown; infection, medications,
   and pregnancy (neg confirmatory urine HCG) are not supported by her
   history. DIC seems unlikely given normal fibrinogen. HIV is negative.
   [**Doctor First Name 1205**] normal. Tox screen positive for benzos, but otherwise negative.
   Etiology thus seems idiopathic, likely in the background of an acquired
   ADAMTS 13 inhibitor.
   - Follow-up ADAMTS 13.
   - Continue plasmaphoresis and continue daily until platelets 150K and
   LDH normal. Use benadryl and ice for pruritis.
   - Continue prednisone, 1mg/[**Last Name (un) **] once daily.
   - Continue to monitor temperature and for signs of infection.
   - Check E0157:h7 assay.
   - Check fibrin degradation products.
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures.
   - Followed by heme fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4135**].
   # Anemia
   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia picture (based on low haptoglobin,
   high LDH, smear results) in the setting of thrombocytopenia is
   consistent with TTP. Menorrhagia also likely contributed to anemia. CXR
   shows no sign of pulmonary hemorrhage. Hematocrit down slightly to 22.7
   from 24.8 since yesterday, likely due to menorrhagia, but LDH
   decreasing.
   - Guaiac stool.
   - Continue to monitor hct.
   - Transfuse if hct < 21.
   - Follow up coombs test today
   - See plan for problem 1, thrombocytopenia.
   # Menorrhagia
   -          Anything we can do?
   # Dyspnea, tachycardia, and chest pain upon exertion
   Likely due to decreased 02 delivery to the heart due to acutely
   decreased hct. Alternatively, microangiopathic disease in the heart
   could be preventing adequate blood flow to the myocardium. Pulmonary
   embolism is unlikely given that the pain is not pleuritic and pt has no
   calf pain. Pt has no pain now, while at rest. CXR normal. EKG shows no
   sign of ischemia or other acute process. Cardiac enzymes not elevated.
   - Continue to refrain from exertion that causes pain until situation
   has stabilized.
   - If pain recurs consider nitro, ASA, morphine, oxygen, and beta
   blocker.
   # Bandemia
   No bands seen on manual diff. Likely an inaccurate measurement in the
   setting of an abnormal smear.
   -          Follow-up blood and urine cultures.
   # L ear pain
   Concerning for an infection that could trigger TTP, however TM exam was
   unremarkable and pt has remained afebrile. Pain improved today.
   - Consider ENT consult.
   - Tylenol prn for pain.
   # FEN
   - Continue to follow electrolytes closely and replete as needed.
