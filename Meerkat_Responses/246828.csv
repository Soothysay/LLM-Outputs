   1. Hypoxia/ New diffuse L lung opacity: Pt without baseline O2
   requirement at home. Prior to current event involing tachycardia, she
   had already be intermittently desating to high 70s with a productive
   cough.  Mucus plugging high on differential as her sat seems to improve
   with coughing and chest PT. New diffuse lung opacity concerning for
   # mucus plugging  decreased ability to clear airways since y-stent
   placement
   -- bronchoscopy this morning by IP; if findings not suggestive, may
   pursue CTA
   -- no empiric anticoagulation for PE given recent surgery and bleeding
   also on differential
   -- serial CXR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent a radical left nephrectomy. She has known metastases to the skull, mediastinum, lungs, and hip. 

The patient developed tachycardia with a new diffuse opacity over the entire left lung field, indicating possible mucus plugging and decreased ability to clear airways since the y-stent placement. A bronchoscopy was performed to remove mucus plugs and re-expand the lung, which showed improvement in mental status, removal of mucus plugs, and re-expansion of the lung.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), a heart rate of 117 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 111/51 mmHg to 153/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on face tent.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as increased troponin T level. The imaging reveals marked improvement in aeration of the left lung, bulky lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum and both hila, asymmetrical perihilar haziness on the left possibly related to re-expansion edema, small left apical pneumothorax, and a small layering left pleural effusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent a radical left nephrectomy three days ago. She was found to have a collapsed left lung due to mucus plugging, which improved after bronchoscopy and mucolytics. She also has an elevated INR, likely due to vitamin K deficiency, and responded partially to vitamin K supplementation. Her tachycardia is attributed to volume depletion. She received two units of blood during surgery and her hemoglobin levels are stable at 30%. The plan is to start chemotherapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. She has a right hip metastasis and is advised to avoid weight-bearing activities. She is currently in the ICU receiving supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia/Mucus Plugging: The patient's improvement with bronch and mucolytics suggests that she may still be at risk for recurrent mucus plugging and hypoxemia.
2. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR could increase the risk of bleeding, especially if she undergoes procedures or has invasive interventions.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia may persist or worsen if she becomes dehydrated or has ongoing volume depletion.
4. Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient's underlying cancer can progress and lead to further complications such as additional metastases or organ dysfunction.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 612**] has responded to 2 L NS on account of recent tachycardia.
   She continues to bring up thick secretions with nebs. chest PT and
   hydration. She denies severe pain.
   Exam notable for Tm 100.1 BP  107/48 HR of 100 RR of 20 with sats of
   97% on face tent O2 . she has decreased air entry at left base with
   dullness/ egophony. She has scattered exp wheezing in right lung.
    Labs notable for WBC 8.3 K, HCT 26.7 , K+ 4.2, Cr  0.5 ,  CXR with
   decreasing pleural effusion on left ( still moderate)
   Agree with plan to provide aggressive bronchopulmonary assistance with
   secretions. [**Month (only) 51**] need antibiotics if sputum GS shows increasing polys or
   clincial features of infection . She will need to get OOB to chair/
   possibly ambulate with help.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent a left nephrectomy three days ago. She has been experiencing tachycardia and developed a diffuse opacity over her entire left lung field due to mucus plugging. The patient's hypoxia improved significantly with bronchial and mucolytic treatments. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a face tent. The patient's chest X-ray shows a complete left lower lobe collapse, slightly increased left pleural effusion, and a very tiny left apical pneumothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's baseline oxygen requirement at home has increased due to mucus plugging, leading to hypoxemia. Daily chest physiotherapy, nebulized treatments, and sputum culture are recommended. 
2. Elevated INR: The patient's INR levels are elevated, indicating a potential bleeding risk. Vitamin K supplementation has been given, and further monitoring of INR levels is necessary.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be due to volume depletion. She received a bolus of normal saline, which partially responded.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who underwent a radical left nephrectomy three days ago.
- She developed tachycardia and had new diffuse opacity over her entire left lung field due to mucus plugging, which improved with bronch and mucolytics.
- She is currently on levalbuterol, ipratropium, and acetylcysteine nebs, and will be converted to standing.
- Her INR was elevated, but responded partially to vitamin K administration and is now down to 1.4.
- She has tachycardia, which is likely due to volume depletion and has improved after receiving a 2L NS bolus.
- The patient had intraoperative blood losses and received two units of blood, resulting in a stable Hct of 30.
- She has metastatic renal cell carcinoma with known metastases to the skull, mediastinum, lungs, and hip.
- She has been ambulating with a walker until this admission.
- Her right hip metastasis was previously described as non-weight bearing, but she is now able to ambulate with a walker.
- She has a PICC line in place for medication administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient initially had hypoxemia due to mucus plugging in the left lung field. However, it improved with bronch and mucolytics"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. She underwent a radical left nephrectomy and had a chest tube placement, resulting in a pneumothorax. The patient developed tachycardia and a diffuse opacity over the entire left lung field due to mucus plugging. This improved dramatically with bronch and mucolytics. The patient's hypoxia/mucus plugging improved after using bronch and mucolytics, and a repeat chest X-ray showed re-aeration of the left lung field.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypoxia/Mucus Plugging: The patient's lack of baseline oxygen requirement at home, along with the improvement of her hypoxia/mucus plugging after using bronch and mucolytics, suggests that this is the primary concern.
2. Elevated INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, which is unusual considering she does not appear to be markedly malnourished. The patient responded partially to 5mg of vitamin K and received another 10mg today. Her albumin level is slightly low at 3.2 g/dL.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which may be related to volume depletion. She received a 2L normal saline bolus and her heart rate has improved.
