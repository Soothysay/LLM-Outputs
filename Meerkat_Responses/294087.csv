   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: unclear how accurate this is given his likely diffuse
   vascular disease
   - arterial line for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring although still
   unlikely getting true MAP as extensive vascular disease including in
   upper extremity.
   - will follow lactate level and get an Echo to get a better assessment
   of his BPs and cardiac output
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
   - holding BP meds
   2. Hypothermia: infectious workup as mentioned; not complaining of
   chills/fever currently; cont to monitor
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - given borderline BP and worsening renal function, will hold off on
   diuresis at this time; fluid management via HD
   - cont low-dose beta blocker
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA; cont vancomycin and empiric ceftazidime and
   follow up cultures
   - patient deciding on BKA vs second opinion
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   - resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   - low-dose beta blocker for rate control
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - d/w renal re prednisone taper
   - HD today. Renal aware.
   - Will follow up HD recs to see how much fluid he needs off
 if any.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension and hypothermia. 

Current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 80 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 81/50 mmHg to 88/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's arterial line was started, and an echocardiogram will be obtained to assess cardiac output. Blood cultures have been ordered, and blood pressure medications have been held.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies have not been mentioned in the progress note.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to extensive vascular disease, including in the upper extremity. An arterial line has been placed for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring, and a follow-up echo will be performed to assess blood pressures and cardiac output. Blood cultures will be checked for bacteremia/sepsis, and blood pressure medications"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic kidney disease stage V (CKD V), failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 81/50 to 88/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. He is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed. These include hypotension, hypothermia, hypoxia likely due to pulmonary edema, osteomyelitis, acute blood loss anemia, atrial fibrillation, CKD V with a failed renal transplant, and thrombocytopenia.

The assessment and plan for each issue are as follows:
1. Hypotension: An arterial line has been placed for accurate hemodynamic monitoring. Blood cultures have been obtained to assess for bacteremia/sepsis. Holding blood pressure medications is also planned.
2. Hypothermia: An infectious workup is ongoing. The patient"

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to diffuse vascular disease. An arterial line has been placed for accurate hemodynamic monitoring, and blood cultures have been obtained to assess for bacteremia/sepsis. Blood pressure medications have been withheld.
2. Hypothermia: An infectious workup is being performed"

- The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal transplant, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He also has congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, aortic stenosis (AS), and diastolic CHF.
- The patient was admitted with a left heel ulcer and developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). He also has upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was on warfarin, which has been discontinued.
- The patient is experiencing progressive thrombocytopenia, which is presumed to be due to Immuran (azathioprine), a medication used to prevent organ transplant rejection. The patient's platelet count is low, but he is not bleeding.
- The patient's peripheral pulses are weak or absent in both arms and legs, indicating possible severe peripheral arterial disease or complications related to his PVD.
- The patient has intermittent hypoxemia and requires supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.
- His vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 49/39 mmHg and mild hypothermia with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F). His heart rate is 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%.

   24 Hour Events:
   #. PTX on CXR yesterday. CT placed CT. Patient was initially better
   with BPs increased and HRs down. Then BPs started to trend down with
   Increasing HR. Patient received 2X 500Ns bolus and then was started on
   1L D5Ns at 75ml/hour to maintain pressures. Ultimately another CXR was
   obtained that showed no resolution of the PTX and the chest tube seemed
   to have fallen out slightly. When it was replaced the patient began to
   do better clinically with decreased HRs and increased BPs. Developed
   mucous plug at around 2am. SBPs dropped to 60s and Hr up to 150s with
   sats ~88% on 100% FiO2. ABG:7.31/38/47. Suctioned out large sputum plug
   and sats came up, BPs came up, and HRs went down to high 90s.
   #. She also converted into Afib with RVR (rate around 150). An EKG was
   done confirming this and showing ST depressions in V2. She was given
   5mg lopressor then 20mg IV diltiazem and rates came down into the 100s
   with BP 100/50.  All of her electrolytes were WNL at the time. She then
   developed HRs in the 150s. Given another 5mg lopressor which dropped
   her BPs to the 80s/40s and did not change her HR. Hct was down to 32
   from 42 in the am and lactate was elevated at 3.2 with  MvO2 of 77%.
   UOP was around 15-30mL/hr. Decided to give her 1unit pRBCs to try to
   increased O2 delivery.
   #. ID has been following and recommended meropenem instead of zosyn to
   treat pseudomonas in sputum as MIC was high for zosyn and lower for
   meropenem. the antibiotics were thus switched.
   #. Heme/onc suggested weaning steroids very slowly (Qweek) to ensure no
   AI. Will likely start weaning today.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: unclear how accurate this is given his likely diffuse
   vascular disease
   - arterial line for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring although still
   unlikely getting true MAP as extensive vascular disease including in
   upper extremity.
   - will follow lactate level and get an Echo to get a better assessment
   of his BPs and cardiac output
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
   - holding BP meds
   2. Hypothermia: infectious workup as mentioned; not complaining of
   chills/fever currently; cont to monitor
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - given borderline BP and worsening renal function, will hold off on
   diuresis at this time; fluid management via HD
   - cont low-dose beta blocker
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA; cont vancomycin and empiric ceftazidime and
   follow up cultures
   - patient deciding on BKA vs second opinion
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   - resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   - low-dose beta blocker for rate control
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - d/w renal re prednisone taper
   - HD today. Renal aware.
   - Will follow up HD recs to see how much fluid he needs off
 if any.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was admitted to the MICU for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to his extensive vascular disease. He has an arterial line for accurate hemodynamic monitoring, but it may not provide a true mean arterial pressure (MAP) due to his vascular disease. Further assessment is needed through lactate levels and an echocardiogram to evaluate his blood pressures and cardiac output. Blood cultures will also be followed to assess for bacteremia or sepsis. Holding blood pressure medications is recommended.

2. Hypothermia: An infectious workup should be conducted as mentioned. The patient is currently not complaining of chills or fever, so monitoring will continue.

3. Hypoxia: The patient likely has pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure. Diuretic therapy has been withheld due to the patient's borderline blood pressure and worsening renal function. Fluid management will be done through hemodialysis. A low-dose beta blocker will be continued.

4. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a wound swab"

   24 Hour Events:
   #. PTX on CXR yesterday. CT placed CT. Patient was initially better
   with BPs increased and HRs down. Then BPs started to trend down with
   Increasing HR. Patient received 2X 500Ns bolus and then was started on
   1L D5Ns at 75ml/hour to maintain pressures. Ultimately another CXR was
   obtained that showed no resolution of the PTX and the chest tube seemed
   to have fallen out slightly. When it was replaced the patient began to
   do better clinically with decreased HRs and increased BPs. Developed
   mucous plug at around 2am. SBPs dropped to 60s and Hr up to 150s with
   sats ~88% on 100% FiO2. ABG:7.31/38/47. Suctioned out large sputum plug
   and sats came up, BPs came up, and HRs went down to high 90s.
   #. She also converted into Afib with RVR (rate around 150). An EKG was
   done confirming this and showing ST depressions in V2. She was given
   5mg lopressor then 20mg IV diltiazem and rates came down into the 100s
   with BP 100/50.  All of her electrolytes were WNL at the time. She then
   developed HRs in the 150s. Given another 5mg lopressor which dropped
   her BPs to the 80s/40s and did not change her HR. Hct was down to 32
   from 42 in the am and lactate was elevated at 3.2 with  MvO2 of 77%.
   UOP was around 15-30mL/hr. Decided to give her 1unit pRBCs to try to
   increased O2 delivery.
   #. ID has been following and recommended meropenem instead of zosyn to
   treat pseudomonas in sputum as MIC was high for zosyn and lower for
   meropenem. the antibiotics were thus switched.
   #. Heme/onc suggested weaning steroids very slowly (Qweek) to ensure no
   AI. Will likely start weaning today.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to maintain blood pressure within normal ranges.
2. Hypothermia: Hypothermia can impair bodily functions, including cardiac function and metabolism. It is essential to address the underlying cause and provide appropriate warming measures.

   24 Hour Events:
   #. BPs on floor were at times in the 100s even without A -line so BPs
   in 60s-70s from A-line and correlating with cuff likely true readings.
   Pt was thus started on levophed and BPs improved however HR was in the
   140s. Levophed was slowly weaned after a fluid bolus of 500mL NS. HRs
   came down to 110s with MAPs at ~65.
   #. Family meeting: patient agrees to BKA. Vascular surgery is aware and
   will take him when medically stable.
   #. Got HD with 1unit pRBCs, midodrine, and albumin yesterday.  Hct to

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypothermia, hypoxia, osteomyelitis, acute blood loss anemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) V, and thrombocytopenia.

Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are inconsistent, possibly due to extensive vascular disease. An arterial line has been placed for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring. Lactate levels will be followed, and an echocardiogram (Echo) will be obtained to assess the patient's blood pressures and cardiac output. Blood cultures will be monitored for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis. Beta blocker medications will be continued.

Hypothermia: An infectious workup is ongoing. The patient is currently not complaining of chills or fever, so further evaluation is needed. Continuous monitoring of the patient's temperature is recommended.

Hypoxia: The patient likely has pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF. Diuretic therapy will be withheld due"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.9 from 3s). Likely getting better
   CO/perfusion with levophed.
   - TTE today to assess cardiac function. Suspect this is main cause of
   his hypotension given CXR results and over-all clinically fluid
   overloaded.
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
   - holding BP meds.
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.
   -CVVH may help to take off some fluid and then with lower pre-load may
   have a better CO and a better MAP
   2. Hypothermia: infectious workup as mentioned; not complaining of
   chills/fever currently; cont to monitor. No temps below 98 o/n.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA; cont vancomycin and empiric ceftazidime and
   follow up cultures
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   -          Has had tachycardia (afib with RVR) since starting levophed.
   Slightly responsive to fluid bolus and pRBCs O/N. As pressures better
   hesitate to d/c the levophed but may need a different pressor.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - d/w renal re prednisone taper
   - HD yesterday. Renal aware. [**Month (only) 51**] get CVVH today per HD recs as-fluid
   management via HD but did not take any fluid off yesterday in setting
   of hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] actually need some diuresis to increase forward
   flow through heart and increase CO.  [**Month (only) 51**] have better CO if not in Afib
   with RVR which has been exacerbated by levophed. Will d/w HD.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including CKD V, failed renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed. He was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and hypothermia. 

Key Events:
- Patient's blood pressures were in the 100s on the floor and improved to the 60s-70s with the use of levophed.
- Heart rate was in the 140s, which decreased to the 110s after a fluid bolus and packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
- The patient agreed to below-knee amputation (BKA) during a family meeting, and vascular surgery is aware and will take him when medically stable.
- The patient received hemodialysis yesterday, and a continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) was planned for today as per HD recommendations. However, no fluid was removed yesterday due to hypotension.
- The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) showed interstitial edema and slightly improved retro-cardiac opacities on the left.
- The patient's urine culture grew yeast, which is likely a contaminant.
- The patient has been on norepinephrine (0.06 mcg/kg/min) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.

   -          resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   -          Has had tachycardia (afib with RVR) since starting levophed.
   Slightly responsive to fluid bolus and pRBCs O/N. As pressures better
   hesitate to d/c the levophed but may need a different pressor.

   hemodialysis
   - d/w renal re prednisone taper
   - HD yesterday. Renal aware. [**Month (only) 51**] get CVVH today per HD recs.
   - Will follow up HD recs to see how much fluid he needs off
 if any.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failed renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was admitted to the MICU for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

24-hour events:
1. Blood pressures on the floor were in the 100s even without an arterial line, indicating potential underestimation of true readings. The patient was started on levophed to improve blood pressure, which improved but resulted in a heart rate of 140s. Levophed was weaned after a fluid bolus, and heart rates came down to 110s with mean arterial pressures (MAPs) at ~65.
2. The patient agreed to below-knee amputation (BKA), and vascular surgery is aware and will take him when medically stable.
3. The patient received hemodialysis (HD) with one unit packed red blood cells (pRBCs), midodrine, and albumin yesterday. Hematocrit increased from 25 to 29.7.
4. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed interstitial edema and slightly improved retro-cardiac opacities on the left.
5. Cardiology suggested Swan-Ganz catheterization and myocardial oxygen consumption measurements to assess cardiac output. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) was"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.
   -CVVH seems to be tolated well and removing fluids
   -Had started stress dose steroids yesterday for ?of adrenal
   insufficiency. No change to hypotension so will decrease to home dose
   of prednisone.
   2. Hypothermia: One temp at 95F infectious workup as mentioned; Heating
   blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.  Will d/c antibiotics today
   as only treating MRSA positive swab and no other positive cultures.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improving with CVVH
   - Resp status improving
 last ABG very good.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA; cont vancomycin and empiric ceftazidime and
   follow up cultures
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following will likely get BKA tomorrow.
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now around 30 although today slight drop.
   - Will check Hct in 6 hours to ensure no further drop. If drop will
   transfuse.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   -          Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed
   but now better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - d/w renal re prednisone taper
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient refuses glargine at
   bedtime one night and last night did not receive until 1am so will
   recheck blood sugars over the day and re-dose glargine as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was transferred to the MICU for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, requiring the use of levophed to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAPs >60). Lactate levels have improved, suggesting better tissue perfusion. The echocardiogram (TTE) showed no major changes in cardiac function, and it is believed that his longstanding severe congestive heart failure may be causing the hypotension.

2. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature dropped to 95F, and an infectious workup is pending. A heating blanket has been initiated to keep the patient warm, and his temperature is being closely monitored.

3. Hypoxia: The patient likely has pulmonary edema due to acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure. His respiratory status is improving with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

4. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a wound swab positive for MRSA, and he is already receiving vancomycin and empiric ceftazidime. He has decided to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.
   -CVVH seems to be tolated well and removing fluids
   2. Hypothermia: One temp at 95F infectious workup as mentioned; Heating
   blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improving with CVVH
   - Resp status improving
 last ABG very good.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA; cont vancomycin and empiric ceftazidime and
   follow up cultures
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now around 30 although today slight drop.
   - Will check Hct in 6 hours to ensure no further drop. If drop will
   transfuse.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   -          Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed.
   Slightly responsive to fluid bolus and pRBCs O/N. As pressures better
   hesitate to d/c the levophed but may need a different pressor.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - d/w renal re prednisone taper
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient refuses glargine at
   bedtime most nights.
   10. Vancomycin level high. Will hold morning dose today and check level
   before dose tonight.

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 60s, requiring norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60. Lactate levels have decreased, indicating improving tissue perfusion.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed to assess cardiac function, showing no significant changes except for severe CHF, which could explain the hypotension without sepsis.
- Blood cultures were obtained to evaluate for bacteremia/sepsis.
- Blood pressure medications were temporarily held, along with Flomax.
- Norepinephrine will continue to be administered to maintain a MAP goal of 65.
- Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) is being tolerated well and is removing fluids. Respiratory status is improving.

2. Hypothermia: An infectious workup is ongoing; the patient does not currently complain of chills or fever. Temperature monitoring will continue.
3. Hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of failed renal transplant and severe congestive heart failure. He presented with hypotension believed to be due to severe congestive heart failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for critical care.

24-hour events include a trans thoracic echo showing severely depressed ejection fraction, unchanged from the prior study. The patient had a PICC line inserted and stopped, and then restarted. He received vancomycin and ceftazidime antibiotics.

The patient is currently on several medications, including potassium chloride (KCl) and calcium gluconate through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), norepinephrine for hemodynamic support, and pantoprazole. He also takes prednisone, Lipitor, iron sulfate (FeSO4), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), papain, urea, sodium starch iodine (SSI), and glargine.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9Â°C (96.6Â°F), heart rate of 84 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 89/53 mmHg to 104/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. His weight is currently 119.8 kg, and he is 72 inches tall.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,612 mL, with 2,490 mL going into the pulmonary artery catheter (TF) and 3,382 mL going into the inferior vena cava (IVF). The total output was 2,982 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,630 mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.0 g/dL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 55 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 51 K/uL, creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, chloride of 28 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 23 mEq/L, BUN/Creatinine ratio of 18, glucose of 267 mg/dL, and pH of 7.47.

Assessment and plan:
The patient remains critically ill with hypotension, severe dilated cardiomyopathy, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, and acute on chronic renal failure. He requires low-dose norepinephrine and continues on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to remove fluid. His respiratory distress has improved, and his heart rate is under control. The decision to stop antibiotics for lower extremity osteomyelitis has been made, as there is no evidence of systemic infection. Prednisone dosage will be tapered down to 5 mg. Glucose control needs improvement, which can"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.
   -CVVH seems to be tolated well and removing fluids
   -Had started stress dose steroids yesterday for ?of adrenal
   insufficiency. No change to hypotension so will decrease to home dose
   of prednisone.
   2. Hypothermia: One temp at 95F infectious workup as mentioned; Heating
   blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.  Will d/c antibiotics today
   as only treating MRSA positive swab and no other positive cultures.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improving with CVVH
   - Resp status improving
 last ABG very good.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA; cont vancomycin and empiric ceftazidime and
   follow up cultures
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following will likely get BKA tomorrow.
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now around 30 although today slight drop.
   - Will check Hct in 6 hours to ensure no further drop. If drop will
   transfuse.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   -          Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed
   but now better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - d/w renal re prednisone taper
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient refuses glargine at
   bedtime one night and last night did not receive until 1am so will
   recheck blood sugars over the day and re-dose glargine as needed.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 91/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at a rate of 0.04 mcg/kg/min, calcium gluconate (continuous renal replacement therapy) at 1.4 grams/hour, and potassium chloride (continuous renal replacement therapy) at 1 mEq./hour.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 48,000/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 51,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 28 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, chloride of 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 28.8%, glucose of 237 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.9 mg/dL, calcium of 9.1 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.9 g/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been on norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60. Lactate levels have improved, indicating better tissue perfusion.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no major changes except for severe chronic heart failure.
- Blood cultures will be followed up to assess for bacteremia or sepsis.
- Blood pressure medications and tamsulosin will be held for now.
- Levophed will continue to maintain a MAP goal of 65.
- Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) is tolerated well and is removing fluids.
- Stress dose steroids were started yesterday for possible adrenal insufficiency, but the patient's hypotension did not improve, so the dose of prednisone will be decreased.

2. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is stable, but one reading at 95Â°F requires further investigation. A heating blanket will be used to keep the patient warm, and temperature will be monitored closely. Antibiotics will be discontinued today since the patient only has a positive MRSA swab without any other positive cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C (97.2Â°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 91/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He is currently on norepinephrine infusion at 0.04 mcg/kg/min for hemodynamic support and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration) for fluid management.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent events.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolated well and removing fluids
   -Had started stress dose steroids possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   but there was change in hypotension.  So decreased back to home dose of
   prednisone.
   2. Hypothermia: One temp at 95F infectious workup as mentioned; Heating
   blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.  Will d/c antibiotics today
   as only treating MRSA positive swab and no other positive cultures.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improving with CVVH
   - Resp status improving
 last ABG very good.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA; cont vancomycin and empiric ceftazidime and
   follow up cultures
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following will likely get BKA tomorrow.
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now around 30 although today slight drop.
   - Will check Hct in 6 hours to ensure no further drop. If drop will
   transfuse.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   -          Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed
   but now better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - d/w renal re prednisone taper
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient refuses glargine at
   bedtime one night and last night did not receive until 1am so will
   recheck blood sugars over the day and re-dose glargine as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failed renal transplant, osteomyelitis, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension and hypothermia. The patient required norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and has shown improvement in lactate levels, suggesting better cardiac output and perfusion. There are no significant changes in the echocardiogram (TTE) other than severe chronic CHF. Blood cultures were ordered to assess for bacteremia/sepsis. Blood pressure medications and Flomax were held. Norepinephrine will continue to be administered for a MAP goal of 65, attempting to wean it off once stable. CVVH seems to be tolerated well, removing fluids effectively. The patient may restart ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers after being off pressors. Stress dose steroids were initially considered for possible adrenal insufficiency but were decreased back to home dose of prednisone as there was no change in hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to longstanding severe CHF, which may explain his low blood pressure without the need to invoke sepsis. The goal is to maintain a MAP of 65 with levophed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
 first
   sets all negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolated well and removing fluids: goal now is
   150mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour.
   -Had started stress dose steroids possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   but there was change in hypotension.  So decreased back to home dose of
   prednisone.
   2. Hypothermia: temps in nl range o/n. infectious workup as mentioned;
   Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improving with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka when cardiovascularly stable
 hopefully Monday.
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          resume warfarin once GI workup completed
   -          Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed
   but now better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient refuses glargine at
   bedtime one night and last night did not receive until 1am so will
   recheck blood sugars over the day and re-dose glargine as needed.

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failed renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient has been receiving norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg. His lactate levels have improved, indicating better tissue perfusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no major changes except for his longstanding severe congestive heart failure, which may explain his hypotension without suggesting sepsis.

The patient's blood cultures have been negative, ruling out bacteremia and sepsis. His blood pressure medications and Flomax have been held. The goal is to wean off norepinephrine once his condition stabilizes, and then restart angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers.

The patient has been undergoing continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) well, with the goal of removing 150 mL/hour of ultrafiltrate. His fluid balance has been monitored closely.

The patient's temperature has normalized overnight, and he is being kept warm with a heating blanket. An infectious workup is ongoing.

The patient's respiratory status has improved with CV"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. 

1. Systolic HF (Heart Failure) and fluid overload: The patient continues to have symptoms of heart failure, and fluid removal through CVVH (continuous venovenous hemodialysis) is ongoing. The goal is to remove around 1-2 liters of fluid per day.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, so an insulin drip will be started to manage hyperglycemia.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and CVVH will be continued to support kidney function.

4. LE ulcer: The patient has a lower extremity ulcer, and a below-knee amputation (BKA) is planned for next week.

5. AFIB (Atrial Fibrillation): The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which requires close monitoring and management.

6. NSVT (Non-sustained Ventricular Tachycardia): The patient also has episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, necessitating the monitoring of electrolyte levels.

In addition to these primary issues, the patient is also on various medications for other conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, iron deficiency anemia, depression, and as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with systolic heart failure and fluid overload. They are receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) to remove excess fluids, as well as low-dose levophed to maintain blood pressure. The patient also has hyperglycemia, renal failure, a lower extremity ulcer with plans for below-knee amputation next week, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's electrolytes and other lab values are being closely monitored. The patient is on multiple medications including insulin, heparin, midodrine, and lipitor. They are receiving nutritional support and have various lines and catheters in place for ongoing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's systolic heart failure and fluid overload indicate a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function.
2. Hypotension: The use of low-dose levophed suggests that the patient's blood pressure may be unstable and could potentially drop, requiring adjustments in medication or other interventions.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes. Without appropriate management, this could lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or an increased risk of infections.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. This could progress to complete renal failure if not managed appropriately.
5. Infection: The presence of an LE ulcer raises the concern for potential infection. Proper wound care and antibiotic management"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
 first
   sets all negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolated well and removing fluids: goal now is
   150mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour.
   -Had started stress dose steroids possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   but there was change in hypotension.  So decreased back to home dose of
   prednisone.
   - Given volume overload with difficult to control pressures, will
   switch as many meds as possible to Pos
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of mitodrine
   2. Hypothermia: temps in nl range o/n. infectious workup as mentioned;
   Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improving with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka Monday. [**2193-9-16**]
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          hold warfarin pending amputation.
   -          Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed
   but now better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient refuses glargine at
   bedtime one night and last night did not receive until 1am so will
   recheck blood sugars over the day and re-dose glargine as needed.

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was transferred to the medical ICU for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/47 mmHg to 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.04 mcg/kg/min, calcium gluconate (CRRT) at 1.4 grams/hour, and potassium chloride (CRRT) at 2 mEq/hour.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned below. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is at high risk for future cardioembolic phenomena. He has chronic kidney disease stage V with a failed renal transplant and is now back on hemodialysis. The patient also has thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, diabetes mellitus, and osteomyelitis.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, no jugular venous distention, regular rhythm with no murmurs, bilateral crackles in the lungs, and "

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
 first
   sets all negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolated well and removing fluids: goal now is
   150mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour.
   -Had started stress dose steroids possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   but there was change in hypotension.  So decreased back to home dose of
   prednisone.
   2. Hypothermia: temps in nl range o/n. infectious workup as mentioned;
   Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improving with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka when cardiovascularly stable
 hopefully Monday.
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          hold warfarin pending amputation. Consider heparin
   -          Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed
   but now better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient refuses glargine at
   bedtime one night and last night did not receive until 1am so will
   recheck blood sugars over the day and re-dose glargine as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of CKD V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed. He was transferred to the MICU for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypothermia, hypoxia, osteomyelitis, acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed, atrial fibrillation, CKD V, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature may increase the risk of further complications and difficulties in maintaining physiological functions.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's impaired oxygenation may result in tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
4. Osteomyelitis: The infection in the patient's left heel can progress and spread, potentially leading to systemic infection.
5. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's decreased red blood cell count due to GI bleed may result in inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm increases the risk of clot formation, which can lead to stroke or other complications.
7. CKD V: The patient's kidney disease may worsen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with persistent hyperglycemia and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The patient's blood pressure remains low and requires ongoing support with norepinephrine. The patient is also receiving calcium gluconate and potassium chloride through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 87/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could potentially lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has persistent hyperglycemia, as evidenced by elevated glucose levels throughout the day. This could increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated BUN levels and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of AKI. This can occur due to factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephroto"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and ongoing hemodialysis (HD). They are currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient also has hyperglycemia, for which an insulin drip has been started. There are no known drug allergies.

The patient is receiving various infusions, including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and potassium chloride (CRRT). They are also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other medications such as Lipitor, Colace, protonix, prednisone, and trazodone.

The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission. Review of systems is also unchanged except as noted below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), a current temperature of 35.8Â°C (96.5Â°F), heart rate (HR) of 87 bpm with a range of 86-97 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 83/42 (57) mmHg to 94/54 (69) mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute with a range of 14-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's weight is currently 119.8 kg, with an admission weight of 111.6 kg. Height remains unchanged at 72 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 6,167 mL and output of 6,216 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 49 mL. Other fluid inputs and outputs are also recorded.

The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula and has been placed on respiratory support. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 28 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 150 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -3 mEq/L, and oxygen content (O2 content) of 28 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include normal pupils, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds with a systolic murmur, peripheral pulses rated 3+ on both extremities, and unassessed skin and neurologic status.

Lab results show hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 6.6 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 52 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 151 mg/dL, creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures for assessment of bacteremia/sepsis
 first
   sets all negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolated well and removing fluids: goal now is
   150mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour.
   -Had started stress dose steroids possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   but there was change in hypotension.  So decreased back to home dose of
   prednisone.
   - Given volume overload with difficult to control pressures, will
   switch as many meds as possible to Pos
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of mitodrine
   2. Hypothermia: temps in nl range o/n. infectious workup as mentioned;
   Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: likely pulmonary edema in the setting of acute-on-chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improving with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - patient decided would get BKA
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka Monday. [**2193-9-16**]
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -          hold warfarin pending amputation.
   -          Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed
   but now better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient refuses glargine at
   bedtime one night and last night did not receive until 1am so will
   recheck blood sugars over the day and re-dose glargine as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs include a blood pressure of 83/44 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He is being treated with calcium gluconate, norepinephrine, and potassium chloride via continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient's recent medical history includes a GI bleed, for which he required transfusions of packed red blood cells. He also has a history of osteomyelitis in his left heel and chronic CHF. His current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and insulin sliding scale for diabetes mellitus (DM).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures  (from [**9-8**] and [**9-9**])
 first sets all
   negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolerated well and removing fluids: goal now is
   150mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour.
   -Had started stress dose steroids possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   but there was change in hypotension.  So decreased back to home dose of
   prednisone.
   - Given volume overload with difficult to control pressures, will
   switch as many meds as possible to Pos
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of midodrine on [**9-13**] to 10mg TID
   2. Hypothermia: temps in nl range o/n. infectious workup as mentioned;
   Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: resolved; was likely [**2-23**] pulmonary edema in the setting of
   acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improved with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka Monday. [**2193-9-16**]
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   - hold warfarin pending amputation. However, pt has been clotting CVVH
   filter and may need some anticoag
   -  Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed but now
   better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale. Will need tighter control as
   sugars have been high overnight however patient has intermittently
   refused glargine at times.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including chronic kidney disease stage V (CKD V), osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.3Â°C (97.4Â°F)
- Heart rate: 87 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: 83/44 mmHg (systolic in the 80s)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient is receiving several medications, including calcium gluconate, norepinephrine, potassium chloride, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. He is also on a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has been placed on CVVH due to fluid overload and difficulty controlling pressures.

The patient's laboratory results show the following abnormalities:
- Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 7.2 thousand/mm3
- Platelet count: 47 thousand/mm3
- Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures  (from [**9-8**] and [**9-9**])
 first sets all
   negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolerated well and removing fluids: goal now is
   150mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour.
   -Had started stress dose steroids possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   but there was change in hypotension.  So decreased back to home dose of
   prednisone.
   - Given volume overload with difficult to control pressures, will
   switch as many meds as possible to Pos
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of midodrine on [**9-13**] to 10mg TID
   2. Hypothermia: most likely due to CVVH.  temps in nl range o/n.
   infectious workup as mentioned; Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont
   to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: resolved; was likely [**2-23**] pulmonary edema in the setting of
   acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improved with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka Monday. [**2193-9-16**]
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   - hold warfarin pending amputation. However, pt has been clotting CVVH
   filter and may need some anticoag
   -  Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed but now
   better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   - Will not  anticoag for CVVH filter clogging at this time.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale and glargine 40 un.  Can
   consider decreasing if too aggressive.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, hypothermia, hypoxia, osteomyelitis, acute blood loss anemia, atrial fibrillation, CKD V, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires continuous infusion of levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Lactate levels have decreased, indicating improved tissue perfusion. The cause of hypotension may be related to longstanding severe CHF, as suggested by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
2. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature was initially low, likely due to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Measures have been taken to keep the patient warm, including the use of a heating blanket.
3. Hypoxia: The patient experienced respiratory distress, which resolved with CVVH. It is likely that pulmonary edema contributed to the hypoxia, especially in the setting of acute-on-"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep SBPs
   >80s. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed but requiring more levophed as try to increase amount of
   fluid to take off.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis.
   - Did have urine culture positive for yeast. Unclear if contaminant or
   true isolate as patient is a transplant patient and may be susceptible
   to more rare infections like yeast. Will repeat urine culture today.
   Now on no antibiotics.
   - follow up blood cultures  (from [**9-8**] and [**9-9**])
 first sets all
   negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for SBP goal of 80.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolerated and have continued removing fluids: goal
   now is 100mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour. but is now
   requiring increased doses of levophed.
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of midodrine on [**9-13**] to 10mg TID
   2. Hypothermia: most likely due to CVVH.  temps in nl range o/n.
   infectious workup as mentioned; Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont
   to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: resolved; was likely [**2-23**] pulmonary edema in the setting of
   acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improved with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka Monday. [**2193-9-16**]
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   - hold warfarin pending amputation. However, pt has been clotting CVVH
   filter and may need some anticoag
   -  Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed but now
   better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   - Will not  anticoag for CVVH filter clogging at this time.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale and glargine 40 un.  Can
   consider decreasing if too aggressive.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CKD V, renal transplant failure, osteomyelitis, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF, and recent GI bleed. He is currently in the MICU for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension requiring the use of levophed to maintain SBPs >80s. Lactate levels have decreased, indicating improving CO/perfusion with levophed. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with a CHADS2 score of 5, indicating a high risk for future cardioembolic events. He is on CVVH for fluid management and has been tolerating it well, with the goal of removing 100mL/hour. The patient's hypoxia has resolved, likely due to CVVH and improvement in pulmonary edema. He is also being treated for osteomyelitis with an upcoming bka on Monday. The patient has acute blood loss anemia due to a GI bleed and is being held on warfarin until a GI workup can be pursued. He has thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology, but could be related to azathioprine. Lastly, the patient has diabetes and is on insulin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep MAPs
   >60. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis
   - follow up blood cultures  (from [**9-8**] and [**9-9**])
 first sets all
   negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for MAP goal of 65.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolerated well and removing fluids: goal now is
   150mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour.
   -Had started stress dose steroids possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   but there was change in hypotension.  So decreased back to home dose of
   prednisone.
   - Given volume overload with difficult to control pressures, will
   switch as many meds as possible to Pos
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of midodrine on [**9-13**] to 10mg TID
   2. Hypothermia: most likely due to CVVH.  temps in nl range o/n.
   infectious workup as mentioned; Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont
   to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: resolved; was likely [**2-23**] pulmonary edema in the setting of
   acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improved with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka Monday. [**2193-9-16**]
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   - hold warfarin pending amputation. However, pt has been clotting CVVH
   filter and may need some anticoag
   -  Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed but now
   better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   - Will not  anticoag for CVVH filter clogging at this time.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale and glargine 40 un.  Can
   consider decreasing if too aggressive.

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He has been transferred to the MICU for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/49 mmHg to 65/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. He is in atrial fibrillation with a regular ventricular response.

The patient's physical examination reveals generalized edema throughout the groin and lower abdomen, 2+ lower extremity edema, and no skin changes assessed. His neurological examination shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and is oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results indicate the following abnormalities:
- Hemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 25.0%
- White blood cell count: 6.4 K/uL
- Platelet count: 61 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
- Glucose: 99 mg/dL
- Potassium: 5.8 mEq/L
- Sodium: 136 mEq/L
- Chloride: 102 mEq/L
- Carbon dioxide: 28 mEq/L

The patient is currently receiving several medications, including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), and others. He is also undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with a goal of removing 100 mL/hour.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains in the 60s despite being on norepinephrine. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) has been performed, revealing no major changes except for his longstanding severe congestive heart failure. Blood cultures from previous sets have come back negative. The patient's blood pressure medications and Flomax are being held. Levophed is being continued for a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65, and attempts will be made to wean off the medication once the patient is stable on renal dosing. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers will be restarted once off pressors.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is within normal limits overnight, likely due to CVVH. A heating blanket has been applied, and the patient will continue to be monitored for hypothermia.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status has improved with CVVH, and his arterial blood gases (ABGs) are now"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with norepinephrine and other medications for various conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 93/49 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with calcium gluconate and potassium chloride. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for edema throughout the groin and lower abdomen, classified as 2+.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 93/49 mmHg, indicating potential hypotension. This could be due to septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

2. Fluid overload: The patient has received a total of 6,959 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 8,098 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -1,139 mL. This suggests ongoing fluid overload, which may require adjustment of fluid administration or diuretic therapy.

3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 6.4 K/uL, indicating hyperkalemia. This could be related to renal dysfunction or potassium supplementation during CRRT"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep SBPs
   >80s. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed but requiring more levophed as try to increase amount of
   fluid to take off. Hopefully with more fluid off he will have better CO
   and will require less levo. Now down 8 kg since [**2193-9-10**]. Dry weight is
   100kg though and still at 111 today.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis.
   - Did have urine culture positive for yeast. Unclear if contaminant or
   true isolate as patient is a transplant patient and may be susceptible
   to more rare infections like yeast. Will repeat urine culture today.
   Now on no antibiotics.
   - follow up blood cultures  (from [**9-8**] and [**9-9**])
 first sets all
   negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for SBP goal of 80.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolerated and have continued removing fluids: goal
   now is 100mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour. but is now
   requiring increased doses of levophed.
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of midodrine on [**9-13**] to 10mg TID
   2. Hypothermia: most likely due to CVVH.  temps in nl range o/n.
   infectious workup as mentioned; Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont
   to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: resolved; was likely [**2-23**] pulmonary edema in the setting of
   acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improved with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka Monday. [**2193-9-16**]
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   - hold warfarin pending amputation. However, pt has been clotting CVVH
   filter and may need some anticoag
   -  Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed but now
   better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   - Will not  anticoag for CVVH filter clogging at this time.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale and glargine 40 un.  Can
   consider decreasing if too aggressive.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Diabetic/Low sodium/heart healthy diet NPO after MN tonight
   for BKA tomorrow.
   Glycemic Control:  ISS with 40units Glargine QHS (Half dose tonight for
   procedure). Has had low morning BGTs so will back off glargine standing
   dose to 36units qhs once procedure done

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was transferred to the MICU for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/49 mmHg to 71/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Physical examination findings include edema throughout the groin and lower abdomen, as well as bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is incomplete.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, decreased hemoglobin, leukocyte count within normal limits, platelet count slightly decreased, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is on multiple medications, including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and others.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressures greater than 60. Lactate levels have improved, indicating better perfusion.
2. Hypothermia: Most likely caused by CVVH. The patient's temperature is now within normal"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They have a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, chronic renal failure, osteomyelitis, diabetes mellitus type II, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently being treated with various medications and therapies, including CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, and midodrine. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have low blood pressure and are on mechanical ventilation. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, kidney function, and blood glucose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation puts them at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart attack, or heart failure exacerbation.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's chronic renal failure and ongoing CVVH treatment increase the risk of further kidney damage or inadequate fluid removal.
3. Infection: The presence of osteomyelitis and potential use of indwelling lines or catheters may increase the risk of infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and current high blood glucose levels indicate the need for close glycemic control to prevent"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic systolic heart failure. They have undergone significant weight removal but still have excess weight due to fluid overload. The patient is also diagnosed with hypertension, chronic renal failure, osteomyelitis, diabetes mellitus type II, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure puts them at risk for further cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or heart failure exacerbation.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's chronic renal failure may lead to worsening kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload, increasing the risk of acute kidney injury or uremia.
3. Infection: The patient's presence of osteomyelitis raises the concern for potential infection spread, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to their risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and potential respiratory failure.
5. Bleeding Risk: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering their current critical condition and possible invasive procedures.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II requires careful monitoring and management of blood sugar levels to prevent hyperglycemic crises.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep SBPs
   >80s. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed but requiring more levophed as try to increase amount of
   fluid to take off. Hopefully with more fluid off he will have better CO
   and will require less levo. Now down 8 kg since [**2193-9-10**]. Dry weight is
   100kg though and still at 111 today (was 111 on admission).
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis.
   - Did have urine culture positive for yeast. Unclear if contaminant or
   true isolate as patient is a transplant patient and may be susceptible
   to more rare infections like yeast. Will repeat urine culture today.
   Now on no antibiotics.
   - follow up blood cultures from [**9-14**].  [**9-8**] and [**9-9**] blood cultures are
   negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for SBP goal of 80.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolerated and have continued removing fluids: goal
   now is 100mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour. but is now
   requiring increased doses of levophed.
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of midodrine on [**9-13**] to 10mg TID
   2. Hypothermia: most likely due to CVVH.  temps in nl range o/n.
   infectious workup as mentioned; Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont
   to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: resolved; was likely [**2-23**] pulmonary edema in the setting of
   acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improved with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - vascular surgery following; to OR today for BKA
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   -  holding warfarin pending amputation. Can consider restarting today
   or tomorrow.
   -  Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed but now
   better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   - Will not  anticoag for CVVH filter clogging at this time.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Decreased pt
s standing nighttime dose of Glargine from 40 to 36
   un on [**9-15**] as pt was hypoglycemic in the am.  Patient also on insulin
   sliding scale.  Last night, halved dose to 18un as pt was NPO.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Diabetic/Low sodium/heart healthy diet NPO since MN for BKA
   today.
   Glycemic Control:  ISS with 40units Glargine QHS (Half dose tonight for
   procedure). Has had low morning BGTs so will back off glargine standing
   dose to 36units qhs once procedure done

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage V, failed renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension and hypothermia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires continuous infusion of norepinephrine to maintain systolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg. His lactate levels have decreased, indicating improvement in tissue perfusion.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is likely due to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Measures such as using a heating blanket are being implemented to keep the patient warm.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status has improved with CVVH, and his arterial blood gases (ABGs) are within normal limits.
4. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a wound swab positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and he is scheduled to undergo below-knee amputation (BKA) today.
5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: The patient's hematocrit has stabilized over the past few days. It is planned to hold warfarin and pursue a GI work"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now with failure of a renal
   transplant, osteomyelitis of his left heel, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF, and a recent GI bleed who is now transferred to the MICU
   for increased monitoring in the setting of hypotension and hypothermia.
   1. Hypotension: on floor were getting SBPs in 100s so likely SBPs in
   60s here not just [**2-23**] poor [**Location (un) **]. Has required levophed to keep SBPs
   >80s. Lactate decreased today (1.5). Likely getting better CO/perfusion
   with levophed but requiring more levophed as try to increase amount of
   fluid to take off. Hopefully with more fluid off he will have better CO
   and will require less levo. Now down 8 kg since [**2193-9-10**]. Dry weight is
   100kg though and still at 111 today.
   - TTE: No major changes in ECHO other than his longstanding severe CHF,
   which may explain his hypotension without invoking sepsis.
   - Did have urine culture positive for yeast. Unclear if contaminant or
   true isolate as patient is a transplant patient and may be susceptible
   to more rare infections like yeast. Will repeat urine culture today.
   Now on no antibiotics.
   - follow up blood cultures  (from [**9-8**] and [**9-9**])
 first sets all
   negative.
   - holding BP meds as well as Flomax for now
   -Continuing levophed for SBP goal of 80.  Attempting to wean levo and
   per renal, once off pressors, restart ACE and then BB
   -CVVH seems to be tolerated and have continued removing fluids: goal
   now is 100mL/hour. Has been anywhere from 0-150mL/hour. but is now
   requiring increased doses of levophed.
   - Daily weights
   - Increase dose of midodrine on [**9-13**] to 10mg TID
   2. Hypothermia: most likely due to CVVH.  temps in nl range o/n.
   infectious workup as mentioned; Heating blanket on to keep warm; cont
   to monitor.
   3. Hypoxia: resolved; was likely [**2-23**] pulmonary edema in the setting of
   acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF
   - Improved with CVVH
   - Resp status stable with nl abgs.
   4. Osteomyelitis:
   - wound swab with MRSA;
   - vascular surgery following. Will get bka Monday. [**2193-9-16**]
   5. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: hematocrit has been stable
   for several days now.
   - cont to hold warfarin for now and pursue GI workup once more stable
   - follow Hcts
   6. Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 5 indicating high risk for
   future cardioembolic phenomenon
   - hold warfarin pending amputation. However, pt has been clotting CVVH
   filter and may need some anticoag
   -  Had some tachycardia (afib with RVR) when started levophed but now
   better.
   7. CKD V: renal transplant now considered failed and he is back on
   hemodialysis
   - On CVVH now per HD recs as-fluid management
   - Will not  anticoag for CVVH filter clogging at this time.
   8. Thrombocytopenia: etiology unclear, though could be due to
   azathioprine (recently stopped); PF4 antibody negative
   - trend for now; consider hematology consultation if it doesn
t improve
   with removal of azathioprine
   9. DM: Patient on insulin sliding scale and glargine 40 un.  Can
   consider decreasing if too aggressive.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Diabetic/Low sodium/heart healthy diet NPO after MN tonight
   for BKA tomorrow.
   Glycemic Control:  ISS with 40units Glargine QHS (Half dose tonight for
   procedure). Has had low morning BGTs so will back off glargine standing
   dose to 36units qhs once procedure done

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, failure of a renal transplant, osteomyelitis of the left heel, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for increased monitoring due to hypotension and hypothermia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, requiring the use of norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure above 80 mmHg. His lactate levels have decreased, indicating improved tissue perfusion. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with a high CHADS2 score, indicating a high risk for future cardioembolic events. He has a history of diabetes and is currently on insulin sliding scale and glargine 40 units per night. The patient's thrombocytopenia etiology is unclear, but it could be related to azathioprine use. He is also on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) for fluid management and will undergo below-knee amputation (BKA) tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite the use of norepinephrine may indicate a more severe underlying condition such as sepsis or cardiac dysfunction.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia is likely due to CVV"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have been admitted to the ICU and underwent below-knee amputation (BKA) for osteomyelitis. The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 7.5 g/dL, indicating possible anemia. They have atrial fibrillation (AF), acute on chronic systolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The low hemoglobin level may lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and organs. This can cause fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and increased risk of infections.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: AF increases the risk of blood clots formation, which can result in stroke or other embolic events. It can also lead to palpitations, dizziness, and reduced cardiac output.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: This condition can worsen the patient's cardiovascular status, leading to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
4. Osteomyelitis: The infection in the bones may spread and cause sepsis, leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's impaired kidney function can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and increased risk of infections.
6. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V and PVD now s/p left BKA who
   had an acute aspiration event earlier today requiring intubation and
   bronchoscopy.
   ## Respiratory failure: due to acute aspiration event, though it's
   unclear what triggered him to aspirate since his mental status had
   reportedly been normal and he had been on room air
   - pulmonary toilet
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - MDIs as needed
   .
   ## Osteomyelitis:
   - cont ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for now; change linezolid to
   daptomycin since linezolid can worsen thrombocytopenia
   .
   ## Hypotension: etiology has remained somewhat unclear, though thought
   to be intravascularly volume depleted (in spite of extravascular volume
   overload)
   - cont norepinephrine as needed and try to wean
   - given positive blood culture, will broaden gram-positive coverage to
   daptomycin and check surveillance blood cultures
   .
   ## CKD V
   - cont low-dose prednisone per renal team given his long-term
   immunosuppression regimen; gradual taper
   - cont CVVH per renal
   .
   ## Acute-on-chronic systolic CHF: volume being managed by CVVH; on
   amiodarone for beta blockade
   .
   ## Chronic atrial fibrillation:
   - on amiodarone for rate control
   - holding heparin due to coagulopathy
   .
   ## Coagulopathy: likely due to heparin infusion
   - recheck PTT and cont holding heparin; likely doesn't need heparin
   bridging and can simply resume warfarin once stable
   .
   ## Thrombocytopenia: presumed due to azathioprine therapy, though this
   has persisted in spite of withdrawl of azathioprine
   - cont to monitor; consider heme consult
   .
   ## DM2: on glargine with HISS; will halve glargine dose given NPO
   status now that he is intubated
   .
   ## Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed
   - no active bleeding
   - cont ppi and readdress once more stable
   .
   ## FEN: NPO for now; tube feeds if unable to wean from vent quickly;
   lytes per CVVH
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin, ppi
   ## Access: dialysis catheter x2, arterial line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of CKD V and PVD who underwent left below-knee amputation. He experienced an acute aspiration event, leading to intubation and bronchoscopy. The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure due to aspiration, osteomyelitis, hypotension, CKD V, acute-on-chronic systolic CHF, chronic atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, DM2, acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Osteomyelitis: The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, but the infection may progress if the antibiotics are not effective. Regular assessment of wound healing and infection parameters is needed.
3. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension remains unclear, and it needs to be closely monitored. Adjustments to vasopressor support and fluid management may be required based on the patient's hemodynamic status.
4. CKD V: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and it requires careful monitoring. Adjustments to medication dosages and dialysis therapy may be necessary.
5. Acute-on-chronic systolic CHF: The patient's cardiac function is"

   Transferred to MICU from CVICU for resp failure after being found
   unresponsive thought to be secondary to aspiration.  S/p bronch.
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2193-9-20**] 11:37 PM
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2193-9-20**] 11:37 PM
   - Upon arrival, pt thought to have only 3 usable ports, with two being
   used for CVVH.  The one remaining port was used for levo, fentanyl,
   versed, vasopressin, and daptomycin running together (all compatible).
   - Attempted to clear other lines with tPA; will try again
   - On arrival to the MICU, pt was noted to be having runs of ectopy.
   Changed from propofol (not compatible thru line) to fentanyl/versed and
   ectopy seemed to improve.
   - Discovered that pt was receving 4 times dose of levophed.  Had
   thought to be infusing 0.15 mcg but in reality was 0.4mcg (due to elev
   concentration of levo in bag).  Attempted to decrease, and pts
   pressures did not tolerate.  MAPs decreased to 55-60s.  Added
   vasopressin to regimen with improvement in MAPs.
   - PTT down to 42

   .Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V and PVD now s/p left BKA
   who had an acute aspiration event yesterday requiring intubation and
   bronchoscopy
   ## Shock:  Differential includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency,
   and cardiogenic shock.  Most likely etiology is aspiration with
   resulting infection.
   -ID consult- to cover empirically for MRSA, documented VRE in a
   thrombocytopenic pt, need to cover fungal sources
   - For now, vanc (MRSA), dapto (VRE), zosyn and cipro (hospital acq
   PNA), flagyl (c. diff)
   -D/c lines.  Will need to go to IR for replacement
   TTE  to eval for endocarditits as well as cardiogenic shock
   -Check CVP to monitor volume status
   -Check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim and treat empirically at present, given chronic
   steroid use.
   -Pan-culture including C diff.
   -Continue levophed and vasopressin until pressures improve
   ## Respiratory failure: due to acute aspiration event, though it's
   unclear what triggered him to aspirate since his mental status had
   reportedly been normal and he had been on room air.  Now complicated by
   shock
   - continue intubation for now given tenuous status
   .
   ## Osteomyelitis:
   - On multiple abx.  Has new ulcer on lateral right foot.  Continue to
   monitor
   .
   ## CKD V
   - cont low-dose prednisone per renal team given his long-term
   immunosuppression regimen; gradual taper
   - cont CVVH per renal
   .
   ## Acute-on-chronic systolic CHF: volume being managed by CVVH; on
   amiodarone for beta blockade
   .
   ## Chronic atrial fibrillation:
   - on amiodarone for rate control
   - holding heparin due to coagulopathy
   .
   ## Coagulopathy: likely due to heparin infusion
   - recheck PTT and cont holding heparin; likely doesn't need heparin
   bridging and can simply resume warfarin once stable
   .
   ## Thrombocytopenia: presumed due to azathioprine therapy, though this
   has persisted in spite of withdrawl of azathioprine
   - P4 negative
   .
   ## DM2: on glargine with HISS; will halve glargine dose given NPO
   status now that he is intubated

The most likely etiology is aspiration with resulting infection. An ID consult has been ordered to cover empirically for MRSA, documented VRE in a thrombocytopenic patient, and fungal sources. 

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to the acute aspiration event, although it is unclear what triggered the aspiration since the patient's mental status had reportedly been normal and he had been on room air. 

The patient also has osteomyelitis, which is being managed with multiple antibiotics. He has chronic kidney disease stage V, chronic atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type 2, acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed, and requires tube feeds. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 61/45 mmHg to 87/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old man with worsening shock and respiratory failure.
   Shock
   Differential includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, and
   cardiogenic shock.  Clinically, most likely event is aspiration with
   infection.  Other sources are possible.
          Check CVP
          Check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim and treat empirically at present, given
   chronic steroid use.
          Pan-culture including C diff.
          Need to cover VRE, MRSA, resistant GNR, C diff.  Ask ID to
   consult.  For now:
          Change dapto to linezolid (could consider vanco + dapto)
          Change cipro to IV
          Add Zosyn
          Discuss with ID re: covering yeast in urine, ESBL coverage,
   etc.
          Check echo today
          Discuss with ID regarding asking IR to resite lines.
   Intermittent subsequent cultures are reassuring.
   Respiratory failure
   Likely due to a combination of shock and aspiration.
   Leave intubated until shock more stable.
   Thrombocytopenia
   Follow for now.  PF4 negative.
   Atrial fibrillation
   [**Month (only) 51**] need to resume heparin once platelets up.
   Diabetes
   ARF on CVVHD
   Continue CVVHD for now

   Critical Care Staff Addendum
   2pm
   Hemodynamics have worsened throughout the day.  He is now on levophed,
   vasopressin, and dopamine with SBPs in 60s.  We are stopping CVVHD and
   adding neosynephrine.
   ID
s help appreciated.  We will plan on the following for antibiotics:
   linezolid, meropenem, aminoglyside, fluconazole.
   EKG does not show new STEMI.
   CXR to exclude pneumothorax is pending.
   He has received empiric steroids in case this is adrenal insufficiency.
   We have asked his family to come in, since his prognosis is extremely
   grave and he may not survive the day.
   If his CXR does not show pneumothorax, we will plan:
          Stat echo
          Goal CVP > 15 (met already)
          Antibiotics as above
          Electrolyte management
          Recheck Hct to exclude occult bleeding
          Based on the above, may need further evaluation.
          Will discuss with pt
s wife when she arrives.

   7p addendum
   Shock worsened
 vaso + levo + neo + dopa + epi.
   Transfused and BP increased, now off of epi.  CVP about 20.
   Left IJ placed under u/s guidance for additional access.
   The major hope of survival is if this represents adrenal
   insufficiency.  If it is mesenteric ischemia or intra-abdominal
   catastrophe then the chance of survival is essentially absent.  Too
   sick for CT scan for now and clearly too sick for laparotomy.  Will
   continue volume challenge for now and try to wean neo next.
   Discussed in detail with family.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with a complicated medical history who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He has been on multiple medications and interventions, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). 

The patient's current condition is critical, and he is experiencing worsening shock with hemodynamics that have declined throughout the day. He requires support with levophed, vasopressin, dopamine, and neosynephrine to maintain stable blood pressure. CVVHD has been stopped, and he will be started on neosynephrine.

The medical team suspects that the patient may have septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, or cardiogenic shock. They are considering various potential causes, including aspiration with infection, and are planning further diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram (echo) to check for cardiac function and a chest X-ray (CXR) to rule out pneumothorax.

In terms of management, the patient will receive broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible infections, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria. They will also add coverage for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and yeast in the urine.

Other ongoing care includes glycemic control with regular"

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old man with worsening shock and respiratory failure.
   Shock
   Differential includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, and
   cardiogenic shock.  Clinically, most likely event is aspiration with
   infection.  Other sources are possible.
          Check CVP
          Check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim and treat empirically at present, given
   chronic steroid use.
          Pan-culture including C diff.
          Need to cover VRE, MRSA, resistant GNR, C diff.  Ask ID to
   consult.  For now:
          Change dapto to linezolid (could consider vanco + dapto)
          Change cipro to IV
          Add Zosyn
          Discuss with ID re: covering yeast in urine, ESBL coverage,
   etc.
          Check echo today
          Discuss with ID regarding asking IR to resite lines.
   Intermittent subsequent cultures are reassuring.
   Respiratory failure
   Likely due to a combination of shock and aspiration.
   Leave intubated until shock more stable.
   Thrombocytopenia
   Follow for now.  PF4 negative.
   Atrial fibrillation
   [**Month (only) 51**] need to resume heparin once platelets up.
   Diabetes
   ARF on CVVHD
   Continue CVVHD for now

   Hemodynamics have worsened throughout the day.  He is now on levophed,
   vasopressin, and dopamine with SBPs in 60s.  We are stopping CVVHD and
   adding neosynephrine.
   ID
s help appreciated.  We will plan on the following for antibiotics:
   linezolid, meropenem, aminoglyside, fluconazole.
   EKG does not show new STEMI.
   CXR to exclude pneumothorax is pending.
   He has received empiric steroids in case this is adrenal insufficiency.
   We have asked his family to come in, since his prognosis is extremely
   grave and he may not survive the day.
   If his CXR does not show pneumothorax, we will plan:
          Stat echo
          Goal CVP > 15 (met already)
          Antibiotics as above
          Electrolyte management
          Recheck Hct to exclude occult bleeding
          Based on the above, may need further evaluation.
          Will discuss with pt

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with a complicated medical history who presented with respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU and has experienced several medical events and complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Shock: The patient is described as having worsening shock and the differential diagnosis includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, and cardiogenic shock. Immediate actions include checking the central venous pressure (CVP), treating empirically for possible infection, and covering for various resistant organisms.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of shock and aspiration. It is recommended to leave the patient intubated until the shock is more stable.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which may require further investigation and management.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and heparin therapy may be considered once the platelet count improves.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) due to acute kidney injury. CVVHD will be continued for now.

6. Nutrition: The patient should start tube feeding (TF) today for nutrition support.

7. Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale should be used for glycemic control.

8. Lines: The patient has multiple lines"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with a complicated medical history who presented with respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications and treatments.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), heart rate of 98 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 93/50 mmHg to 148/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient has several medical issues including shock, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, acute renal failure on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and a history of chronic steroid use.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal blood glucose levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs consistent with his medical conditions, such as clear breath sounds on the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and normal peripheral pulses.

The assessment and plan include treating the patient's shock, covering for potential infections including VRE, MRSA, resistant GNR, and C. difficile. The team is also monitoring for any complications related to the patient's conditions, such as thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes."

   Assessment and Plan
   .Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V and PVD now s/p left BKA
   who had an acute aspiration event yesterday requiring intubation and
   bronchoscopy and then developed.
   ## Shock:  Differential includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency,
   and cardiogenic shock.  Most likely combination of all three although
   septic and adrenal higher on differential as TTE nl.
   *Septic Shock:
   -ID consult- to cover empirically for MRSA, documented VRE in a
   thrombocytopenic pt, need to cover fungal sources
   -ID Recs: Linezolid, flagyl, tobramycin, fluconazole, meropenem
   -D/c
d lines and cultured tips.
   -Pan-cultured including C diff.
   *Cardiogenic Shock:
   -TTE  to eval for endocarditits as well as cardiogenic shock. No
   vegetations and EF 15% with no tamponade. No change from prior.
   -CVP has been 18 overnight.
   - CVVH had to be turned off as HD line was replaced. [**Month (only) 51**] need to
   restart it to get some fluid off.
   -Gradually weaning off pressors. Now on 4.
   *Adrenal Insufficiency:
   -[**Last Name (un) **] stim was not normal. Getting high dose steroids. Seems to be
   helping as pressors coming off.
   ## Respiratory failure: due to acute aspiration event, though it's
   unclear what triggered him to aspirate since his mental status had
   reportedly been normal and he had been on room air.  Now complicated by
   shock
   - continue intubation for now given tenuous status
   .
   ## Osteomyelitis:
   - On multiple abx.  Has new ulcer on lateral right foot.  Continue to
   monitor. Wound care consult ordered.
   .
   ## CKD V: New HD line placed yesterday and left subclavian HD line
   pulled and cultured as was not working.
   - cont CVVH per renal recs
   .
   ## Acute-on-chronic systolic CHF: volume being managed by CVVH; on
   amiodarone for beta blockade
   -TTE with no change from prior.  On pressors to inc CO.
   .
   ## Chronic atrial fibrillation:
   - on amiodarone for rate control
   - holding heparin due to coagulopathy
   .
   ## Coagulopathy: likely due to heparin infusion
   - recheck PTT and cont holding heparin; likely doesn't need heparin
   bridging and can simply resume warfarin once stable
   .
   ## Thrombocytopenia: presumed due to azathioprine therapy, though this
   has persisted in spite of withdrawl of azathioprine
   - P4 negative
   .
   ## DM2: on insulin sliding scale as sugars poorly controlled on
   steroids
   .
   ## Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed
   - no active bleeding
   - cont ppi and readdress once more stable
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds, replete lytes as needed
   ## Prophylaxis: ppi
   ## Access: RIJ dialysis catheter x1, LIJ CVL
   ## Full Code
   ## Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 1154**] [**Name (NI) 1153**]
   ## Dispo: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD V) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who underwent left below-knee amputation (BKA). He experienced an acute aspiration event yesterday that required intubation and bronchoscopy. Subsequently, he developed shock, which is likely a combination of septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, and cardiogenic shock. Other medical conditions include respiratory failure due to acute aspiration, osteomyelitis, acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), acute blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and feeding tube nutrition (FEN). The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics and receiving various treatments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover MRSA, documented VRE, and fungal sources. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is being evaluated through echocardiography (TTE) to assess for endocarditis and evaluate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). CVP levels should be closely monitored, and CVVH may be necessary to manage fluid balance.

   Assessment and Plan
   .Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V and PVD now s/p left BKA
   who had an acute aspiration event yesterday requiring intubation and
   bronchoscopy and then developed.
   ## Shock:  Differential includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency,
   and cardiogenic shock.  Most likely combination of all three.
   Attempting to wean off pressors today starting with dopamine.
   *Septic Shock:
   -ID consult- to cover empirically for MRSA, documented VRE in a
   thrombocytopenic pt, need to cover fungal sources
   -ID Recs: Linezolid, flagyl, tobramycin, fluconazole, meropenem
   -D/c
d lines and cultured tips.
   -Pan-cultured including C diff.
   *Cardiogenic Shock:
   -TTE  to eval for endocarditits as well as cardiogenic shock. No
   vegetations and EF 15% with no tamponade. No change from prior.
   -CVP has been 18 overnight.
   - CVVH had to be turned off as HD line was replaced. [**Month (only) 51**] need to
   restart it to get some fluid off.
   -Gradually weaning off pressors. Now on 4.
   *Adrenal Insufficiency:
   -[**Last Name (un) **] stim was not normal. Getting low dose steroids. Seems to be
   helping as pressors coming off.
   ## Respiratory failure: due to acute aspiration event, though it's
   unclear what triggered him to aspirate since his mental status had
   reportedly been normal and he had been on room air.  Now complicated by
   shock
   - continue intubation for now given tenuous status
   .
   ## Osteomyelitis:
   - On multiple abx.  Has new ulcer on lateral right foot.  Continue to
   monitor. Wound care consult ordered.
   .
   ## CKD V: New HD line placed yesterday and left subclavian HD line
   pulled and cultured as was not working. CVVH stopped yesterday in
   setting of shock.
   - cont CVVH today per renal recs with goal to keep even and take no
   fluid off but no more overload.
   .
   ##. Hyponatremia: likely [**2-23**] fluid overload.
   -Will restart CVVH today to try to make even and keep from more fluid
   overload.
   .
   ##. ? of hemothorax: Pulled Subclavian HD catheter yesterday and hct
   stable since but may be bleeding from this site. Too unstable to go to
   CT scan.
   -Will check Hcts Q6h.
   -Will get U/S if hct drops and worried bleeding into pleural space.
   .
   ## Acute-on-chronic systolic CHF: volume being managed by CVVH; on
   amiodarone for beta blockade
   -TTE with no change from prior.  On pressors to inc CO.
   -Fluid balance maintained with CVVH
   .
   ## Chronic atrial fibrillation:
   - on amiodarone for rate control
   - holding heparin due to coagulopathy
   .
   ## Coagulopathy: likely due to heparin infusion
   - recheck PTT and cont holding heparin; likely doesn't need heparin
   bridging and can simply resume warfarin once stable
   .
   ## Thrombocytopenia: presumed due to azathioprine therapy, though this
   has persisted in spite of withdrawl of azathioprine
   - P4 negative
   .
   ## DM2: on insulin sliding scale as sugars poorly controlled on
   steroids
   .
   ## Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed
   - no active bleeding
   - cont ppi and readdress once more stable
   .

   68 y/o man with multiple organ system failure.  He has improved
   substantially from yesterday and is currently down to three vasoactive
   medications (levophed, dobutamine, and vasopressin).
   Shock
   Substantial improvement since yesterday argues in favor of some
   meaningful component of adrenal insufficiency.  Most likely issue is
   probably aspiration
 infection that, in the setting of adrenal
   insufficiency, resulted in profound shock.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple organ system failure. He has been experiencing a significant improvement since yesterday and is currently on three vasoactive medications (levophed, dobutamine, and vasopressin). 

The patient's chief complaint is MOSF, which stands for multiple organ system failure. The patient's medical history includes obesity, atrial flutter, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/46 mmHg to 64/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 82%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2) of 72%, and cardiac output (CO) of 4.2 L/min. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 11,715 mL with outputs of 3,138 mL through urine, 96 mL through stool, and 200 mL through nasogastric tube. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's blood gases reveal a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 377 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 25 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -2 mEq/L. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.2 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 57 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 163 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.25 ng/mL. 

The patient's imaging includes a chest X-ray (CXR) showing increased markings, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) that is unchanged from prior. 

The patient's assessment and plan indicate that he is improving from multiple organ system failure, with a current need for three vasoactive medications. The likely issue is aspiration infection in the setting of adrenal insufficiency. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of organ function, infection, and the possibility of developing septic shock."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o man with multiple organ system failure.  He is obviously still
   tremendously ill, though he has improved substantially from yesterday
   and is currently down to three vasoactive medications (levophed,
   dobutamine, and vasopressin).
   Shock
   Substantial improvement since yesterday argues in favor of some
   meaningful component of adrenal insufficiency.  Most likely issue is
   probably aspiration
 infection that, in the setting of adrenal
   insufficiency, resulted in profound shock.  Ischemic bowel and other
   intra-abdominal issues are still possible.  At present, risks of
   transport to CT outweigh benefits.
   We will try to wean dopamine first.
   We
ll restart CVVH to try to keep him approximately even for the rest
   of the day.
   Respiratory failure
   Likely due to a combination of shock and aspiration.
   Leave intubated until shock more stable.
   Thrombocytopenia
   Follow for now.  PF4 negative.
   Atrial fibrillation
   [**Month (only) 51**] need to resume heparin once platelets up.
   Diabetes
   On insulin as needed
   ARF on CVVHD
   Continue CVVHD for now
   Left pleural effusion
   Likely CHF, though hemothorax is possible since HD line was removed on
   that side.  For now, we will follow Hcts.  If they fall, will
   ultrasound pleural space and consider diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].

   12:30pm
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1153**] developed full cardiac arrest with multiple rhythms,
   including PEA, bradycardia, and VFib.  Received ACLS with epinephrine,
   amiodarone, magnesium, CPR, and defibrillation.  Now with BP ~90/40 on
   leveophed, epinephrine, dobutamine, Neo,  levophed, and dopamine.  His
   family was not at bedside; I called his wife during the arrest and she

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple organ system failure, who remains critically ill but has shown improvement since yesterday. He is currently on three vasoactive medications (levophed, dobutamine, and vasopressin). 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Shock: The patient is still at risk for shock, especially considering the history of adrenal insufficiency and possible aspiration infection leading to profound shock. Continuous monitoring and management of hemodynamic parameters are crucial.

2. Ischemic bowel: The patient's condition may also be complicated by ischemic bowel due to inadequate blood supply. This can lead to abdominal pain, distension, and signs of peritonitis. Close monitoring of bowel activity and regular imaging studies may be necessary.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and careful monitoring of respiratory parameters is essential.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of bleeding parameters and appropriate management are necessary.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can complicate the clinical course. Anticoagulation therapy may be required to prevent thromboembolic events.

6. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, and tight glycemic control is important to prevent both hyper"
