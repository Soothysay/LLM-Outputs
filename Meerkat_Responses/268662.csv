   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
   79 y/o male with hepatitis c cirrhosis, elevated lactate, BRB per NG
   tube.
   # Hypotension/Bleed: Clearly there is a component of volume loss given
   his blood loss, unclear if there is sepsis.
   - Cultures obtained
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically
   - Crossmatch 8 units, transfuse 4 units at this time, 4 more on the
   way, FFPs as well.
   - Liver at bedside performing endoscopy now.
   - Tap ascites when stable, ? SBP
   - PPI drip
   - Octreotide
   - [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 4398**] next step if needed.
   - Follow ionized calcium
   # Elevated Lactate: Likely secondary to necrosis in the context of
   hypotension.  ? Mesenteric ischemia versus global hyperperfusion at
   this time.
   - Surgery consulted
   - Volume resuscitation with fluids, blood
   - No free air on CXR although not ideal.
   - Patient unstable for further evaluation of bowel at this time.
   # Anuria: Likely secondary to hypotension.  Renal consult obtained if
   patient needs urgent dialysis given hyperkalemia.  At this point given
   bleeding I am not sure if he would be stable for any CRRT.
   - Follow volume status
   - Follow potassium
   # Hyperkalemia: Resuscitation with temporizing measures as in HPI.
   Repeat K is elevated.  Renal aware.  Repeat:
   - Calcium gluconate
   - Sodium bicarbonate
   - Glucose/Insulin
   - follow serial K

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. The patient presented with sepsis and severe organ dysfunction, including metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, bleeding, anuria, hyperkalemia, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/57 mmHg to 131/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate levels. Blood cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) were initiated. The patient received blood transfusions and fresh frozen plasma (FFPs) due to significant blood loss. Liver at the bedside performed an endoscopy, and peritoneal fluid was tapped to evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient is receiving supportive care including vasopressor"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He was admitted with complaints of variceal bleeding and subsequently required endoscopy, invasive ventilation, and multi-lumen placement. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, elevated lactate, anuria, and hyperkalemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.

2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient's ascites and immunocompromised state increase the risk of SBP, which can lead to fever, abdominal pain, and signs of sepsis.

3. Hepato-renal syndrome: The combination of liver dysfunction and renal failure may progress to hepatorenal syndrome, resulting in worsening renal function.

4. Hepatic hydrothorax: The patient's cirrhosis increases the risk of hepatic hydrothorax, a condition where fluid accumulates in the pleural space, leading to shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

5. Esophageal variceal bleeding: The patient's history of variceal bleeding suggests a risk of recurrent bleeding episodes, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented to the ICU with sepsis, severe metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and signs of bleeding. He has been on mechanical ventilation and has undergone an endoscopy that revealed variceal bleeding. The patient's condition has been unstable, with elevated lactate levels indicating possible necrosis or global hyperperfusion. He has also experienced anuria, likely due to hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Renal consultation has been obtained, and the patient is currently receiving supportive care, including fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, and medication to manage electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation suggests sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is experiencing severe metabolic acidosis, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
3. Hypotension/Bleeding: The patient's low blood pressure and bleeding may indicate a component of volume loss, potentially contributing to his unstable condition.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis suggests potential liver dysfunction, which can complicate the management of his current condition.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's anuria indicates a possible renal dysfunction, which may require urgent dialysis due to hyperkalemia.

   # Hypotension/Bleed: Clearly there is a component of volume loss given
   his blood loss, unclear if there is sepsis.  EGD showed variceal bleed
   requiring multiple transfusions of PRBC for falling Hct.
   - Goal INR <2; goal plt >50; goal finbrinogen >100
   - q6h coags, calcium, cbc, electrolytes
   - 3 units PRBC for falling Hct; maintain Hct >28
   - 2 units FFP for INR 2.3
   - Continue Levophed; Vasopressin weaned off
   - Maintain active type and cross x8 units
   - PPI drip
   - Continue Octreotide
   - f/u cultures obtained
   - Tap ascites when stable, ? SBP

   - Volume resuscitation with fluids, blood
   - No free air on CXR although not ideal.
   - Patient unstable for further evaluation of bowel at this time.
   # Anuria: Likely secondary to hypotension.  Renal consult obtained if
   patient needs urgent dialysis given hyperkalemia.  At this point given
   bleeding I am not sure if he would be stable for any CRRT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and has been experiencing multiple complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypotension/Bleed: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to blood loss from variceal bleeding. This can lead to further complications such as shock and organ failure.

2. Acidosis, Metabolic: The patient is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, which is indicated by elevated lactate levels. This could be secondary to tissue hypoperfusion and necrosis.

3. Elevated LFTs/Lactate: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and lactate levels are also high. These abnormalities may be due to hepatic necrosis in the context of hypotension. There is a possibility of mesenteric ischemia or global hypoperfusion.

4. Anuria: The patient has been experiencing anuria, which is likely secondary to hypotension. Renal consult has been obtained if the patient requires urgent dialysis due to hyperkalemia.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is a high level of potassium in the blood. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate attention. Temporizing measures such as calcium gluconate,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who is currently in the MICU for hypovolemic shock due to a sudden variceal bleed. He has also developed respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been stable overnight, but he still requires two pressors to maintain hemodynamics. His lactate levels are improving, and he is now on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with better management of acidosis and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic shock/GI bleed/Blood loss anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is drifting down again, indicating ongoing blood loss. The goal is to transfuse and maintain an Hct of 28. Banding of varices has been performed, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has been given to correct the elevated INR. The patient also has high liver function test (LFT) elevations likely due to shock liver, and calcium repletion is needed.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with adequate management of acidosis and hyperkalemia.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's current ventilator settings are being continued.

Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, metabolic acidosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices, which required multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and banding during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD). The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. His vital signs show a low respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The ABG results indicate a slightly lower pH level of 7.32, suggesting a mild respiratory acidosis. However, there are no signs of severe ARDS based on the provided information.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Other (GI Bleed, GIB): The patient had an active variceal bleed that required multiple transfusions and banding during EGD. Although the bleeding seems to have been controlled, the patient is at risk for rebleeding and ongoing blood loss.

3. Hepatitis, Ischemic (Shock Liver): The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and elevated lactate levels, suggesting possible liver damage due to hypotension and shock. Ischemic hepatitis or ""shock liver"" can occur when there is inadequate blood flow"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute gastrointestinal bleed, ischemic hepatitis, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis. The patient also has metabolic acidosis.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension and bleeding, which required multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for falling hematocrit (Hct). The goal INR is less than 2, platelet count greater than 50, and fibrinogen level greater than 100.

The elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate levels are likely secondary to necrosis in the context of hypotension. There is a concern for mesenteric ischemia versus global hypoperfusion, but no free air on chest X-ray.

The patient has been anuric likely due to hypotension. A renal consult has been obtained, and urgent dialysis is being considered given hyperkalemia. The patient has received temporizing measures for hyperkalemia, and it is now resolved.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 82 bpm with a range of 63-83 bpm, blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 18-23 breaths per"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU. He is experiencing hypovolemic shock, gastrointestinal bleed, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis. The patient's condition has been stable overnight, but he remains critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic Shock/GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient may continue to experience low blood volume and require pressors to maintain blood pressure. There is a risk of further bleeding and development of anemia.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to manage his kidney function and electrolyte imbalances. Complications such as fluid overload or worsening renal function can occur.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his compromised immune system and ongoing infections. Infection control measures should be in place to prevent further infections.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and confusion.
6. Hepatitis: The patient may develop hepatitis due to liver dysfunction or complications related to sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute gastrointestinal bleed, ischemic hepatitis, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis. The patient has experienced hypotension and blood loss, leading to multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and stabilization of hematocrit (Hct) at 30. His lactic acid levels are improving. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate levels are elevated, indicating potential necrosis or global hypoperfusion. There are concerns about mesenteric ischemia versus global hypoperfusion. The patient's urine output has been very low (anuria), likely due to hypotension. Renal consult has been obtained for urgent dialysis considering hyperkalemia. The patient has been resuscitated with fluids and blood, and is currently receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). Electrolytes are being monitored every 6 hours, and temporizing measures have been taken to address hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which indicates severe respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has experienced active variceal bleeding"

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presented with respiratory failure, acute gastrointestinal bleed, ischemic hepatitis (shock liver), acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient also has metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/51 to 121/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals mottled appearance to feet bilaterally, distended abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.

The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, bleeding, elevated lactate levels, anuria, hyperkalemia, and respiratory failure. He has received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells, vasopressor support, and has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding to control active variceal bleeding.

The patient's goals of care include maintaining an INR below 2, platelet count above 50,000/mm3, fibrinogen level above 100 mg/dL, and hematocrit"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with cirrhosis who is in the MICU for hypovolemic shock and a sudden variceal bleed. He has developed respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient remains on levophed with increased requirements and is currently on CRRT due to acute renal failure. The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with current ventilator settings.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Hypovolemic shock/GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's hypovolemic shock and ongoing blood loss may lead to further deterioration in hemodynamic stability and potentially worsen his respiratory failure and renal function.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could progress if not appropriately managed, leading to further fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a decrease in oxygenation or an increase in carbon dioxide levels. This could be due to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening of underlying lung pathology.
4. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis could progress, leading to multiorgan failure and a higher risk of mortality.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis could worsen if there is inadequate tissue perfusion or ongoing lactic acid production.

Overall, close monitoring and prompt intervention are crucial to manage these potential"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with several acute conditions including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, ischemic hepatitis, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension (BP: 100/57 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR: 89 bpm). The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 500 mL, RR set at 20, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a RSBI deferred due to hemodynamic instability. The patient's blood gases show an ABG pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 32, HCO3- of 98, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 16.5 K/uL, decreased platelet count (Plt) at 32 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels (Total/Direct), and abnormal renal function tests (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen).

The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding of active variceal bleeding. The patient has received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presented with respiratory failure, acute gastrointestinal bleed, ischemic hepatitis, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis. The patient has been treated with multiple transfusions for active variceal bleeding, banding of the bleeding varices, and aggressive fluid resuscitation. His current vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. The patient has stable hemoglobin levels but elevated lactate levels. He is on vasopressor and inotropic support. His renal function is impaired, and he has hyperkalemia that has been managed with temporary measures. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of variceal bleeding increases the risk of further gastrointestinal bleeding or rebleeding.
3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver function may continue to deteriorate due to ischemic hepatitis or other underlying liver diseases.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
5. Sepsis: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient's sepsis"

   69 yo man with cirrhosis in MICU with hypovolemic shock in setting of
   sudden variceal bleed, leading to respiratory failure and acute renal
   failure.  Has showed little improvement since initial stabilization on
   the first MICU day - his prognosis is very poor.  He is now having
   significant ectopy as well.  We are meeting with his estranged
   children, his cousin, and his friend [**Name (NI) 4396**] today to discuss his poor
   prognosis.  Based on our previous conversations, CMO care would be
   warrented at this point.
   1. Hypovolemic shock/GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: Continue to elevated
   lavtate.  Has persistent pressor requirement.
   2. Acute renal failure: On hold for the moment
   3. Respiratory Failure: Cont current vent settings.
   Remainder of issues per ICU team.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis who is currently in the MICU. He presented with hypovolemic shock secondary to a sudden variceal bleed, leading to respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient has shown little improvement since initial stabilization and has a very poor prognosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's persistent pressor requirement indicates ongoing hypotension, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction and poor tissue perfusion.

2. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The sudden variceal bleed has resulted in significant blood loss, leading to anemia. Continued bleeding can lead to further blood loss and potential re-bleeding episodes.

3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and immobility. Adequate lung secretion clearance and appropriate infection control measures should be implemented.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by elevated serum lactate levels and abnormal kidney function tests. Prolonged hypotension and inadequate perfusion may worsen renal function, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI).

5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG results indicate a low pH level"
