 CHEST PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. pt has CRI and in the setting of
   this his 2 sets of trop has been in the indetermined range with a
   negative ck. this makes an ACS scenario with unstable plaque rupture
   much less likely. he may have stable coronary artery disease with
   demand ischemia at times. We need to obtain his recent cardiac cath
   report from [**Hospital **] to help determine further the extend and amenability
   of it to revascularization. he also has severe AS and although we can
   present his case to the CT surgery i'd imagine he's perhaps not the
   best candidate. short of that we could entertain valvuloplasty as an
   alternative choice of therapy. his language barrier certainly makes it
   challenging in determine whether his symptoms are related to his AS.
   his echo called this severe as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however
   the peak gradient is 39 and mean gradient is 20. whether this is
   secondary to a low output state due to his poor lv function vs genuine
   severe as is unclear at present. i think we have several priorities
   here. 1) optimize medical therapy for his cad and cardiac dysfunction.
   2) further evaluation of ongoing bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further
   evaluation of his coronary anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of
   AS.
   - i don't believe this gentleman is having an ACS and will not
   anticoagulate him at this point. Will continue home regimen of aspirin,
   zocor, lisinopril and metoprolol. his blood pressure and hr are in the
   lower range of normal where it should be.
   - from his lv dysfunction point of view he appears fairly well
   compensated. will continue chf meds of ace-i, beta blocker and standing
   dose lasix.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.
   .
   #) Pulmonary:
   - pt has mild pan expiratory wheeze. cxr suggestive of pneumonia but
   he's afebrile with a normal wcc.
   - will d/c abx and follow along clinically.
   .
   #) GI:
   - pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in his
   stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.
   - serial hct check
   - iv ppi
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:
   - no clot at present. per wife this also started recently. no evidence
   of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.
   - maybe foley trauma related during recent admission.
   - follow conservatively for now.
   .
   #) Anemia:
   - mcv 90. will do anemia eval.
   - type and screen.
   .
   #) CRI:
   - at baseline.
   .
   #) DM:
   - outpatient lantus dose and sliding scale.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - ppi and pneumoboots.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with complex medical issues who presented from a nursing facility after taking NTG for chest pain, resulting in hypotension that resolved spontaneously. The patient has been diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and unstable angina/NSTEMI. However, the troponin levels are in the indeterminate range, and the CK is negative, making an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) scenario with unstable plaque rupture less likely. Instead, the patient may have stable coronary artery disease with demand ischemia at times. 

The patient's recent cardiac catheterization report is needed to determine the extent and amenability of the coronary artery disease to revascularization. Additionally, the patient has severe AS, but he may not be the best candidate for cardiac surgery. Valvuloplasty could be an alternative choice of therapy. The patient's language barrier makes it challenging to determine whether his symptoms are related to AS. His echocardiogram showed a valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2, but the peak gradient is 39 and mean gradient is 20, which is unclear if it is secondary to low output state due to poor left ventricular function or genuine severe AS.

The patient's priorities include optimizing medical therapy for his coronary artery disease and cardiac dysfunction, further evaluation of ongoing bloody stool and hematuria, and further evaluation of his coronary anatomy, coronary ischemia, and severity of AS.

 CHEST PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. Mildly elevated trop and flat CK
   in setting of CRI. Unlikely active ACS this makes an ACS scenario with
   unstable plaque rupture much less likely. he may have stable coronary
   artery disease with demand ischemia at times.  ECHO called this severe
   as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however the peak gradient is 39 and
   mean gradient is 20. whether this is secondary to a low output state
   due to his poor lv function vs genuine severe as is unclear at present.
   i think we have several priorities here. 1) optimize medical therapy
   for his cad and cardiac dysfunction. 2) further evaluation of ongoing
   bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further evaluation of his coronary
   anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of AS.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.
   - discuss case with CT surgery
   - cont statin, lisinopril , metprolol, spironolactone
   - cont lasix 40mg po standing
   - decr ASA to 81

   #) Pulmonary: ?retrocardiac opacity
   - will check PA/Lat
   - will d/c abx and follow along clinically.

   #) GI:pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in
   his stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.
   - serial hct check
   - iv ppi
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:no clot at present. per wife this also started recently.
   no evidence of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.
   - maybe foley trauma related during recent admission.
   - follow conservatively for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with complex medical issues who presented to the ICU after taking nitroglycerin for chest pain, resulting in hypotension. He has a history of unstable angina/NSTEMI, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and other cardiac dysfunction. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/56 mmHg to 131/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals mild elevation in jugular venous pressure (JVP), reduced air entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze, and a faint systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space with radiation to the neck. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose level, mildly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated troponin T level. The patient's chest pain is currently resolved, and he is not showing signs of active acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, further evaluation is needed for ongoing bloody stool and hematuria. The patient requires optimization of medical therapy for his coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiac dysfunction. He also requires further evaluation of his coronary anatomy, coronary ischemia, and severity of AS. A recent catheterization report is pending, and there will be"

The patient is an 83-year-old man with complex medical issues, including severe aortic stenosis (AS), decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%, and severe coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the ICU after taking nitroglycerin (NTG) for chest pain, which resulted in hypotension that resolved spontaneously. The patient is currently chest pain-free but has mildly elevated troponin levels and flat CK in the setting of cardiogenic shock (CRI).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 67 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 105/56 mmHg to 131/68 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 37.3°C (99.2°F), and his current temperature is 35.8°C (96.5°F).

Physical examination reveals mild jugular venous distention (JVD) with a 30% angle, a regular rate and rhythm (RRR), faint S2, and an ejection systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space with radiation to the neck. There is reduced air entry bilaterally with expiratory wheezes on lung auscultation.

   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: 3VD on recent cath LAD TO, LCx 50%, RCA 60% medical therapy
   vs surgical option vs interventional options. Very possible that severe
   AS contributing to recent CP.
   - discuss case with CT surgery
   - cont statin, lisinopril , metprolol, spironolactone
   - cont lasix 40mg po standing
   - decr ASA to 81
   - recheck EKG
   - avoid NTG with AS.
   # AS
 moderate dz, no delay in carotid upstoke, but loss of A2 . Echo
   called this severe as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. As noted above,
   AVR + CABG may be reasonable.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with complex medical issues who presented from a nursing facility after taking nitroglycerin (NTG) for chest pain, resulting in hypotension that resolved spontaneously. He has a history of chest pain secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI and severe aortic stenosis (AS). Recent cardiac catheterization showed triple vessel disease with left anterior descending artery thrombosis, left circumflex artery 50% stenosis, and right coronary artery 60% stenosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with mild elevation in jugular venous pressure (JVP) and 1+ delayed pulses. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin T levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac: The patient has severe AS and triple vessel disease. There is a possibility of recurrent unstable angina or myocardial infarction. The patient needs further evaluation to determine if surgical intervention (AVR + CABG) or medical management is appropriate.
2. Pulmonary: The presence of a possible retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray is concerning for pneumonia. However, the patient is currently afebrile and without any signs of infection. Close clinical monitoring is recommended.
3. GI: The patient's wife reports streaked stool, but no history of upper endoscopy. It is unclear if he is up-to-date with screening for gastrointestinal"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man with complex medical issues who presented from a nursing facility after taking NTG for chest pain, resulting in hypotension that resolved spontaneously. The patient has a history of chest pain secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI or severe aortic stenosis (AS). 

The patient's current condition includes:
- 3VD (three vessel disease) with the left anterior descending artery (LAD) being totally occluded, the left circumflex artery (LCx) having 50% stenosis, and the right coronary artery (RCA) having 60% stenosis. 
- Moderate aortic valve disease with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm2 and peak/mean gradients of 39/20 mmHg, respectively.
- Possible retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, but without fever or elevated white blood cell count, so no antibiotics have been given.
- Decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, which are stable overnight.
- Blood streaks in stool since admission, but no further evaluation has been done.
- Hematuria, possibly related to recent Foley trauma during a previous admission.
- Mild iron deficiency anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on these findings include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition includes severe AS and significant coronary artery disease. These conditions can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease and previous cardiac catheterization. The patient's current catheterization showed clean left main coronary artery (LMCA) and mild-to-moderate stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), circumflex artery (LCx), and right coronary artery (RCA). The patient has been on aspirin (ASA) at a reduced dose of 81 mg and has been started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). There is a possible retrocardiac opacity seen on chest X-ray, but the patient is currently afebrile and no antibiotics have been given.

The patient has allergies to phenylephrine and has had no recent antibiotics. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the addition of chest pain. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 99/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen support.

Physical examination reveals a patient in no apparent distress, with appropriate mood and affect. The patient has no conjunctival pallor or cyanosis and has supple neck veins with mildly elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). Cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm with a faint S2"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. Mildly elevated trop and flat CK
   in setting of CRI. Unlikely active ACS this makes an ACS scenario with
   unstable plaque rupture much less likely. he may have stable coronary
   artery disease with demand ischemia at times.  ECHO called this severe
   as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however the peak gradient is 39 and
   mean gradient is 20. whether this is secondary to a low output state
   due to his poor lv function vs genuine severe as is unclear at present.
   i think we have several priorities here. 1) optimize medical therapy
   for his cad and cardiac dysfunction. 2) further evaluation of ongoing
   bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further evaluation of his coronary
   anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of AS.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.
   - discuss case with CT surgery
   - cont statin, lisinopril , metprolol, spironolactone
   - cont lasix 40mg po standing
   - decr ASA to 81
   .
   #) Pulmonary: ?retrocardiac opacity
   - will check PA/Lat
   - will d/c abx and follow along clinically.
   .
   #) GI:pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in
   his stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.
   - serial hct check
   - iv ppi
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:no clot at present. per wife this also started recently.
   no evidence of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.
   - maybe foley trauma related during recent admission.
   - follow conservatively for now.
   - consult urology consult.
   #) Anemia: Mild iron deficiency.
   - Begin ferrous sulfate 325mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and screen.
   .
   #) CRI:
   - at baseline.
   .
   #) DM:
   - outpatient lantus dose and sliding scale.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - ppi and pneumoboots.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old man with complex medical issues who presented to the ICU after taking nitroglycerin for chest pain, resulting in hypotension that resolved spontaneously. He has a history of chest pain secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI or severe aortic stenosis (AS), but it is unclear which is the primary cause. The patient's current condition includes mildly elevated troponin and flat CK in the setting of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). It is unlikely that he is experiencing active acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with plaque rupture, making a scenario of unstable plaque rupture less likely. Instead, he may have stable coronary artery disease with demand ischemia at times.

The patient's recent echocardiogram showed severe AS with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm^2, but the peak gradient is 39 and mean gradient is 20, which could be secondary to a low output state due to his poor left ventricular function or genuine severe AS. The priorities for the patient's care include optimizing medical therapy for his coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiac dysfunction, further evaluation of ongoing bloody stool and hematuria, and further evaluation of his coronary anatomy, ischemia, and severity of AS.

The patient's medical therapy will be continued, including statin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and spironolactone. The dose of aspirin will be decreased to 81 mg. Lasix"
