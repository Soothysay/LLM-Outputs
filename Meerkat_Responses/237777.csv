   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   80[**Hospital **] nursing home resident admitted with hypotension, confusion,
   bradycardia.  She has a history of DM, frequent UTI, dementia;
   yesterday found to be somnolent and unresponsive (at baseline alert,
   conversant, agitated).  She was bradycardic with HR 30-40's and
   subsequent hypotension with SBP 70's.  Started on peripheral dopamine
   and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**].
   24 Hour Events:
   Admitted overnight; dosed with glucagon IV with improvement in HR but
   no change in BP.  Attempts to wean dopamine met with worsened
   hypotension.  Central line and arterial line placed; switched from
   dopamine to levophed/vasopressin.  Had worsening mental status with
   concern for protecting her airway so she was intubated.  Pressor
   requirement increased after intubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   80yoF with dementia, h/o UTIs, DM; admitted with confusion and
   subsequent hypotension in setting of UTI and likely urosepsis.
   1.  Hypotension secondary to sepsis:  Suspect urinary source. Lactate
   normal; normal CvO2. Awaiting repeat CVP.
   -  Plan fluid bolus x 1L and reassess urine output, pressor
   requirement, CVP.
   - Continue levophed/vasopressin; wean levophed as tolerated
   - treatment of infectious processes as below
   - If BP not improving with fluids, can consider cortisol stimulation
   test
   2.  ID:  History of resistant gram-negative urinary tract infection,
   currently vancomycin and cefepime
   -   Given likelyhood of UTI and possible GN bacteremia; will add
   gentamicin once daily dosing while awaiting culture data
   - continue cefipime for resistant gram-negatives
   - Vancomycin with possibility of MRSA and concern for HCAP
   3.  Sinus Bradycardia:  no clear etiology, was on metoprolol at
   baseline.  Cardiac markers negative so far; EKG without ischemia.
   - continue levophed for time being
   - Await additional cardiac markers, but doubt ischemic etiology
   - TTE
   4.  Respiratory Failure:
   - awaiting repeat ABG
   - Can trial change to pressure support and minimize sedation
   - Hope to SBT tomorrow if hemodynamics improving.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, confusion, and bradycardia. The patient's initial presentation included somnolence and unresponsiveness, which worsened over time.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 72 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 99/49 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) of 83%, and temperature (T) of 35.6Â°C. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 172 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin T of <0.01 ng/mL, blood glucose of 89 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.3 mmol/L. The patient's urine output is 170 mL, and she is receiving IV fluids totaling 2,408 mL since midnight.

The patient has been treated with various medications including norepinephrine, vasopressin, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, heparin prophylaxis, vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. The patient's medical history includes resistant gram-negative UTIs, diabetes mellitus, and dementia.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient is suspected to have a urinary source of infection leading to urosepsis. Her lactate levels are normal, and CvO2 is within normal range. A repeat CVP is pending. The plan includes a fluid bolus of 1L and reassessment of urine output, pressor requirement, and CVP. Levophed/vasopressin will be continued, with an attempt to wean levophed as tolerated. Treatment for infectious processes will be administered as below.
2. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of resistant gram-negative UTIs and is currently on van"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes, and frequent urinary tract infections.
- She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, confusion, and bradycardia.
- The patient had a baseline alert and conversant status but became somnolent and unresponsive.
- She required intubation for airway protection and pressor support due to worsening hypotension.
- The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected urosepsis.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and normal lactate levels.
- Imaging and microbiology tests are pending.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient's hypotension may worsen if the infection is not adequately controlled or if there is a resistant organism causing the urinary tract infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status could deteriorate further if there is a progression of pneumonia or if weaning from mechanical ventilation becomes difficult.
3. Sinus bradycardia: The bradycardia could potentially progress to heart block or worsen if the underlying cause is not identified and addressed.
4. Infection control: There is a risk of healthcare-associated infections due to the patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.
5. Pressure injuries: Immobility and prolonged bed rest"

   80yoF with dementia, h/o UTIs, DM; admitted with confusion and
   subsequent hypotension in setting of UTI and likely urosepsis.
   1.  Hypotension secondary to sepsis:  Suspect urinary source. Lactate
   normal; normal CvO2. Awaiting repeat CVP.
   -  Plan fluid bolus x 1L and reassess urine output, pressor
   requirement, CVP.
   - Continue levophed/vasopressin; wean levophed as tolerated
   - treatment of infectious processes as below
   - If BP not improving with fluids, can consider cortisol stimulation
   test
   2.  ID:  History of resistant gram-negative urinary tract infection,
   currently vancomycin and cefepime
   -   Given likelyhood of UTI and possible GN bacteremia; will add
   gentamicin once daily dosing while awaiting culture data
   - continue cefipime for resistant gram-negatives
   - Vancomycin with possibility of MRSA and concern for HCAP
   3.  Sinus Bradycardia:  no clear etiology, was on metoprolol at
   baseline.  Cardiac markers negative so far; EKG without ischemia.
   - continue levophed for time being
   - Await additional cardiac markers, but doubt ischemic etiology
   - TTE
   4.  Respiratory Failure:
   - awaiting repeat ABG
   - Can trial change to pressure support and minimize sedation
   - Hope to SBT tomorrow if hemodynamics improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and dementia. She was admitted with hypotension, confusion, and bradycardia. The patient's condition worsened, resulting in somnolence and unresponsiveness. She required intubation due to airway protection concerns. The patient has been receiving various pressors, including dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin, to manage her hypotension. She also received glucagon IV with improvement in heart rate but no change in blood pressure. The patient's lactate level is normal, and her mixed venous oxygen saturation is 83%. She has been receiving antibiotics for a suspected urinary source of infection, and blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient's persistent hypotension suggests ongoing sepsis, likely originating from the urinary tract. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's history of frequent UTIs and current symptoms indicate that the UTI may have progressed to urosepsis. If left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of the body and cause further complications.
3. Respiratory failure: Due to the patient's intubation, she is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing"

   bradycardia.  She has a history of DM, frequent UTI, dementia;
   yesterday found to be somnolent and unresponsive (at baseline alert,
   conversant, agitated).  She was bradycardic with HR 30-40's and
   subsequent hypotension with SBP 70's.  Started on peripheral dopamine
   and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**].
   24 Hour Events:
   Admitted overnight; dosed with glucagon IV with improvement in HR but
   no change in BP.  Attempts to wean dopamine met with worsened
   hypotension.  Central line and arterial line placed; switched from
   dopamine to levophed/vasopressin.  Had worsening mental status with
   concern for protecting her airway so she was intubated.  Pressor

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes, and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, confusion, and bradycardia. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to somnolence, unresponsiveness, and worsening mental status. She required intubation for airway protection and increased pressor requirements. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient is suspected to have a urinary source of infection. Lactate levels are normal, and central venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) is also normal. A repeat central venous pressure (CVP) is pending. The plan includes fluid bolus, reassessment of urine output, pressor requirement, and CVP. Levophed/vasopressin will be continued, and levophed will be weaned as tolerated. Treatment for infectious processes will be initiated.
2. Infectious disease (ID): The patient has a history of resistant gram-negative UTI and is currently on vancomycin and cefepime. Gentamicin once daily dosing will be added while awaiting culture data. Cefepime will be continued for resistant gram-negatives, and vancomycin will be continued with the possibility of MRSA and concern for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

   2.  ID:  History of resistant gram-negative urinary tract infection,
   currently vancomycin and cefepime
   -   Given likelyhood of UTI and possible GN bacteremia; will add
   gentamicin once daily dosing while awaiting finalization of culture

   - continue cefipime for resistant gram-negatives
   - Vancomycin with possibility of MRSA and concern for HCAP
   3.  Sinus Bradycardia:  no clear etiology, was on metoprolol at
   baseline.  Cardiac markers negative so far; EKG without ischemia.
   - continue levophed for time being
   - Await additional cardiac markers, but doubt ischemic etiology

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, urinary tract infections, and diabetes who was admitted with confusion and subsequent hypotension in the setting of a urinary tract infection and likely urosepsis. The patient's condition has been complex and has required multiple interventions.

1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient's hypotension is suspected to be due to sepsis, possibly with a urinary source. However, rising liver function tests (LFTs) and right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness may indicate a hepatic or cholecystic source. The patient's urine output (UOP) is improving, and leukocytosis is likely worsening due to the administration of steroids.

2. Infectious Disease (ID): The patient has a history of resistant gram-negative urinary tract infection and is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. It is planned to add gentamicin once daily dosing while awaiting finalization of culture data. Cefepime will continue for resistant gram-negatives, and vancomycin will be used with the possibility of MRSA and concern for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

3. Sinus Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing sinus bradycardia, but no clear etiology has been identified. The patient was on metoprolol at baseline, and cardiac markers are negative so far. The electrocardiogram (EKG)"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with dementia and a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted with confusion and subsequent hypotension in the setting of a UTI and likely urosepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/46-130/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

   Assessment and Plan
   80F  NH resident with DM, dementia, freq UTIs presents with sepsis and
   respiratory failure likely  from UTI
   Issues include:
          Sepsis
          hypotension
          respiratory failure
          NGMA
          ARF
          bradycardia
          elevated LFTs
          Thrombocytopenia
   UTI most likely source. Providencia growing from OSH ucx sensitive to
   cefepime.  Remains on 2 pressors with increasing leukocytosis despite
   appropriate antbx coverage.  Svo2 high and lactate normalized
   suggesting adequate flow, microcirculation and O2 extraction.  There is
   no evidence of renal abscess per CT read. Looking also for alternative
   sources including lung, skin, osteo or inflammatory process from
   sepsis.
   Agree with plan to continue broad antibx--vanco, cefepime . In setting
   of further clinical decline change to [**Last Name (un) **]/vanco
   Trend lactate as is at risk for [**Last Name (un) 6584**] ischemi given pressors.  F/u
   pending cx data, stool for c diff, RUQ ultrasound to eval for liver
   source, wound care c/s for R heal ulcer.  Follow plts and send DIC
   panel. Maintain CVP goal [**11-6**] and continue levophed/vasopressin; wean
   levophed as tolerated. Getting stress steroids for relative adrenal
   insuff.
   In terms of vent, secretions and metabolic acidosis limit ability to
   wean, high likelihood of fatiguing. Follow abgs, continue acv for now.
   NGMA is likely from sepsis and nl saline resus.  Use LR boluses as
   needed though at this time appears adequately fluid resuscitated.
   Remains in sinus brady.  Unclear if [**2-27**] levophed verses conduction
   issue verses sepsis.  Wean levophed as able, consider change to
   dopamine, atropine at bedside, as long as maintained above 50 do not
   feel need for pacing
   Suspect ARF is [**2-27**]  atn from hypotension and sepsis.  Will send urine
   lytes, avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds, stop gent, monitor urine
   outpt, no acute HD requirement at this moment
   [**Name2 (NI) 767**] transaminitis, likely [**2-27**] hypotension/sepsis, will check ruq us
   and ggt.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with diabetes and dementia who presented with fevers, confusion, hypotension, and a positive urinalysis consistent with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient remains intubated and on two pressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine) for support. Her urine output is low, and she has a possible perinephric abscess identified on ultrasound.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 100/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is within normal range.

The patient has elevated leukocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and acute kidney injury (ARF). Imaging studies reveal no evidence of renal abscess, but there is atelectasis/infiltrate possibly due to aspiration.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis, hypotension, respiratory failure, non-gastrointestinal motility abnormality (NGMA), ARF, bradycardia, elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with dementia and a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), diabetes mellitus (DM), and respiratory failure. She was admitted with fevers, confusion, hypotension, and positive urine analysis consistent with sepsis due to a UTI.

The patient remains on two pressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine) but is slowly weaning off levophed. Her urine output remains low without response to fluids. She remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support system.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius (98.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 182.3 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.2 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 137 mg/dL, low hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L. The results also indicate"

   1.  Hypotension secondary to sepsis:  Suspect urinary source, but
   rising LFTs and RUQ tenderness may indicate hepatic/cholecystic source
   but urosepsis. LFTs improving. UOP improving. Leukocytosis improving
   -RUQ U/S with GB thickening but surgery does not overtly suspect
   cholecystitis, if not improving consider perc drain
   - Continue levophed/vasopressin; wean levophed as tolerated
   - treatment of infectious processes as below
   - stress dose steroids.
   2.  ID:  History of resistant gram-negative urinary tract infection,
   currently vancomycin and cefepime, growing providencia stuartii, [**Last Name (un) 206**]
   to cefepime at OSH.
   -   Given likelyhood of UTI and possible GN bacteremia;
   - continue cefipime for resistant gram-negatives
   - Vancomycin with possibility of MRSA and concern for HCAP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely due to initial hypotensive episode
   causing ATN,
   -Renally dose meds
   -Con
t to monitor, maintain euvolemia
   # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Elevated PTT and rapid drop in both cell

   also a possibility given likely recent exposure but would not account
   for HCT drop.
   -Stat fibrinogen, hemolysis labs, peripheral smear
   -Transfuse cryo for fib<100, platlets, FFP, and blood as needed
   -Follow coags, fibrinogen, and CBC
   3.  Sinus Bradycardia:  no clear etiology, was on metoprolol at
   baseline.  Cardiac markers negative so far; EKG without
   ischemia.
   - continue levophed for time being
   - Await additional cardiac markers, but doubt ischemic etiology
   - TTE with reduced global function but no focal WMA
   4.  Respiratory Failure: RSBI too high today and MS not improved.
   Possibly complicated by Ativan being received for ketamine study

   - Can trial change to pressure support and minimize sedation
   - Hope to SBT tomorrow if hemodynamics improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infections. She was admitted with confusion and subsequent hypotension, likely due to urosepsis. The patient's current condition includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension secondary to sepsis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's initial hypotensive episode may have caused acute tubular necrosis (ATN), leading to renal failure. This is supported by the elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
3. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low hematocrit (HCT) and platelet count suggest anemia and thrombocytopenia. These findings are concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), although there are no signs of hemolysis on current labs.
4. Sinus Bradycardia: The patient has a slow heart rate (bradycardia), which may have an unclear etiology. It could be related to the use of metoprolol or another medication.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, dementia, and a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She presents with sepsis and respiratory failure likely due to a UTI. The patient has several medical complications and potential medical issues that could arise.

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is failing, as indicated by her need for mechanical ventilation and endotracheal tube insertion. This could be a result of pneumonia or aspiration.

3. UTI: The patient's UTI appears to be the source of the sepsis. Providencia, a bacteria, has been growing in her urine culture and is sensitive to cefepime, an antibiotic she has been receiving.

4. Right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA): There is a concern for possible RLL pneumonia, which could be contributing to her respiratory failure.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a decreasing platelet count, indicating thrombocytopenia. This could be due to sepsis, coagulopathy, or another underlying cause.

6. Anemia and coagulopathy: The patient has a drop in hematocrit (Hct) and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old nursing home resident with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, dementia, and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The patient presents with sepsis and respiratory failure, likely due to a UTI. The patient's condition has been improving, with normalized lactate levels and high SVO2 suggesting adequate flow and oxygen extraction. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, which will be continued pending culture results. The patient also requires wound care for a right heel ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to the sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support (CPAP/PSV mode), and weaning off the ventilator will depend on their ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. UTI: The patient's frequent UTIs may have led to the current sepsis. It is essential to complete the antibiotic course and implement preventive measures to minimize the risk of future UTIs.

4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient shows signs of ARF, possibly secondary to hypotension and sepsis. It"

   -f/u HIT antibody
   -Transfuse cryo for fib<100, platlets, FFP, and blood as needed
   -Follow coags, fibrinogen, and CBC
    # Elevated PTT: Likely in setting of heparin, PTT normalized once
   heparin stopped. Factor VIII levels normal. No need for mixing study at

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia and diabetes who was admitted with confusion and subsequent hypotension in the setting of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and likely urosepsis. The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, with altered mental status, bradycardia, hypotension, and risk for aspiration. The patient's blood pressure remains stable on vasopressin, and she is receiving respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient's blood pressure remains stable on vasopressin, but there is a risk of ongoing hypotension due to sepsis.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension, and renal function is improving. Close monitoring of fluid balance and medication dosing based on renal function is essential.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which could be due to bone marrow suppression caused by infection. Regular monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation parameters is necessary.
4. Elevated PTT: The patient's prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) could be related to heparin therapy. Once heparin was stopped, the PTT normalized, and factor VIII levels were normal. Continued monitoring of coagulation parameters is required"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 BRADYCARDIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   80yoF with dementia, h/o UTIs, DM; admitted with confusion and
   subsequent hypotension in setting of UTI and likely urosepsis.
   1.  Hypotension secondary to sepsis:  Suspect urinary source, but
   rising LFTs and RUQ tenderness may indicate hepatic/cholecystic source
   but urosepsis. LFTs improving. UOP improving. Leukocytosis improving
   -RUQ U/S with GB thickening but surgery does not overtly suspect
   cholecystitis, if not improving consider perc drain
   - Continue levophed/vasopressin; wean levophed as tolerated
   - treatment of infectious processes as below
   - stress dose steroids.
   2.  ID:  History of resistant gram-negative urinary tract infection,
   currently vancomycin and cefepime, growing providencia stuartii, [**Last Name (un) 206**]
   to cefepime at OSH.
   -   Given likelyhood of UTI and possible GN bacteremia;
   - continue cefipime for resistant gram-negatives
   - Vancomycin with possibility of MRSA and concern for HCAP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely due to initial hypotensive episode
   causing ATN,
   -Renally dose meds
   -Con
t to monitor, maintain euvolemia
   # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Elevated PTT and rapid drop in both cell
   lines concerning for DIC. No signs of hemolysis on current labs. HIT
   also a possibility given likely recent exposure but would not account
   for HCT drop.
   -Stat fibrinogen, hemolysis labs, peripheral smear
   -Transfuse cryo for fib<100, platlets, FFP, and blood as needed
   -Follow coags, fibrinogen, and CBC
   3.  Sinus Bradycardia:  no clear etiology, was on metoprolol at
   baseline.  Cardiac markers negative so far; EKG without
   ischemia.
   - continue levophed for time being
   - Await additional cardiac markers, but doubt ischemic etiology
   - TTE with reduced global function but no focal WMA
   4.  Respiratory Failure: RSBI too high today and MS not improved.
   Possibly complicated by Ativan being received for ketamine study
   protocol.
   - Can trial change to pressure support and minimize sedation
   - Hope to SBT tomorrow if hemodynamics improving.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus, and multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted with confusion and subsequent hypotension in the setting of a UTI and likely urosepsis. The patient has altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: Suspect urinary source, but rising liver function tests (LFTs) and right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness may indicate hepatic/cholecystic source. LFTs improving. UOP improving. Leukocytosis improving - RUQ ultrasound with gallbladder thickening but surgery does not overtly suspect cholecystitis, if not improving consider percutaneous drain.
- Continue levophed/vasopressin; wean levophed as tolerated.
- Treatment of infectious processes as below.
- Stress dose steroids.

2. ID: History of resistant gram-negative urinary tract infection, currently vancomycin and cefepime, growing providencia stuartii, [Last Name (un) 206] to cefepime at OSH.
- Given likelihood of UTI and possible gram-negative bacteremia; continue cefepime for resistant gram-negatives.
- Vancomycin with possibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and concern for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

3. Acute renal failure: Likely due to initial hypotensive episode causing acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Renally dose medications.
- Continue to monitor and maintain euvolemia.

4. Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Elevated PTT and rapid drop in both cell lines concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). No signs of hemolysis on current labs. HIT also a possibility given likely recent exposure but would not account for HCT drop.
- Stat fibrinogen, hemolysis labs, peripheral smear.
- Transfuse cryo for fib <100, platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and blood as needed.
- Follow coags, fibrinogen, and CBC.

5. Sinus bradycardia: No clear etiology, was on metoprolol at baseline. Cardiac markers negative so far; EKG without ischemia.
- Continue levophed for the time being.
- Await additional cardiac markers, but doubt ischemic etiology.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with reduced global function but no focal wall motion abnormality (WMA).

6. Respiratory failure: Respiratory system compliance (RSBI) too high today and mask ventilation not improved.
- Can trial change to pressure support and minimize sedation.
- Hope to spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) tomorrow if hemodynamics improving.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: 
- Glycemic control:
- Lines: Multi-lumen arterial line inserted.
- Prophylaxis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   2.  ID:  History of resistant gram-negative urinary tract infection,
   currently vancomycin and cefepime, growing providencia stuartii, [**Last Name (un) 206**]
   to cefepime at OSH.
   -   Given likelyhood of UTI and possible GN bacteremia;
   - continue cefipime for resistant gram-negatives
   - Vancomycin with possibility of MRSA and concern for HCAP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely due to initial hypotensive episode
   causing ATN,
   -Renally dose meds
   -Con
t to monitor, maintain euvolemia
   # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Elevated PTT and rapid drop in both cell
   lines concerning for DIC. No signs of hemolysis on current labs. HIT
   also a possibility given likely recent exposure but would not account
   for HCT drop.
   -Stat fibrinogen, hemolysis labs, peripheral smear
   -Transfuse cryo for fib<100, platlets, FFP, and blood as needed
   -Follow coags, fibrinogen, and CBC
   3.  Sinus Bradycardia:  no clear etiology, was on metoprolol at
   baseline.  Cardiac markers negative so far; EKG without
   ischemia.
   - continue levophed for time being
   - Await additional cardiac markers, but doubt ischemic etiology
   - TTE with reduced global function but no focal WMA
   4.  Respiratory Failure: RSBI too high today and MS not improved.
   Possibly complicated by Ativan being received for ketamine study
   protocol.
   - Can trial change to pressure support and minimize sedation
   - Hope to SBT tomorrow if hemodynamics improving.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infections. She was admitted with confusion and subsequent hypotension, which is believed to be due to urosepsis. The patient has altered mental status, bradycardia, and respiratory failure. She is currently on vasopressin and levophed for blood pressure support. Her labs show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia. The urine culture indicates a resistant gram-negative bacterial infection, specifically Providentia stuartii. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's hypotension, altered mental status, and leukocytosis suggest sepsis. However, there is no evidence of organ dysfunction at this time.
2. Airway compromise: The patient's inability to protect her airway poses a risk for aspiration and altered gas exchange.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may require ongoing vasopressor support.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate may need further evaluation, especially since it is not explained by medications or cardiac ischemia.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria suggest possible acute kidney injury.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's low hemoglobin and platelet count require further investigation, including ruling out"

   Assessment and Plan
   80yoF with AMS, hypotension, respiratory failure in setting of
   urosepsis.
   1.       Urosepsis/UTI:
   - can discontinue vancomycin, change from cefipime to ceftriaxone given
   sensitivities
   - Overall her shock is improving, both sepsis, adrenal insufficiency
   possible explanations.
   - Continuing steroids as below.
   - Restart levophed and wean, d/c vasopressin.
   2.       Adrenal Insufficiency:]
   - continue hydrocortisone 50mg q8h; will consider wean after off
   pressors
   3.       Respiratory Failure due to altered mental status/aspiration:
   barriers to extubation 1) mental status, 2) secretions
   - SBT today
   - Aim for TBB negative 500ml to 1L today, diuresis if needed
   4.       Acute renal failure:  Likely septis induced injury/ATN
   - Urine output improving, cr improving.
   - Will consider diuresis today.
   5.       Thrombocytopenia/anemia:
   - HIT pending; off heparin
   - repeat HCT this afternoon; but no evidence of active bleeding

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with dementia and a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and progressed to hypotension and shock, likely due to urosepsis. The patient remains on vasopressin and has been extubated, but requires respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation. She has periods of apnea but improves with decreased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's head CT shows no acute processes.

The patient has been sedated and unable to provide history. Allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were gentamicin, cefepime, and vancomycin. The patient is currently receiving multiple infusions including vasopressin, lorazepam, insulin sliding scale, cefepime, chlorhexidine, and hydrocortisone. Other medications include colace, ASA, and chlorhexidine.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for respiratory failure. Flow sheet data shows vital signs with stable blood pressure and heart rate, decreased temperature, and increased respiratory rate. The patient's weight has increased since admission. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) within normal range, with adequate fluid balance. The patient is receiving oxygen through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

   - continue hydrocortisone 50mg q8h; will consider taper after off
   pressors
   3.       Respiratory Failure due to altered mental status/aspiration:
   barriers to extubation 1) mental status, 2) secretions
   - SBT today
   - Allow for auto-diuresis, can consider lasix if needed to maintain

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, who was admitted for altered mental status and progressed to hypotension, shock, and respiratory failure. She has likely urosepsis, as indicated by urine culture results showing Providencia stuartii (a gram-negative rod). The patient is currently on vasopressin and off levophed. She experiences periods of apnea but improves with decreased pressure support ventilation (PSV). Her head CT is clear of acute processes, and she has thin frothy secretions. 

The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. She has no known drug allergies. She received antibiotics (gentamicin, cefipime, and vancomycin) at different times. The patient is on multiple medications, including vasopressin, lorazepam, colace, insulin sliding scale, cefipime, chlorhexidine, hydrocortisone, and ASA.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. Her weight has increased from admission. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) within normal range, positive fluid balance, and negative urine output balance. She is on CPAP/PSV with an endotracheal tube, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 97. Her blood gases show respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia. 

Her physical examination reveals clear chest with crackles, regular rapid respirations, and lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid, as well as low albumin, potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels. Imaging shows an abnormal chest X-ray, and microbiology results show no growth in blood and sputum cultures but a positive urine culture for P. stuartii.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Urosepsis/UTI:
- Discontinue vancomycin and change from cefipime to ceftriaxone based on sensitivities.
- Continue steroids as below.
- Restart levophed and wean vasopressin.
- Check cardiac output with Vigileo and consider dobutamine due to persistent pressor requirement.

2. Adrenal Insufficiency:
- Continue hydrocortisone 50mg q8h and consider taper after off pressors.

3. Respiratory Failure due to altered mental status/aspiration:
- Perform spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today.
- Allow for auto-diuresis and consider lasix if needed to maintain euvolemia.

4. Acute renal failure:
- Likely septis-induced injury/acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Urine output is improving, and creatinine is decreasing.
- Consider diuresis today.

5. Thrombocytopenia/anemia:
- HIT pending; off heparin.
- Repeat HCT this afternoon; no evidence of active bleeding.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP precautions. The patient is critically ill."

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan as above with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   80 year old female with history of dementia and recurrent UTIs who
   presented with hypotension/shock believed secondary to urinary tract
   infection (gram negatives growing from urine).  She remains on small
   dose of vasopressors and has a marginal urine output and is
   hypothermic.
   T 36.6  P 64  BP 100/45  RR 23  Sat: 98%
   Intubated, sedated
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Heart: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: soft NT ND
   Extrem: warm but on warming blanket
   Assessment:
   1)       Septic Shock: presumably due to UTI though there was some GB
   wall thickening and was being followed by surgery who feel low
   likelihood of GB as etiology.  Given that she is growing gram negatives
   from urine, I think this is the most likely source but it is concerning
   to me that she remains relatively hypotensive, hypothermia, and with
   marginal urine output.  Given that her current hemoglobin is quite low
   and showing hypodynamic physiology, we will first treat this and try to
   wean off the small dose of vasopressors and improve hemodynamics.  If
   unable, will consider further exploration of the GB.
   2)       Acute Respiratory Failure
   3)       Baseline Dementia
   Plan:
   1)       Check hemodynamics with pulse contour analysis -> CI 2.6
   2)       Transfuse 2 units of blood and wean off vasopressin as
   tolerated -> re-evaluate the hemodynamics/urine output after
   transfusion
   3)       Continue mechanical ventilation -> wean sedation as tolerated
   Time Spent: 30 minutes

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 402**], MD
   on:[**2187-1-15**] 17:41 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She presented with hypotension and shock, believed to be secondary to a UTI caused by gram-negative bacteria. The patient remains on vasopressors and has marginal urine output. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Urosepsis/UTI: The patient's condition may worsen if the infection spreads further, leading to septic shock.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may have an underlying adrenal insufficiency, which can contribute to her shock and hypotension.
3. Respiratory Failure: Due to altered mental status and aspiration, there is a risk of ongoing respiratory failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate due to sepsis-induced injury or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient has thrombocytopenia and anemia, which could be related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or another underlying condition.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infections. She was admitted with confusion and subsequent hypotension in the setting of a urinary tract infection and likely urosepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and is currently in the intensive care unit.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient's blood pressure remains stable off pressors after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells. Antibiotics have been continued for a 14-day course.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension. Renal function is stable, and medications are being dosed based on renal function. The patient will be monitored closely, with an emphasis on maintaining equal intake and output, and waiting for post-ATN diuresis.

3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: These conditions may be due to bone marrow suppression secondary to infection. No signs of hemolysis are present on current labs, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs are negative. The patient has a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody (HIT ab), but there is low suspicion for actual HIT. A serotonin release assay is pending. Further follow-up with hematology is recommended, and the need"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia and diabetes mellitus, who was admitted with confusion and subsequent hypotension in the setting of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and likely urosepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient's blood pressure remains stable off pressors after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential to ensure it remains stable.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension, as evidenced by stable renal function. Renal dosing of medications should be considered, and careful monitoring of intake and output (Is and Os) is necessary. Diuretics may be considered to maintain equal Is and Os and await post-ATN diuresis.

3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to bone marrow suppression caused by infection. No signs of hemolysis are currently observed on lab results, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs are negative. However, the patient has tested positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody, although the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with dementia and a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted with urosepsis and has since shown improvement in her hemodynamics. She remains critically ill and requires ongoing care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient's fever curve has improved, and her urine output is increasing. However, there is no clear etiology identified for the urosepsis besides the urinary source. It is important to continue treating the urinary source and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to poor mental status and concern for aspiration. She failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today, so weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging. Close monitoring and repeated SBTs will be necessary to assess her readiness for extubation.
3. HIT+: The patient tested positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT+). Argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been started as an alternative anticoagulant to heparin. Further evaluation with serotonin assay and discussion regarding treatment versus prophylaxis for HIT+ is required.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but ongoing monitoring and diuresis are needed to manage fluid balance and prevent further deterioration of renal function.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient is receiving Fibers"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of dementia and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) admitted to the ICU with urosepsis. She received a blood transfusion and is now off pressors. The patient's urine output has improved, but she remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her temperature is slightly elevated, and her respiratory rate is within normal limits. Blood cultures show no new data, and the patient's laboratory values indicate some abnormalities including low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly low albumin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient's condition is improving, with fever curve improvement, off pressors, and improving urine output. However, she still requires aggressive treatment with antibiotics (Ceftriaxone for 2 weeks) and close monitoring for any signs of deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated due to respiratory failure, which may be related to her poor mental status and risk of aspiration. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was unsuccessful today, so it will be attempted again tomorrow. If successful, the patient may be weaned off mechanical ventilation gradually.
3. HIT+ (Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia): The patient tested positive for HIT, an immune-mediated adverse reaction to heparin. This has led to the discontinuation of heparin products and initiation of argatroban therapy. Monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with urosepsis.
- He has a history of thrombocytopenia and potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure range of 120-152 mmHg and a heart rate range of 62-89 bpm.
- He is receiving argatroban for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and has an arterial line and multi-lumen central line in place.
- The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 268 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 66 mg/dL and 170 mg/dL.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate levels, while platelet (Plt) count is within normal range.
- Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension.
- The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but it normalized after stopping heparin.
- Cardiac markers are negative, and an echocardiogram reveals reduced global function without focal wall motion abnormalities"

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dementia, and frequent urinary tract infections. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, and bradycardia and was diagnosed with urosepsis and thrombocytopenia. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Cultures have grown Providentia stuartii in the blood. The patient's leukocytosis is stable, and she is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) but is currently afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with urosepsis and has received appropriate antibiotic treatment. However, there is a possibility of developing further complications related to sepsis, such as organ dysfunction or septic shock.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, which may be due to bone marrow suppression caused by infection. Close monitoring of platelet levels and follow-up with hematology recommendations are necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This could be due to dehydration or hypovolemia. Administration of D5W and reevaluation of sodium levels are recommended.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient may have acute tubular"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of urosepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including hypotension secondary to sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated PTT, sinus bradycardia, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.3 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 62 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 140/56 mmHg (91/69 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, decreased platelet count, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's treatment plan includes receiving intravenous antibiotics, argatroban for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, diuretics for fluid management, and renal dose medications. The patient is also on a nutrition regimen and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, acute kidney injury, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy, respiratory distress, and further deterioration of cardiac function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis secondary to urosepsis caused by Providentia stuartii. The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), acute renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 140/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR). The patient has a history of hypertension, for which they were taking metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable off pressors after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypotension.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, but sinus bradycardia may persist due"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypernatremia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and an inability to protect his airway. He is currently receiving argatroban infusion and other medications including furosemide and lansoprazole. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9Â°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 140/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His current weight is 63.1 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,333 mL, including 399 mL of total in, 1,089 mL of TF (likely referring to tube feeding), 524 mL of IV fluids, and 140 mL of blood products. The output includes 3,350 mL of urine, -1,017 mL of negative balance in the NG (nasogastric) tube, and -186 mL of negative balance in the drains. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 268 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 108 K/uL, sodium of 150 mg/dL, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, and creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided, including WBC count, hematocrit, and various enzyme levels.

The patient's medical history includes heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and a recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that was surgically removed. The patient's allergies include heparin agents. The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypernatremia, development of further thrombocytopenia due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's inability to protect his airway. Close monitoring of the patient's electrolyte levels, platelet count, and respiratory status is essential to prevent or manage these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dementia, and frequent urinary tract infections. She was admitted with altered mental status, hypotension, and bradycardia and was found to have urosepsis and thrombocytopenia. The patient has received two units of packed red blood cells and is now hemodynamically stable. Her C. diff test is negative. There is a possible right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, and she has leukocytosis. She is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia but is currently afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with urosepsis, which has been stabilized with antibiotics and blood transfusion. Close monitoring is required.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and she has received D5W to help correct the imbalance. Further monitoring and rechecking of sodium levels are needed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient may have acute tubular necrosis due to hypotension, resulting in stable renal function. Medications should be dosed based on renal function, and equal intake and output should be maintained.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: These conditions may be due to bone marrow suppression caused by infection. No signs of hemolysis are present on current labs, and DIC labs are negative."

   airway protection and possible aspiration.
   1.       Respiratory failure:  Secretions improved, CXR does have
   increased RLL/bilateral infiltrates, and low-grade fever.
   - SBT now, plan to extubate if she does well
   - Lasix 20mg x 1 to assist with diuresis, TBB negative 500-1L today
   - Check sputum culture; low-threshold to initiate antibiotics
   2.       Urosepsis:  hypotension resolved
   - no current evidence of shock; off pressors for two days
   - Evidence of adrenal insufficiency with [**Last Name (un) **] stim; tapering prednisone
   - Continue ceftriaxone
   3.       HIT+:
   - continue argatroban
   - Heme following; await serotonin release assay
   4.       Hypernatremia:
   - D5W for free water repletion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:   Tube feeds held, will restart if unable to extubate..  NGT
   prior to extubation, will need speech evaluation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old female admitted with hypotension and confusion due to suspected urosepsis. She is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is being treated with argatroban, an anticoagulant. She also has hypernatremia and is receiving D5W for free water repletion.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/53 to 152/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, and fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,333 mL, output of 3,350 mL, and a negative balance of 1,017 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone), insulin sliding scale, furosemide (Lasix), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and others.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 108 K/uL, creatinine of 1"

   1.       Respiratory failure:  Secretions improved, CXR does have
   increased RLL/bilateral infiltrates, and low-grade fever.
   - SBT now, plan to extubate if she does well
   - Lasix 20mg x 1 to assist with diuresis, TBB negative 500-1L today
   - Check sputum culture; low-threshold to initiate antibiotics
   2.       Urosepsis:  hypotension resolved
   - no current evidence of shock; off pressors for two days
   - Evidence of adrenal insufficiency with [**Last Name (un) **] stim; tapering prednisone
   - Continue ceftriaxone
   3.       HIT+:
   - continue argatroban

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with suspected urosepsis and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and requires airway protection and possible aspiration. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/53-152/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has been receiving argatroban for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and ceftriaxone for urosepsis. She also has hypernatremia and is being given D5W for free water repletion. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 293 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurologically, the patient follows commands and awakens to voice.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal coagulation profile with prolonged prothrombin time ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dementia, and frequent urinary tract infections. She presents with altered mental status, hypotension, and bradycardia, and is diagnosed with urosepsis and thrombocytopenia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which could be due to hypovolemia and dehydration. This may improve now that the patient is extubated and eating/drinking.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of hypotension and renal function continues to improve. It is likely that she has acute tubular necrosis (ATN), resulting in acute renal failure. Renal dosing of medications and monitoring input/output are important to prevent post-ATN diuresis.

3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient may have anemia and thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow suppression caused by infection. No signs of hemolysis are observed on current labs, and DIC labs are negative.

4. Elevated PTT/INR: The patient's PTT/INR levels are elevated, but they have improved now that argatroban (a medication used for anticoagulation in patients with heparin-induced throm"

   possible opacity in right lobe. Afebrile, but leukocytosis worse today.
   Given her age, it is possible she may not develop a fever and CXR could
   be demonstrating an early infiltrate and patient could be at risk for
   VAP
   - follow up sputum culture
   - Con
t  ceftriaxone for 14 day course from [**1-12**] for Providencia, and
   3 day course of ampicillin from [**1-18**] for Entercoccus
   - If [**Last Name (LF) 3708**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] broaden to VAP coverage
   - d/c Stress dose steroids today
   -  request for PICC line today
   # Hypernatremia: Na back up to 148 from 143 yesterday after 1.5 L of
   D5W. Free water deficity approximately 1 L. Several litres negative
   since admission. Likely hypovolemic, but total body volume overloaded.
   I anticipate this will improve now that patient is extubated and
   eating/drinking.
   - D5W  1 L
   - repeat Na this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure: Likely has ATN from hypotension, renal function
   continues to improve. Total body overloaded.
   -Renally dose meds
   -Monitor I/O in setting of post ATN diuresis with goal negative 1 L.
   Lasix 20 mg IV x1 if needed to get to goal.

   intermediate probability and has no obvious sequelae from HIT.
   Serotonin release assay pending. Argatroban stopped yseterday and
   platelets continue to improve.
   - f/u Hematology recs
   - follow seratonic release assay
   - Hold heparin products for now
    # Elevated PTT/INR: Improve now that argatroban off.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dementia, and frequent urinary tract infections. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, and bradycardia and was found to have urosepsis and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently extubated and on supplemental oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has a positive culture for Enterococcus and Providencia stuartii, and her sodium levels are high. She also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to bone marrow suppression caused by infection. Her renal function continues to improve, and she has been receiving diuretics to manage fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's risk factors include being intubated for several days, leukocytosis, and possible opacity in the right lobe seen on imaging. It is important to follow up with sputum cultures and consider broadening antibiotic coverage if VAP is suspected.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypernatremia. This can be managed by providing intravenous D5W and monitoring sodium levels. The patient's fluid status is complex, with both hypovolemia and fluid overload, so careful management is required.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved, but she may still be at risk for acute renal failure due to hypotension and potential acute tubular necrosis. Renal dosing of medications and close monitoring of input/output are necessary.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: These conditions may be due to bone marrow suppression caused by infection. Further evaluation of hematology recommendations and follow-up serotonergic release assay are needed.
5. Elevated PTT/INR: These values have improved now that argatroban has been stopped. Continued monitoring is necessary to ensure that they remain within normal ranges.
6. Sinus bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has improved, but it is important to monitor for any further changes or complications related to rate control agents.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is now extubated and doing well on supplemental oxygen. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and weaning off oxygen as tolerated is important.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional evaluation and assessment may be required for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition."
