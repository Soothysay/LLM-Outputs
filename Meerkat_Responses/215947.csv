   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis vs. pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - inspiratory spirometry, encourage sitting up
   - ? need for thoracentesis is no improvement in effusions
   - repeat ABG
   .
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Hypovolemia still may be
   exacerbating his tachycardia given low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant
   with LVH, possibly HOCM? Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac
   enzymes negative -3. Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - f/u cards recommendations
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   Echo results: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global
   normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction). Mildly
   dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - f/u cards recs
   -telemetry
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   .
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.
   - TF
   - pain control w/ IV dilaudid
   - f/u surgery recs, clarify use of J-tube

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis vs. pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT
   -OOB to chair
   - ? need for thoracentesis is no improvement in effusions
   - repeat ABG if patient becomes increasingly hypoxic
   .
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Hypovolemia still may be
   exacerbating his tachycardia given low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant
   with LVH, possibly HOCM? Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac
   enzymes negative -3. Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - f/u cards recommendations
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   -1U PRBC
   -PT to assist with ambulation
   Echo results: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global
   normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction). Mildly
   dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   -increase metoprolol to 10mg
   - f/u cards recs
   - telemetry
   - 1U PRBC to maintain hct >28 in setting of ?CAD
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   .
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who recently underwent a subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy for signet-ring cell gastric cancer. He presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 108/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87% on 6L O2. The patient is currently on ventilatory support with a medium concentration mask.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and elevated glucose level of 151 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are below the detection limit. The ECG shows transient ST elevations, which are concerning for ischemia but cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no acute myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram reveals moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function, mild right ventricular dilatation, and mild aortic root dilatation.

Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and he is hypoxic with a saturation of 87% on 6L O2. This could be due to atelectasis, pleural effusions, or post-operative pneumoperitoneum. The plan includes inspiratory spirometry, chest PT, and consideration for thoracentesis if no improvement in effusions is seen.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated at 84 bpm. This could be due to hypovolemia, as indicated by low urine output and central venous pressure. Metoprolol has been started to control the heart rate, and further evaluation for possible cardiac causes such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is being pursued.
3. Low Urine Output: The patient's urine output is low at 80 cc/hr, which may be due to hypovolemia or pre-renal etiology. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing, and close monitoring of urine output is planned.
4. Gastric Cancer and Surgical Complications: The patient had a partial gastrectomy and transverse colectomy for gastric cancer. The incision healing is noted to be nice, and a J-tube is in place for feeding.
5. Other: The patient's lines, prophylaxis, and code status are mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to hypoxia, increased oxygen requirement, and the need for ventilatory support. A"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of chest discomfort and mild epigastric discomfort.
- The patient has undergone several tests, including an EKG, multi-lumen insertion, and a trans-thoracic echo.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 84 bpm with a range of 70-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/63 mmHg to 130/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a range of 9-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 87% on 6L O2.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 4 mmHg with a range of 2-6 mmHg.
- Fluid balance indicates a total intake of 1,970 mL and an output of 700 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,270 mL.
- The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and pantoprazole (Protonix) for gastric protection.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 14.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 34.0%, platelet count (Plt) at 443 K/uL, blood glucose at 151 mg/dL, troponin-T levels below 0.01 mg/dL, and several other abnormal values.
- The patient is on respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a medium concentration mask, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) shows hypoxemia.
- Physical examination findings are not provided in the given progress note.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 87% on 6L O2, indicating possible respiratory distress or failure.
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count may suggest an underlying infection.
3. Cardiac issues: The chest discomfort and abnormal troponin-T levels may indicate cardiac injury or ischemia.
4. Coagulation problems: The prolonged PT/PTT/INR values may suggest a bleeding or clotting disorder.
5. Fluid imbalance: The fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,270 mL, which may indicate fluid overload.
6. Stress ulcer: The use of pantoprazole suggests a concern for stress ulcer development.

It is important to note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the information provided in the progress note, and further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy now admit to ICU
   with post operative hyoxemia, chest discomfort and decreased urine
   output.  He has findings on CT scan to suggest significant regions of
   atelectasis and likely shunt through those regions contributing to
   hypoxia.  No significant findings of PE are described in review of
   scan.  He has had persistent hypoxemia but no significant worsening.
   Decreased HCT is noted overnight.
   1)Hypoxemia
Patient has bilateral areas of consolidation and consistent
   with significant collapse.  Will need to maintain adquate oxygen
   support to allow ambulation
   -OOB to chair
   -OOB and ambulation
   -Continue with good pain control
   -No evidence of PE on CTA
   -
   2)Anemia
he does have decreased HCT noted and has been discussed with
   surgery team
   -Plan to repeat HCT this pm
   3)Tachycardia and ST segment elevations-Is concern for significant
   myocardial ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and anemia.
   Encouraging that patient does not have significant evidence of
   myocardial injury but will need supportive Rx with ASA., rate control
   and adquate volume for ventricular filling
   -ASA to continue
   -PRBC goal would be reasonable to be 30 in the setting of active
   ischemia as suggested by cardiology evaluation and findings on ECG
   -B-blocker and statin are in place

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent gastrectomy and transverse colectomy and is now admitted to the ICU with postoperative hypoxemia, chest discomfort, and decreased urine output. The patient has findings on the CT scan suggesting significant regions of atelectasis and likely shunt through those regions contributing to hypoxia. There are no significant findings of pulmonary embolism described in the review of the scan.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1) Hypoxemia: The patient has bilateral areas of consolidation and consistent with significant collapse. Adequate oxygen support should be maintained to allow ambulation.

2) Anemia: The patient has decreased HCT (hematocrit) noted overnight. This will be discussed with the surgery team, and a plan to repeat HCT this afternoon is made.

3) Tachycardia and ST segment elevations: There is concern for significant myocardial ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and anemia. Supportive treatment with ASA (aspirin), rate control, and adequate volume for ventricular filling is recommended. PRBC (packed red blood cells) goal would be reasonable to be 30 in the setting of active ischemia as suggested by cardiology evaluation and findings on ECG. B-blocker and statin are already in place.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who has recently undergone a subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy for signet-ring cell gastric cancer. He is currently in the ICU and presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.

The patient started on tube feeds and sips yesterday but tolerated it poorly, experiencing bilious emesis, nausea, dark watery brown stool, and belching. The decision was made to hold tube feeds and make him NPO (nothing by mouth) again. An upper GI with small bowel follow-through has been ordered. The patient also expressed extreme anxiety overnight.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/71 to 146/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a medium concentration mask. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating total input of 1,911 mL, total output of 708 mL, and a urine output of 708 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 14.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.4 g/dL, blood glucose level of 151 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, and potassium (K+) level of 4.4 mEq/L. The troponin-T level is below 0.01 ng/mL, indicating no signs of myocardial infarction. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals moderate tenderness in the midline surgical staples area, diminished breath sounds at the bases of the lungs, and absent pulses in both right and left dorsal pedis (DP) vessels. Neurological assessment shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, time, and place, and has not been assessed for movement or tone.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Ischemia: The patient's EKG changes and persistent tachycardia are concerning for ischemia, which may require further investigation and intervention.

2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bilious emesis, dark watery brown stool, and nausea suggest possible gastrointestinal issues such as ileus, obstruction, or perforation. The planned upper GI with small bowel follow-through can help identify the cause.

3. Infection: The elevated WBC count may indicate an infection. The patient's vital signs, particularly the fever, also suggest a possible infection. Cultures"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Post op day 3. Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.
   Now with bilious emesis and nausea after starting sips and tube feeds
   yesterday.
   - tube feeds started yesterday, although now on hold again given
   bilious emesis  - suspect that most likely etiology is ileus in the
   setting of being bedridden and post-op and not eating much, additional
   possibility is that patient with SBO
   - return to NPO
   - in for upper GI with small bowel follow-through this morning, will
   follow up with surgery regarding plan after scan
   - as per surgery do NOT place NG tube, do NOT give raglan  for nausea,
   will need to reassess plan for care
   - pain control w/ IV dilaudid PCA
   - f/u surgery recs, clarify use of J-tube
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis and pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - chest x-ray from 9 /23 -
   Since yesterday, left pleural effusion significantly increased, with
   adjacent
   atelectasis. Right pleural effusion with basal atelectasis is
   unchanged.
   There is no significant pulmonary edema, but vascular congestion
   persists.
   Right subclavian catheter was installed, probably ends in right atrium.
   No
   pneumothorax. Heart size is unchanged.
   - CT scan of chest [**10-16**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
   3. Right lower, right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis with
   fluid-
   filled airways possibly from a component of aspiration.
   4. Mild ascites as well as fluid within the pericolic gutters and
   lesser sac.
   Omental edema and small mesenteric fluid collection likely related to
   postoperative changes without evidence for anastomotic leak.
   5. Small intra-abdominal free air, likely related to postoperative
   changes.
   6. Mild small bowel dilatation which is incompletely visualized with no
   focal
   obstruction visualized, likely related to postoperative ileus.
   7. Hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney incompletely
   characterized on this study and could represent either a hyperdense
   cyst or a
   mass. Would recommend further evaluation with MRI when patient is
   clinically
   able to tolerate study.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT, out of bed to chair, PT to assist
   with ambulation
   - consider therapeutic as well as diagnostic tap of pleural effusions
   if do not improve
 will get ultrasound today to assess size
   - oxygen requirement has been stable
   #Agitation
   Patient was extremely agitated overnight and did not sleep much.
   Appears extremely anxious and worried. Tried ativan 1 mg IV this
   morning which appears to have led to delirium.
   -          avoid benzos in the patient for agitation
   -          would try haldol PRN for agitation
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Also s/p transfusion of
   pRBCs x1. Hypovolemia still may be exacerbating his tachycardia given
   initial low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant with LVH, possibly HOCM?
   Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac enzymes negative -3.
   Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - cardiology reccomendations - no cath for now; consider esmolol if
   hypotensive (increase diastolic filling)
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   - Echo results: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   global normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction).
   Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   - will increase beta blocker dose as HR consistently in the 80s
   - follow-up with new cards recs today
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - cards recs as above
   - cont telemetry
   - crit this AM is 30, so no need for additional transfusion at this
   time
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   # Anxiety
   - patient is very anxious, will likely require something at night to
   sleep, this morning given ativan 1-2 mg IV x 1once, need to follow-up
   with surgery regarding plan for treatment
   .
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, likely need to restart maintence fluids, again
   will defer to surgery
   .
   # Access: right subclavian, PIV x2

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place. Now with bilious
   emesis and nausea after starting sips and tube feeds yesterday.
   - tube feeds started yesterday, although now on hold again given
   bilious emesis
   - return to NPO
   - in for upper GI with small bowel follow-through this morning, will
   follow up with surgery regarding plan after scan
   - pain control w/ IV dilaudid PCA
   - f/u surgery recs, clarify use of J-tube
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis and pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - chest x-ray from 9 /23 -
   Since yesterday, left pleural effusion significantly increased, with
   adjacent
   atelectasis. Right pleural effusion with basal atelectasis is
   unchanged.
   There is no significant pulmonary edema, but vascular congestion
   persists.
   Right subclavian catheter was installed, probably ends in right atrium.
   No
   pneumothorax. Heart size is unchanged.
   - CT scan of chest [**10-16**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
   3. Right lower, right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis with
   fluid-
   filled airways possibly from a component of aspiration.
   4. Mild ascites as well as fluid within the pericolic gutters and
   lesser sac.
   Omental edema and small mesenteric fluid collection likely related to
   postoperative changes without evidence for anastomotic leak.
   5. Small intra-abdominal free air, likely related to postoperative
   changes.
   6. Mild small bowel dilatation which is incompletely visualized with no
   focal
   obstruction visualized, likely related to postoperative ileus.
   7. Hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney incompletely
   characterized on this study and could represent either a hyperdense
   cyst or a
   mass. Would recommend further evaluation with MRI when patient is
   clinically
   able to tolerate study.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT, out of bed to chair, PT to assist
   with ambulation
   - consider therapeutic as well as diagnostic tap of pleural effusions
   if do not improve
   - oxygen requirement has been stable
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Also s/p transfusion of
   pRBCs x1. Hypovolemia still may be exacerbating his tachycardia given
   initial low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant with LVH, possibly HOCM?
   Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac enzymes negative -3.
   Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - cardiology reccomendations - no cath for now; consider esmolol if
   hypotensive (increase diastolic filling)
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   - Echo results: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   global normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction).
   Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - cards recs as above
   - cont telemetry telemetry
   - crit this AM is 30, so no need for additional transfusion at this
   time
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   # Anxiety
   - patient is very anxious, will likely require something at night to
   sleep, this morning given ativan 1-2 mg IV x 1once, need to follow-up
   with surgery regarding plan for treatment
   .
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, likely need to restart maintence fluids, again
   will defer to surgery

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer. He underwent subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy. The patient is currently in the ICU and presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.

The patient started on tube feeds and sips yesterday but then experienced bilious emesis with nausea overnight. He passed dark watery brown stool and had moderate tenderness in the midline surgical staples. The decision was made to hold tube feeds and make the patient NPO again. An upper GI with small bowel follow-through is planned for further evaluation.

The patient is also extremely anxious and requires sleep medication. He has been started on metoprolol for tachycardia and has received a blood transfusion. His pleural effusions have increased, and there is evidence of atelectasis and fluid-filled airways on imaging studies. The patient also has mild ascites and fluid within the pericolic gutters and lesser sac, which are likely related to postoperative changes. There is also evidence of small intra-abdominal free air, likely related to postoperative changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bilious emesis and nausea after starting sips and tube feeds may indicate an issue with the gastrointestinal anastomosis or small bowel obstruction.
2. Persistent tachyc"

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo man s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end
   anastomosis in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with post operative hyoxemia thought to be [**2-25**]
   atelectasis and effusions; no e/o PE or cardiac ischemia.
   1) Hypoxemia: Persists
 he has not been up walking, but was up OOB in
   chair yesterday. Currently he is compromised by his altered mental
   status presumptively [**2-25**] ativan. When sensorium clears, continue IS and
   encourage up OOB as his abdominal symptoms allow. PT to work with
   patient. Continue nebs. Continue pain control in post-op setting.
   Again, his hypoxia does not appear to be [**2-25**] infection (no e/o
   pneumonia, embolism, edema or ischemia.) Will assess effusions with U/S
   today as draining them may assist  with lung expansion.
   -
   2) Nausea / vomiting: Off TFs and d/c
ed sips of clears [**2-25**] nausea and
   vomiting. Plan for UGI with SBFT today to evaluate for any e/o SBO. No
   Reglan or NGT per Surgery service. No e/o a catostrophic abdominal
   process
 his abdomen is not tender and he is not rigid. Most likely
   his symptoms are [**2-25**] a post-op ileus however ruling out a SBO is
   warranted and the UGI with SBFT is pending. Increasing frequency of
   anti-emetics would be helpful as well.
   -in follow up a the time of signing of this note patient has CT scan
   c/w ileus and no obstruction
   3) Delirium: Almost certainly [**2-25**] Ativan
 would avoid this in the
   future. Consider Haldol for anxiety in the future.
   4) Heme: Hct stable without e/o active blood loss. Follow daily,
   transfusion goal ~30% given h/o CAD.
   5) CAD: Concern for sub-critical LAD lesion given prior ST elevations.
   Medical management with statins, aspirin and beta-blockade. Goal HR

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis. He presented with postoperative hypoxia, which was initially thought to be due to atelectasis and effusions. However, further evaluation revealed that the hypoxia persists despite initial interventions. The patient's altered mental status is presumed to be caused by Ativan. It is planned to continue incentive spirometry and encourage the patient to be out of bed as his abdominal symptoms allow. Pain control will continue in the post-operative setting.

The patient also experienced nausea and vomiting, leading to the decision to discontinue tube feeds and remove the nasogastric tube. A plan for upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through (UGI/SBFT) has been made to evaluate for any evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient's symptoms are most likely attributed to a post-operative ileus, but ruling out SBO is necessary. A CT scan later confirmed ileus and no obstruction.

Additionally, the patient exhibited signs of delirium, which is believed to be caused by Ativan. Lorazepam has been considered as an alternative for managing anxiety in the future.

Other assessments include stable hemoglobin concentration without any signs of active blood loss. Daily follow-up and transfusion goal of approximately 30% have been set considering the patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD). The concern for a sub"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of low urine output (UOP) and hypoxia post-operation. The patient started sipping clears yesterday and overnight had anxiety and nausea. He experienced a large watery bowel movement, nausea, and belching. Zofran IV was administered to address these symptoms, and tube feeds were held.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to no known drugs, as well as recent infusions of Pantoprazole, Metoprolol, Lorazepam, and Heparin Sodium. Other medications include Pantoprazole, Metoprolol, Lorazepam, and Heparin Sodium.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/57 mmHg to 146/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on medium concentration mask. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,911 mL with outputs including 708 mL of urine, 400 mL of nasogastric (NG) drainage, and 895 mL of blood products. The patient has received a total of 1,547 mL of intravenous fluids (IVF) and has a negative fluid balance of 404 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a medium concentration mask, and the patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be a well-nourished thin individual with no abnormalities in the eyes/conjunctiva, lymph nodes, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, or respiratory/chest area. Extremities show trace edema in both legs, and the patient's skin and neurologic examination were not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.9 K/uL with a decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 34.0% and platelet count of 84 K/uL. Blood chemistry values include elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, and normal troponin-T levels. Other lab results are within normal limits or do not show significant abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, central venous catheter, stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis, and medication administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and recent surgeries may increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased heart rate, or worsening respiratory symptoms, is necessary.
2. Fluid overload: Despite the negative fluid balance, the patient's recent fluid intake and output should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
3. DVT: As the patient is immobilized and undergoing major surgery, there is an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis. DVT prophylaxis should be continued as per the plan.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's recent bowel movement and nausea indicate gastrointestinal distress. Stress ulcer prophylaxis should be continued to prevent the development of stress ulcers.
5. VAP: Due to the patient's intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and adherence to VAP prophylaxis measures are crucial.
6. Medication-related complications: The patient is on multiple medications including Heparin Sodium, a blood thinner, and other medications that may have side effects. Regular monitoring of medication levels and close observation for any signs of adverse drug reactions are necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man who underwent gastrectomy and transverse colectomy in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]. He was admitted with postoperative hypoxemia thought to be caused by atelectasis and effusions without evidence of pulmonary embolism or cardiac ischemia. The patient remains hypoxemic, with an altered mental status possibly due to lorazepam. He has anemia with a decreased hematocrit level, and there is a concern for significant myocardial ischemia given the tachycardia and ST segment elevations. The patient does not have significant evidence of myocardial injury but requires supportive treatment with aspirin, rate control, and adequate volume for ventricular filling. Blood transfusion is recommended to reach a goal of 30 PRBCs in the setting of active ischemia as suggested by cardiology evaluation and findings on ECG. A beta-blocker and statin are already in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels persist despite previous interventions. It is crucial to identify and address the underlying cause of the hypoxemia to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Anemia: The patient has a decreased hematocrit level, indicating anemia. This condition needs to be corrected to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues and prevent complications associated with reduced blood flow.
3. Tachycardia and ST segment elevations: These findings suggest the possibility of significant myocard"

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo man s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end
   anastomosis in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with post operative hyoxemia thought to be [**2-25**]
   atelectasis and effusions; no e/o PE or cardiac ischemia.
   1) Hypoxemia: Persists
 he has not been up walking, but was up OOB in
   chair yesterday. Currently he is compromised by his altered mental
   status presumptively [**2-25**] ativan. When sensorium clears, continue IS and
   encourage up OOB as his abdominal symptoms allow. PT to work with
   patient. Continue nebs. Continue pain control in post-op setting.
   Again, his hypoxia does not appear to be [**2-25**] infection (no e/o
   pneumonia, embolism, edema or ischemia.) Will assess effusions with U/S
   today as draining them may assist  with lung expansion.
   -
   2) Nausea / vomiting: Off TFs and d/c
ed sips of clears [**2-25**] nausea and
   vomiting. Plan for UGI with SBFT today to evaluate for any e/o SBO. No
   Reglan or NGT per Surgery service. No e/o a catostrophic abdominal
   process
 his abdomen is not tender and he is not rigid. Most likely
   his symptoms are [**2-25**] a post-op ileus however ruling out a SBO is
   warranted and the UGI with SBFT is pending. Increasing frequency of
   anti-emetics would be helpful as well.
   3) Delirium: Almost certainly [**2-25**] Ativan
 would avoid this in the
   future. Consider Haldol for anxiety in the future.
   4) Heme: Hct stable without e/o active blood loss. Follow daily,
   transfusion goal ~30% given h/o CAD.
   5) CAD: Concern for sub-critical LAD lesion given prior ST elevations.
   Medical management with statins, aspirin and beta-blockade. Goal HR
   apparently is 60-70, adjust beta-blockade as needed. Appreciate
   Cardiology input; may need cath at some point to assess coronary artery
   vasculature however this is not urgent.
   6) Renal: Following UOP and creatinine. Keeping IVF at 50cc/hr. CVP
   appears adequate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man who underwent a gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis. He is currently in the ICU with postoperative hypoxia, which was initially thought to be due to atelectasis and effusions but now appears to be unrelated to infection, embolism, edema, or ischemia. The patient also experiences nausea, vomiting, and delirium, which may be attributed to Ativan. He has a history of coronary artery disease and is being managed with medical therapy including statins, aspirin, and beta-blockade. The patient's renal function is being monitored, and he is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 50cc/hr.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels persist, and he is compromised by his altered mental status presumptively due to Ativan. When his sensorium clears, he will continue to receive incentive spirometry and encouraged to be up and out of bed as his abdominal symptoms allow.
2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, and tube feeds have been stopped. A plan for an upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through (UGI with SBFT) is pending to evaluate for any signs of small bowel obstruction (SBO).
3. Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing delirium, which is almost certainly due to At"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who presented with hypoxia and is currently being monitored for urine output. The patient experienced confusion yesterday morning, which was likely due to the administration of lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety. Benzodiazepines will be avoided moving forward, and haloperidol (Haldol) will be used instead. A small bowel follow-through (SBFT) yesterday showed post-operative ileus. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed via fluoroscopy, but the patient removed it. A new NGT will only be placed if the patient starts vomiting. Cardiology recommended increasing the patient's beta blocker due to persistent tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's initial complaint was hypoxia, which indicates a possible respiratory issue. The ABG results show a pH level of 7.51, suggesting respiratory alkalosis. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory function is necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

2. Gastrointestinal complications: The SBFT revealed post-operative ileus, indicating a temporary paralysis of the muscles in the intestines after surgery. This can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. The patient's abdominal examination showed tenderness and distention, which may indicate ongoing gastrointestinal complications.

3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has persistent tachycardia, as mentioned in"

   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxic respiratory distress since day
   1, which most likely is consistend with atelectasis and pleural
   effusion seen on CXR. Cardiac etiology may be possible, but not likely
   given no evidence of CHF on physical exam or in pre-op echocardiogram.
   However, there may be an inflow obstructive problem. [**Name (NI) **] may be
   pre-load dependent and now has CVP of 14. Patient has been afebrile
   with stable hemodynamics. Patient with stable oxygen requirements on
   15L

   #Agitation: Patient became agitated and confuses yesterday. He was
   sleep deprived, anxious, stressed and received 1mg of Ativan IV, which
   caused him to be delirious.
   -          Avoid benzodiacepines
   -          Haldol PRN for agitation
   # Tachycardia: Improving with beta-blocker; yesterday only borderline
   up to 107. Beta-blocker were increased yesterday and patient responded
   adequately.
   -          Continue IV metoprolol and swith to PO when ileus is

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who recently underwent a subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy for signet-ring cell gastric cancer. He presents with hypoxia, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia. The patient also has post-operative ileus, nausea, and bilious vomiting. He experienced confusion and agitation yesterday, which was likely caused by the administration of Ativan. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 119/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on medium concentration mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement is increasing, indicating a possible worsening of his respiratory distress. This could be due to atelectasis, pleural effusion, or an inflow obstructive problem.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia despite being on a beta-blocker. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, which could be related to pain, infection, or other underlying conditions.
3. Ischemia: The EKG changes raise concern for ischemia. Cardiac etiology should be considered, but it may also be related to vasospasm or another non-cardiac cause.
4. Post-operative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer and a postoperative course complicated by significant hypoxemia, likely due to atelectasis and postoperative ileus. The patient also has a concern for possible aspiration risk. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/61 mmHg to 138/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the flowsheet data. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a possible complication related to atelectasis and postoperative ileus. Atelectasis refers to the collapse of lung tissue, leading to decreased gas exchange and reduced oxygenation. Ileus is a condition characterized by a temporary stoppage of bowel movements, which can lead to abdominal distention and discomfort. These conditions can contribute to impaired respiratory function and decreased oxygen levels in the blood.

2. Aspiration Risk: The patient's postoperative ileus increases the risk of aspiration, where food, liquid, or stomach contents are inhaled into the lungs. This can result in pneumonia or other respiratory infections, potentially worsening the patient's hypoxemia.

3. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer and a post-operative course complicated by significant hypoxemia likely related to atelectasis as well as post-operative ileus leading to a significant concern for possible aspiration risk. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/61 mmHg to 138/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted hypoxemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the chest, dullness on percussion, and symmetric expansion. The patient's extremities show trace edema in both legs. The neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. The rest of the examination findings are unremarkable.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.9 K/uL and a decreased hematocrit level of 25.6%. The platelet count is within normal limits. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, and liver function tests are within normal ranges. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating but remain within normal limits.

Radiology findings include persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities on chest X-ray, consistent with collapse"
