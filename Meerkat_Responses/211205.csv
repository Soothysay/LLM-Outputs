   Assessment and Plan
   59M with ESRD on HD with tunnelled femoral line, recent prolonged
   hospital admission with MSSA bacteremia and lung abscesses, now
   admitted to MICU for fever and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Now resolved after fluid ressusitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been
   over dialyzed at HD vs. SIRS response in setting of fever and potential
   infection.  No e/o leukocytosis, tachycardia, or clear source of
   infection.  BPs currently holding stable.  Is, however, up 8kg from his
   dry weight, although bed weights less reliable.  Over currently stable
   and will continue to monitor with ID management given below.
   .
   # Fever: Likely [**1-25**] to high-grade bacteremia.   With chronic HD line,
   must be concerned for line associated infection. ED gave levo for RLL
   infiltrate, although appears stable from prior films.  Has chronic
   exudative effusion, with no hx of empyema.
   -- will continue vanc, f/u Bcx sensitivities
   -- given absence of pulm complaints and no change in old CXR, will hold
   more expanded pneumonia coverage, but send sputum for culture
   -- if patient isn'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11376**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] send UA/UCx
   -- discuss w/ renal removal of line.

   # ERSD on HD: will call renal to make sure they are aware of admission
   and cont qMWF HD.  Will cont home sevelamer and renal diet.
   .
   # RLL opacity:  Chronic compared to prior images, will send sputum
   culture and hold of further broadening of antibiotics.
   .
   # Seizure disorder: Will continue home oxcarbazepine and kepra.

   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with fevers in the hospital. They have been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, dialysis, and medication for seizures. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and slightly low oxygen saturation. Fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring indicate an ongoing fluid deficit. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but they have shown signs of recurrent MSSA bacteremia. The assessment and plan include continuing hemodialysis support, adding nafcillin if MSSA is confirmed, changing the vascular access line, and conducting further tests such as sputum cultures and a transthoracic echocardiogram if necessary. The patient also has end-stage renal disease, seizure disorder, and is receiving appropriate ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient could include worsening sepsis due to recurrent MSSA bacteremia, further decline in renal function, development of complications related to end-stage renal disease, and potential adverse effects from the medications being administered. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values to promptly identify any potential complications and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including sepsis, hypotension, fever, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of seizure disorder. They are currently being treated in the ICU with ongoing hemodialysis support. The patient has been experiencing fevers, primarily in their head and neck area. Blood cultures have been drawn and are pending results. The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. They are receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and seizure management drugs. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. They also have elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's electrolyte levels are somewhat imbalanced, with high potassium and low magnesium levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, and positive blood cultures suggest ongoing infection and sepsis. If not promptly treated, sepsis can lead to organ failure and potentially be life-threatening.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension. If not managed properly, this can result in inadequate organ perfusion and potentially lead to shock.
3. ESRD: The patient's renal function is severely compromised, requiring hemodialysis support. Long"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for fever and hypotension. The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and lung abscesses. Vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has received fluids and is currently stable with controlled blood pressure. However, he has gained 8 kg from his dry weight, which may be due to over-dialysis or fluid retention. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (401 K/uL), hemoglobin (8.6 g/dL), sodium (141 mEq/L), potassium (4.3 mEq/L), and creatinine (4.4 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, vancomycin, and various ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. Physical examination findings are unremarkable except for chronic exudative effusion in the right lower lobe of the lung. The patient's condition is complicated by potential high-grade bacteremia and a chronic lung condition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
