","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely caused by worsening COPD. Other possible causes such as pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary embolism (PE), pleural effusions, and heart failure have been ruled out through a chest X-ray and a computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient is also experiencing worsening cellulitis, and medical non-compliance has been identified as an issue.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 83 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 136/80 mmHg to 153/92 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,051 mL and an output of 300 mL through urine and 355 mL through other means.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 17.4 g/dL, glucose level of 165 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.9 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is intubated and sedated, receiving medications such as solumedrol, albuterol, ipratropium, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. She is being weaned off the ventilator and is expected to have further evaluation and treatment for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening COPD and continued smoking history may have contributed to her current respiratory failure. She is intubated and receiving respiratory support, but there is a risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's COPD may continue to deteriorate due to her medical non-compliance and smoking habits. This could lead to increased difficulty in weaning off the ventilator and prolonged respiratory support.
3. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis is worsening, and there is a risk of it progressing to necrotizing fasciitis or other severe infections. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Drug Interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, including solumedrol, albuterol, iprat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presented with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with fentanyl and versed for sedation. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to worsening COPD, and small pleural effusion. Chest CT and CTA results are negative for pulmonary embolism and heart failure. The patient is also being treated for chronic cellulitis with worsening changes and infection, and medical non-compliance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to worsening COPD and continued smoking. Close monitoring of ventilator settings and weaning process will be crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Pleural Effusion: The presence of a small pleural effusion indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs. If not managed properly, it can lead to pneumonia or worsen the respiratory failure.
3. Cellulitis: The chronic cellulitis with worsening changes and infection requires appropriate antibiotic coverage to prevent spread or complications such as necrotizing fasciitis.
4. Medical Non-compliance: The patient's history of medical non-compliance increases the risk of disease progression and poor outcomes. It is essential to address this issue through patient education and support.
5. Pneumonia: Given the patient's COPD and current respiratory"

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She is receiving sedation with fentanyl and versed. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but she is experiencing respiratory distress and requires assisted ventilation. Her oxygen saturation is at 88%. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin) for suspected pneumonia coverage. Blood cultures have been sent, and urine and sputum cultures will be followed up. The patient's cellulitis is worsening, and wound care consult has been requested. She also has chronic changes and infection in the lower extremities. Her medical non-compliance will be addressed with a social work consult. The patient's code status has been changed to full code from DNR/DNI. She has two peripheral IV lines and will have an arterial line placed today. The patient's nutritional status will be managed with pulmonary tube feeds.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening COPD, along with continued smoking and medical non-compliance, may lead to respiratory failure. The chest CT shows small pneumonia, and the arterial blood gas results indicate a high PCO2 level, suggesting respiratory distress.
2. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis is worsening over the past several months, indicating chronic changes and infection. This can potentially lead to further spread of infection and systemic complications.
3. Medical non-compliance: The patient's history of medical non-compliance can contribute to the worsening of her conditions, including COPD exacerbations and infections.
4. Pulmonary embolism: Although the CTA was negative for a pulmonary embolism, it cannot be completely ruled out as a potential complication.
5. Heart failure: The echocardiogram does not suggest heart failure, but there is mild LV diastolic dysfunction and thickening of the left ventricle.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current health status and medical history."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with severe COPD who presented to the primary care physician with hypoxemia and bilateral cellulitis. She was intubated in the emergency department due to a pCO2 level in the 100 range. The patient did not tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) because of oversedation.

The patient has been on several medications, including vancomycin and levofloxacin, which were started on 09/27/2165. She is also receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions. Additionally, she is taking heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and chlorhexidine gluconate.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/64 mmHg to 156/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator set to assist-control ventilation (ACV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2)"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the primary care physician with hypoxemia and bilateral cellulitis. She was intubated in the emergency department due to a high pCO2 level. The patient did not tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight due to oversedation.

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics (vancomycin and levofloxacin), sedatives (midazolam), analgesics (fentanyl), diuretics (furosemide), and proton pump inhibitors (pantoprazole). She has also been on heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/64 to 156/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 29 cmH2O, plateau pressure at 16 cmH2O, and compliance at 45.5 cm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving sedation with fentanyl and versed. She is also on various medications including albuterol, ipratropium, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening COPD, along with continued smoking and medical non-compliance, may lead to respiratory failure. The chest CT shows small pneumonia, and the CTA is negative for pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram does not suggest heart failure. It is likely that the patient has high carbon dioxide levels at baseline (70-75% given bicarbonate).

2. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis has been worsening over the past several months. There are likely chronic changes and infection present. Blood cultures thus far have been negative.

3. Medical Non-compliance: The patient has a history of medical non-compliance, which can contribute to her current health issues. A social work consult has been ordered to address this issue during the hospital course.

4. Code Status: The patient's code status was initially documented as do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI), but it was later confirmed"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance who presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and left lower extremity cellulitis. She is currently intubated and receiving sedation with fentanyl and versed. 

The patient's respiratory status is concerning for worsening COPD, as evidenced by her respiratory failure. She has an increased PCO2 level, indicating hypercarbia, and her chest CT shows signs of small pneumonia. A CT angiography was performed, which was negative for pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram does not suggest heart failure. 

The patient is being treated with albuterol every two hours and ipratropium every six hours for COPD management. She is also receiving vancomycin for pneumonia coverage and levofloxacin for atypical coverage for a total of five days. Levofloxacin was changed to 750 mg every 24 hours based on her improving creatinine levels. Theophylline has been held due to drug interactions. A flu nasal swab is pending. Ventilator settings are being weaned as tolerated.

Regarding the patient's cellulitis, it has been worsening over the past several months, likely due to chronic changes and infection. Blood cultures thus far have been negative. The treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics as above, with vancomycin for gram-positive coverage. A wound care consult has been requested, and follow-up"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presented with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated with fentanyl and versed. She is being treated for respiratory failure and cellulitis. Her medical non-compliance has been addressed. The patient's condition has worsened over the past several days, and she is now on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs show tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation. She has a history of smoking and her chest CT is concerning for small pneumonia. The patient's blood cultures are negative so far, and she is receiving antibiotics for both typical and atypical pathogens. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening COPD and continued smoking history increase the risk of respiratory failure. She is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which indicates the severity of her respiratory condition.
2. Pneumonia: The chest CT findings suggest a small pneumonia, which could potentially worsen and lead to a more severe infection.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has chronic changes and infection in her lower extremities, increasing the risk of further complications such as spread of infection or tissue necrosis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and her medical condition may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with severe COPD, admitted for lower extremity cellulitis and respiratory failure. She has shown improvement on spontaneous breathing trial, but remains on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and smoking. She is allergic to peanuts and has a rash as a result. She has been receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin), sedatives (midazolam), and other medications for her conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/58 mmHg to 152/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a net intake of 1609 mL and output of 3280 mL. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 67 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 153, and respiratory system compliance of 45.5 cmH2O/mL. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, attentive mental status, and no acute distress.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted with lower extremity cellulitis and respiratory failure. She has shown improvement and is currently on a spontaneous breathing trial. She has allergies to peanuts and is receiving antibiotics for cellulitis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although her respiratory rate is elevated at 29 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is low at 89%. Her fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,671 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving midazolam for sedation and various other medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and current respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications, such as worsening hypoxia or the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of cellulitis and ongoing antibiotic therapy suggests a risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic treatment as necessary is crucial.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The negative fluid balance indicates that the patient is losing more fluids than she is receiving. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is essential to prevent dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Sedation and Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation: The patient is currently on a spontaneous breathing trial, and sedation with midazolam is being used. Careful tit"

The plan includes continuing to decrease solumedrol, administering albuterol and ipratropium, using vancomycin for pneumonia coverage, continuing levofloxacin for atypical coverage, holding theophylline due to drug interactions, and weaning vent settings as tolerated. 

The patient also has worsening cellulitis, which is likely chronic with infection. Blood cultures have been negative so far. Antibiotics will be continued as above, with vancomycin for gram-positive coverage. A wound care consult has been requested, and follow-up cultures will be done. The patient is also being evaluated for medical non-compliance, with a social work consult over the hospital course. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving pulmonary nutrition and has lines placed for arterial blood gas monitoring. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending resolution of acute medical issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient received 20mg of lasix in the am and started diamox with rechecking of electrolytes at 1700. Cultures were obtained from blood (peripheral and arterial), sputum, urine, and nasal swab. The patient has allergies to peanuts and a rash. The patient was on vancomycin and then switched to ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn). The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. Pantoprazole (Protonix) was given for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium was administered for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. The patient also received furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.8C (100.1F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 117/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,464 mL and an output of 1,900 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 564 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 59.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is currently intubated and receiving sedation with fentanyl and versed. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to worsening COPD, and cellulitis. Blood cultures have been negative so far.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, as she is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in gas exchange and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Progression of lower extremity cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis has been worsening over the past several months, and there is a risk of it spreading or developing into a more severe infection such as necrotizing fasciitis.

3. Pulmonary embolism: Although a CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism, there is still a risk of developing this condition, especially given the patient's immobilization and underlying risk factors.

4. Heart failure: Although the echo does not suggest heart failure, the patient's hypoxia and hypercarbia may indicate a cardiac cause for her respiratory failure. Close monitoring of cardiac function is necessary.

5. Infection: The patient is on broad-s"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, cellulitis, and medical non-compliance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening COPD in the setting of medical non-compliance and continued smoking may lead to further respiratory failure. A chest CT shows concern for small pneumonia, and a CTA is negative for pulmonary embolism. The echo does not suggest heart failure, but the patient likely has high PCO2 at baseline.

2. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis is worsening over the past several months with chronic changes and infection. Blood cultures are negative so far. Antibiotics (Unasyn) will be given for a total of 14 days, along with wound care consult and redressings.

3. Medical Non-compliance: The patient has a history of medical non-compliance, which needs to be addressed with a social work consult once extubated.

4. Pressure Ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest and immobility.

5. Malnutrition: The patient may be at risk for malnutrition due to poor dentition and inability to eat properly.

6. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, cellulitis, depression, and medical non-compliance. She presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and lower extremity cellulitis. 

The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and other interventions. She was successfully extubated and her respiratory virus test came back negative, so droplet precautions were stopped. The patient also has an ear wax build-up and unable to visualize her tympanic membranes, so debrox was ordered.

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/65 mmHg to 150/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and liver enzymes. However, her blood glucose levels have been elevated on multiple occasions. Her creatinine and total CO2 levels are slightly elevated as well.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, likely due to worsening COPD and smoking. The chest CT scan is concerning for small pneumonia, but the computed tomography angiography (CTA) is negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). An echocardiogram does not suggest heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   74yo F with hx of COPD, cellulitis, depression, medical non-compliance
   who presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and LE cellulitis.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Likely represents worsening COPD in the setting
   of medical non-compliance and continued smoking.  Chest CT concerning
   for small PNA.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo does not suggest heart
   failure.  Likely high PCO2 at baseline (70-75% given HCO3).  Pt
   improving and extubated yesterday.  On 4L O2 which is likely close to
   baseline after reveiwing prior outpatient records.
   - Prednisone 40mg PO qday X 2 days, then steroid [**Year (4 digits) 458**] for next week
   - Change Unasyn to Augmentin for a total of 14 days (today is day [**5-11**])
   - f/u cultures, everything negative so far
   - start Spiriva and Advair inhalers today with PRN nebs
   .
   # Chest Pain: likely non-cardiac given history and no ECG changes
   however will cycle enzymes as this patient has multiple risk factors.
   ECG reassuring.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Ranitidine
   - cycle enzymes
   - start Aspirin 325mg PO qday
   .
   # Cellulitis: Worsening over past several months.  Likely chronic
   changes and infection.  Blood cultures thus far negative.
   - Abx as above Augmentin for a total of 14 days.
   - Wound care consult and redressings.
   - F/u cultures, thus far are negative
   .
   # Depression: Pt states she has a hx of depression.  Has taken
   Clonazepam 1mg PO qday for this.  Has never met with psychiatrist or
   therapist and is not interested in this.  No SI/HI.
   - continue Clonazepam
   - SW consult for depression and med non-compliance
   - outpatient f/u
   .
   # Elevated Blood Sugars: likely from steroid use.  Fingersticks in
   130s-150s range.  Receiving Glargine 8 units last night.
   - check HbA1C
   - as steroids [**Last Name (LF) 458**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] decrease glargine dose at night
   - continue to monitor sliding scale insulin requirements
   .
   #. Medical Non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # PPX: Heparin sc, H2 blocker, bowel regimen
   .
   #. FEN: Diabetic diet.  Replete lytes PRN.  Attempt to diurese slightly
   negative.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. This indicates worsening of COPD, possibly due to medical non-compliance and continued smoking. There is also a concern for small pulmonary embolism (PE) based on the chest CT, although the CTA is negative. The echo does not suggest heart failure. The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but has been successfully extubated and is now on 4L O2.

2. Chest pain: The patient is experiencing chest pain after eating breakfast, which she describes as heartburn. This could be indicative of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastritis. However, since the patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), it is important to rule out any cardiac causes. The ECG is reassuring with no changes.

3. Cellulitis: The patient has worsening cellulitis over the past several months, likely chronic changes and infection. Blood cultures thus far have been negative. The patient is currently on Augmentin for a total of 14 days and will receive wound care consult and redressings.

4. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is taking Clonazepam 1mg PO qday. She is not interested in seeing a psychiatrist or therapist and does not have any suicidal/homicidal thoughts"
