   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o female with multiple medical problems has:
   # Encephalopathy: In context of HTN similar to prior presentations.
   Exacerbated at this time by agitation [**1-31**] intubation and multiple doses
   of haldol/ativan given in emergency room.  Although presentation
   atypical, cannot rule out at this time epileptiform activity although
   her initial presentation is not suggestive of this (no witnessed
   seizure or seizure-like movements).  She has beeWe can also not rule
   out meningitis/encephalitis although again the patient does not have
   any laboratory evidence suggestive of these findings.  Exam is normal
   with exception of + Kernig's sign.  Head CT preliminary read negative.
   - Control BP as below
   - EEG/MRI this morning
   - LP this morning because mounted fever
   - Antibiotics started as could be infectious cause (sepsis vs
   meningitis): ampicillin, cefipime, vancomycin, and acyclovir
   - Consult neurology in AM regarding trileptal monitoring.
   .
   #Fever:possibly due to infection, was pan cultured.  Will do an LP this
   morning and started antibiotics this morning.
   - LP this morning
   - f/u pan cultures and CXR
   - antibiotics: ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and vanco all
   started [**2101-11-26**] in am.
   .
   # HTN: Patient was on nitroprusside drip started in ED and now on
   labetalol drip.  Currently hypertension improved with SBP in
   130-150range x several hours; combination of BP medication
   - Switch to labetolol drip given toxic metabolites of nitropruside
   - Restart home labetolol (600 TID)
   - Restart diovan at 160 [**Hospital1 7**] (Normally 320 QD)
   - Restart amlodipine (takes several days to work)
   - Will likely need to increase medications once propofol weaned.
   .
   # ESRD: Last HD on Wednesday.  Currently stable.  Continue nephrocaps,

She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and has been weaned off propofol since yesterday afternoon but is still not waking up. The patient spiked a fever of 102 degrees and was pan cultured. A lumbar puncture (LP) is planned for this morning.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/53 to 185/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and total bilirubin. The platelet count is slightly low. The sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels are within normal range. The calcium level is slightly low.

An imaging study reveals periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes, but no acute intracranial hemorrhage.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   62 y/o female ESRD and poorly controlled HTN presents w/ encephalopathy
   in the setting of severe HTN.  Problem list:
   # Encephalopathy: In context of HTN similar to prior presentations.
   This morning her mental status is much improved, though she remains
   mildly confused.  LP and CT were unimpressive for an acute process.
   She has not yet had an EEG or MRI.  Does not need meningitis
   medications, no clear signs of infection?
   Exacerbated at this time by agitation [**1-31**] intubation and multiple doses
   of haldol/ativan given in emergency room.  Although presentation
   atypical, cannot rule out at this time epileptiform activity although
   her initial presentation is not suggestive of this (no witnessed
   seizure or seizure-like movements).  She has beeWe can also not rule
   out meningitis/encephalitis although again the patient does not have
   any laboratory evidence suggestive of these findings.  Exam is normal
   with exception of + Kernig's sign.  Head CT preliminary read negative.
   - Control BP as below
   - EEG/MRI this morning
   - Antibiotics started as could be infectious cause (sepsis vs
   meningitis): ampicillin, cefipime, vancomycin, and acyclovir
   - Consult neurology in AM regarding trileptal monitoring.
   .
   #Fever:possibly due to infection, was pan cultured.  Will do an LP this
   morning and started antibiotics this morning.
   - LP this morning
   - f/u pan cultures and CXR
   - antibiotics: ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and vanco all
   started [**2101-11-26**] in am.
   .
   # HTN: back on home amlodipine, labetalol, valsartan and doxazosin.
   Patient unable to give a clear picture of what led to this worsening of
   her HTN.  Today we can increase her valsartan to 320.
   Patient was on nitroprusside drip started in ED and now on labetalol
   drip.  Currently hypertension improved with SBP in 130-150range x

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic hypertension, and poorly controlled blood pressure. She presents with altered mental status in the setting of severe hypertension. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is mildly confused, but much improved compared to previous presentations. Although the initial presentation does not suggest epileptiform activity or meningitis/encephalitis, these conditions cannot be completely ruled out. The presence of Kernig's sign raises suspicion for meningitis. Further evaluation with EEG and MRI is planned.

2. Fever: The patient has a temperature of 101.1°F, which could be due to an infection. Antibiotics have been started, and blood cultures are pending. Lumbar puncture (LP) will be performed to gather more information.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite multiple medications. Control of blood pressure is a priority, and adjustments to her current antihypertensive regimen are being made.

4. Chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and requires ongoing management. She recently had hemodialysis (HD) and is currently stable. Renal recommendations include continuing nephrocaps and renagel.

5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient is on lansoprazole for GERD management.

   Exacerbated at this time by agitation [**1-31**] intubation and multiple doses
   of haldol/ativan given in emergency room.  Although presentation
   atypical, cannot rule out at this time epileptiform activity although
   her initial presentation is not suggestive of this (no witnessed
   seizure or seizure-like movements).  She has beeWe can also not rule
   out meningitis/encephalitis although again the patient does not have
   any laboratory evidence suggestive of these findings.  Exam is normal
   with exception of + Kernig's sign.  Head CT preliminary read negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and poorly controlled hypertension. She presents with altered mental status, encephalopathy, and a possible seizure-like activity. The patient also has chronic renal failure, hypertension, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hypercholesterolemia, and fever.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), blood pressure ranging from 143/54 to 161/80 mmHg, heart rate between 66 and 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is extubated and awake.

The patient underwent several procedures, including a lumbar puncture, invasive ventilation, and blood culturing. She was started on various antibiotics such as ampicillin, cefepime, vancomycin, acyclovir, and later switched to ciprofloxacin. The patient also received treatment for Clostridium difficile infection with oral Flagyl.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The blood cultures are pending, as well as the results of the cerebrospinal fluid gram stain and culture.

The patient's imaging shows an improvement in congestive heart failure on the chest X-ray from the previous day. Microbiology tests revealed the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypertension, altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, and chronic renal failure. The patient has been extubated and is doing well off the ventilator. Blood pressure is under better control on home medications. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture, invasive ventilation, and blood cultures. Fever was noted at 101.1°F. The patient has multiple allergies and is currently on various antibiotics. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 156/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress and normal cardiovascular findings, although a systolic murmur is heard at the apex. Respiratory support is not required, and the patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented with mild confusion. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels. The patient's hemoglobin, platelet count, and glucose levels are within normal ranges. Other lab values indicate possible liver dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with ineffective coping, chronic renal failure, hypertension, altered mental status, and acute respiratory failure"
