 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   A/P: 55F with COPD, TBM, admitted with respiratory distress; with BiPAP
   requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, PE.  ALso
   metabolic acidosis from lactate as below likely to be contributing, as
   patient with poor respiratory reserve and unlikely to be able to
   satisfactorilly compensate from respiratory standpoint. Patient
   switched to aerosol mask last night, given ativan, now with worsening
   acidosis/hypercarbia--> will switch back to BiPAP.
   - Serial ABGs
   - sputum culture if able.  BAL if bronched. Urine legionella ag.
   - check flu/virals.
   - PE workup - D dimer 815; to either VQ (abnl CXR) or CTA (I- allergy)
   but may need.  Empiric heparin IV while undergoing workup.
   - BNP  374; gave IV lasix b/c appeared fluid overloaded as well; will
   evaluate pulm edema on CXR
   - IP aware, f/u recs.
   - Vanc azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP; consider broadening given
   recent steroids if febrile.
   - Consider intubation if acidosis though to be more related to WOB and
   need for rest, or if patient fatigues.
   - continue low dose steroids (hydrocort 25 Q8) given recent course and
   acute stressors.
   .
   # Tachycardia. Improved. Likely due to med effect (nebs) vs. sepsis vs.
   hypovolemia vs. PE.  On lopressor at baseline.
   - lopressor restarted
   - Infectious workup
   - Bolus 1 liter NS and further prn.
   .
   # Elevated lactate.  Seems to be maintaining perfusion with normal BPs,
   though tachycardic.  No evidence of bowel ischemia/abd benign.  No
   metformin use.  No risk factor for thiamine deficiency.  Presume
   hypoperfusion vs. significant work of breathing at this point, possibly
   more likely to hypoperfusion given improvement in lactates with fluids.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics at this point; add vanco and changing
   cipro to ceftriaxone as above.  Infectious workup.
   - LFTs and LDH wnl
   - Start thiamine 100 mg IV daily.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Resolved.  Likely lactic acidosis with very
   elevated lactate as above.  Also with small ketones in urine.
   - Bolus another liter NS.
   - D5 IVFs if prolonged NPO; insulin.
   .
   # Anisocoria.  Likely med effect from atrovent.
   - Continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia who was admitted with respiratory distress. She required BiPAP support, had tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. She was switched to an aerosol mask but experienced worsening acidosis/hypercarbia. The patient's medical history includes hypertension and recent steroid use. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 69-125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/81 mmHg to 195/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on BiPAP. 

Physical examination revealed marked anisocoria, elevated jugular venous pressure, bibasilar crackles in the chest, regular heart sounds without murmurs, and bilateral lower extremity edema with right calf tenderness. 

Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as elevated blood glucose and D-dimer. Other lab results were within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has significant tracheobronchomalacia and other types of COPD. The acute change includes possible COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. Metabolic acidosis from lactate is likely contributing to the respiratory distress. Serial ABGs, sputum"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). She was admitted with respiratory distress and required BiPAP support. The patient is experiencing tachycardia, elevated lactate levels, and metabolic acidosis. She also has anisocoria, bilateral lower extremity edema with calf tenderness, and poor respiratory effort. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, high glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin, lasix, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to exacerbation of COPD, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), or metabolic acidosis. Serial ABGs, sputum culture, and a PE workup should be done to identify the underlying cause. Empiric heparin IV should be given while undergoing the workup.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels suggest lactic acidosis, which could be related to poor respiratory reserve. Serial ABGs, fluid resuscitation, and evaluation for sepsis are necessary.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be caused by medication effects, sepsis, hypovolemia, or PE. Lopressor should be restarted, and"

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   A/P: 55F with COPD, TBM, admitted with respiratory distress; with BiPAP
   requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, PE.  ALso
   metabolic acidosis from lactate as below likely to be contributing, as
   patient with poor respiratory reserve and unlikely to be able to
   satisfactorily compensate from respiratory standpoint. Patient switched
   to aerosol mask last night, given ativan, now with worsening
   acidosis/hypercarbia--> will switch back to BiPAP.
   - Serial ABGs
   - sputum culture if able.  BAL if bronched. Urine legionella ag.
   - check flu/virals.
   - PE workup - D dimer 815; to either VQ (abnl CXR) or CTA (I- allergy)
   but may need.  Empiric heparin IV while undergoing workup.
   - BNP  374; gave IV lasix b/c appeared fluid overloaded as well; will
   evaluate pulm edema on CXR
   - IP aware, f/u recs.
   - Vanc azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP; consider broadening given
   recent steroids if febrile. Consider DC vanc tomorrow if clinically
   stable and no e/o GPCs in culture data
   - Consider intubation if acidosis though to be more related to WOB and
   need for rest, or if patient fatigues.
   - continue low dose steroids (hydrocort 25 Q8 yesterday) will wean to
   25 q 12h today and continue to wean c pred tomorrow
   .
   # Tachycardia. Improved. Likely due to med effect (nebs) vs. sepsis vs.
   hypovolemia vs. PE.  On lopressor at baseline.
   - lopressor restarted
   - Infectious workup
   - Bolus 1 liter NS and further prn.
   .
   # Elevated lactate.  Seems to be maintaining perfusion with normal BPs,
   though tachycardic.  No evidence of bowel ischemia/abd benign.  No
   metformin use.  No risk factor for thiamine deficiency.  Presume
   hypoperfusion vs. significant work of breathing at this point, possibly
   more likely to hypoperfusion given improvement in lactates with fluids.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics at this point; add vanco and changing
   cipro to ceftriaxone as above.  Infectious workup.
   - LFTs and LDH wnl
   - rec/d thiamine yesterday, but will dc today
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Resolved.  Likely lactic acidosis with very
   elevated lactate as above.  Also with small ketones in urine.
   - Bolus another liter NS.
   - D5 IVFs if prolonged NPO; insulin.
   .
   # Anisocoria.  Likely med effect from atrovent.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # LE pain and edema.
   - LENIs negative; improvement with lasix. will diurese PRN.
   .
   # FEN. NPO with NIPPV mask, sips prn.
   # Ppx. HSQ, H2B.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). She was admitted with respiratory distress and required BiPAP support. The patient also presented with tachycardia, elevated lactate levels, and metabolic acidosis. She was switched to an aerosol mask but experienced worsening acidosis/hypercarbia, so she was switched back to BiPAP. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's baseline significant TBM and unknown type of COPD increase the risk of respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism (PE). Serial ABGs, sputum culture, and PE workup are planned.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had an episode of resolved metabolic acidosis, likely lactic acidosis with elevated lactate levels. This could be due to significant work of breathing or hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of the patient's acid-base balance is necessary.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia improved but requires further evaluation. The potential causes include medication effects, sepsis, hypovolemia, or PE. Lopressor was restarted, and an infectious workup is pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with COPD, tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), and possibly other types of COPD, admitted with respiratory distress. The patient required BiPAP support, had tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's respiratory distress could be due to COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, or congestive heart failure (CHF). A VQ scan yesterday was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), and an echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) but borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient was able to get off 1.5 liters of oxygen in the past day and showed improvement in breathing. Lactic acid levels have normalized. The patient's ABG values are stable, and she is only requiring BiPAP support. 

The patient's sputum culture is pending, as well as a bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (BAL). Urine Legionella antigen and viral cultures are negative. Heparin drip was discontinued as the VQ scan was normal. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, suggesting possible diastolic CHF. The patient has already been diuresed 1.5 liters yesterday and will be diuresed additional liter today. Lasix will be started at a daily dose of 40 mg orally. The patient is aware of the possibility"

   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, CHF.  VQ
   scan yesterday negative for PE. Echo showed normal LVEF, but she did
   get 1.5 liters off in past day and has improved breathing; possible
   diastolic component. ALso metabolic acidosis from lactate was likely to
   be contributing, as patient with poor respiratory reserve and unlikely
   to be able to satisfactorily compensate from respiratory standpoint,
   but lactate has now normalized. Patient with stable ABG's only
   requiring BiPAP
   - sputum culture if able.  BAL if bronched. Urine legionella ag
   negative.
   - check flu/virals-preliminarily negative.
   - heparin drip d/c'ed as VQ scan normal
   - BNP  374; Normal LVEF, possible diastolic component. diuresed 1.5L

   - IP aware, f/u recs.
   - Vanc azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP; Still no sputum sample. Not
   febrile, Consider DC vanc todayif get sputum
   - Consider intubation if acidosis though to be more related to WOB and
   need for rest, or if patient fatigues.
   - continue low dose steroids -wean from hydrocort 25mg Q12 to
   prednisone 40mg daily today
   .
   # Elevated lactate. Resolved.  Presume hypoperfusion vs. significant
   work of breathing at this point, possibly more likely to hypoperfusion
   given improvement in lactates with fluids.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) admitted with respiratory distress. She required BiPAP support, had tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's ABGs have stabilized, and she is now only requiring BiPAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's baseline significant TBM and other type of COPD could lead to acute respiratory distress. Differential for acute change includes COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure (CHF).

2. Pneumonia: The patient may be at risk for developing pneumonia due to her compromised respiratory status and COPD.

3. CHF: The patient's symptoms could also be indicative of congestive heart failure, especially considering the presence of borderline pulmonary hypertension seen on the echocardiogram.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobility and the presence of central venous catheters, the patient is at risk for developing DVT.

5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: Given the patient's critical condition and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, stress ulcer prophylaxis should be considered to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.

6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She required BiPAP support and had elevated lactate levels, indicating possible metabolic acidosis. The patient's ABGs were stable, and she was diagnosed with diastolic heart failure based on a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram). She was diuresed 1.5 liters yesterday and will be diuresed an additional liter today. Lasix will be started PO daily. The patient is not a candidate for inpatient pulmonary stent placement due to infection risk. She has been advised to control GERD and undergo a sleep study. The patient was treated with vancomycin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but no sputum sample was obtained. The antibiotics will be discontinued, and azithromycin will be given for 5 days. The patient is also on a rapid taper of low-dose steroids. She is experiencing anxiety and may start an SSRI. Her current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), and a PPI. The patient is NPO with NIPPV mask, sips PRN, and is on a prophylactic regimen of SQ UF heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcers, and VAP."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) admitted for respiratory distress.
- She required BiPAP and had tachycardia along with elevated lactate levels.
- Initial assessment included respiratory distress, impaired skin integrity, and other conditions.
- Differential diagnosis included COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and metabolic acidosis.
- A VQ scan ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE), while an echocardiogram indicated diastolic CHF.
- The patient's metabolic acidosis was likely contributing to her respiratory distress, but has now normalized.
- She no longer requires BiPAP.
- Sputum culture, urine Legionella antigen, and viral cultures were negative, and she is on a five-day course of azithromycin.
- Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were high, suggesting diastolic CHF.
- The patient was diuresed 600cc yesterday and will receive an additional liter of diuretics along with starting a daily dose of Lasix PO.
- Daily weights will be trended.
- An intraoperative (IP) awareness assessment was performed, and the patient does not require a stent placement at this time.
- Recommendations include GERD control with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)"
