   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   .
   #COPD Exacerbation / resp acidosis/hemoptysis: Patient presumably
   desaturated secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing,
   aspiration and bronchospasm in the setting of  and elevated INR of
   3.8.  This acute aspiration paired with his poor baseline lung reserve
   with severe COPD & asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his
   hypoxia at OSH with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   mode.  Required bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday
   with evidence of RUL posterior segment bleed.  He has no leukocytosis
   or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is
   also in the differential as RLL on CT chest  with concerning
   consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   .
   - respiratory acidosis, increase RR to decrease carbon dioxide (watch
   out for auto-peep)
   - try to switch to PSV if tolerates
   - repeat ABG
   - try to wean down sedation
   - continue CTX / Vanco, start Azithromycin
   - prednisone PO 60mg, will taper slowly
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - place PPD and control to assess for Tb
   - RUL bronchoscopy for fungal , gram stain and cultures
   .
   #Anemia: Stable Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42-> 38-> 36 -> 31 now.
   Given dark NG lavage and small amount suctioned (20cc). While initial
   concern was for GI or nasopharyngeal source, bronch yesterday showed
   evidence of pulmonary bleed.  Etiology of hemoptysis may be due Strep
   PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis related lung
   disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also possible new
   malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at
   last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear masses to
   support this on CT.
   .
   - continue trending Hct  q6 hours
   - active T&S
   - supportive management
   - if Hct continues to decrease will contact IR for possible
   embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, anesthesia to
   possibly place double lumen tube in non-bleeding bronchus
   - if cont active hemoptysis place patient on right side
   - if continue to bleed reverse anticoagulation with FFP, hold heparin
   for now
   -guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   -consider GI scope if repeat NG suction with more bleeding
   -f/up final CT chest read
   -INR therapeutic at 2.1, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   -transfuse if Hct drops <30
   # hypotension: likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume
   loss (low urine output), cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia.  Holding
   home antihypotensives.
   - high autopeep and sepsis less likely etiologies
   - repeat ECHO
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - place arterial line, consider central line if pt does not improve
   with boluses and continuous pressure monitoring.
   .
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -trending ABGs as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   .
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - repeat EKG
   - TTE
   - continue tele monitoring
   .
   #HTN
 holding home meds [**3-11**] hypotension; d/ced lisinopril 5mg, lasix
   20mg
   .
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG.
   --holding Sotolol [**3-11**] hypotension

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to an acute COPD exacerbation and aspiration event. He was successfully intubated and is currently on assisted control mode ventilation (AC mode). He has evidence of right upper lobe posterior segment bleeding, which could be due to a pulmonary source such as Strep pneumoniae or complications from underlying asbestosis-related lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Another possible etiology could be a new malignancy, but there are no clear masses on the CT scan to support this.

The patient has stable anemia with a decreasing hematocrit (Hct) from 42% to 38% to 36% to 31%. The initial concern was for gastrointestinal (GI) or nasopharyngeal source, but bronchoscopy showed evidence of pulmonary bleed. The etiology of hemoptysis may be due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (Strep PNA) versus complications from underlying existing asbestosis-related lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also, possible new malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early [2199-6-7] at last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.

   #Anemia: Stable Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42-> 38-> 36 now. Given
   dark NG lavage and small amount suctioned (20cc). This GI collected
   blood may be secondary to ingested hempotysis source or from a
   nasopharyngeal /nosebleed in the setting of an elevated INR vs. true
   pulmonary source and overt hemoptysis.  Etiology of hemoptysis may be
   due Strep PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis
   related lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also
   possible new malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prior myocardial infarction (MI). The patient presented with respiratory distress and hemoptysis, which could be due to an acute COPD exacerbation or aspiration event. He was successfully intubated and is currently on assist-control ventilation (AC mode) with evidence of large clot suctioned from the right upper lobe (RUL) posterior segment, indicating a possible source of bleeding.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/48 mmHg to 169/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The physical examination reveals no conjunctival pallor, scleral icterus, or murmurs, but there is evidence of improved air movement from yesterday.

The laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 18.1 g/dL, and slightly elevated platelet count of 226 K/uL. The coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.7. Other lab values are within"

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   .
   #COPD Exacerbation / Hypoxia/hemoptysis: Patient presumably desaturated
   secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and
   bronchospasm in the setting of  hemoptysis vs. nasopharyngeal bleeding
   source w/aspiration( given elevated INR 3.8).  This acute aspiration
   paired with his poor baseline lung reserve with severe COPD &
   asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his hypoxia at OSH with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was successfully
   intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC mode.  Required
   bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday with evidence of He
   has no leukocytosis or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5
   range - but this is also in the differential as RLL on CT chest  with
   concerning consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   .
   - respiratory acidosis, increase RR to decrease carbon dioxide (watch
   out for auto-peep)
   - try to switch to PSV  if tolerates
   -repeat ABG
   - try to wean down sedation
   -continue CTX / Vanco/ Azithromycin
   -prednisone PO 60mg, will taper slowly
   -albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   .
   #Anemia: Stable Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42-> 38-> 36 -> 31 now.
   Given dark NG lavage and small amount suctioned (20cc). This GI
   collected blood may be secondary to ingested hempotysis source or from
   a nasopharyngeal /nosebleed in the setting of an elevated INR vs. true
   pulmonary source and overt hemoptysis.  Etiology of hemoptysis may be
   due Strep PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis
   related lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also
   possible new malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early
   [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear
   masses to support this on CT.   Bronchoscopy showed possible source of
   bleeding in posterior RUL
   .
   -continue trending Hct  q6 hours
   -active T&S
   - supportive management
   - if Hct continues to decrease will contact IR for possible
   embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, anesthesia to
   possibly place double lumen tube in non-bleeding bronchus
   -if cont active bleed place patient on right side
   -guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   -consider GI scope if repeat NG suction with more bleeding
   -f/up final CT chest read
   -INR therapeutic at 2.1, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   -transfuse if Hct drops <30
   # hypotension: likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume
   loss as patient has low urine output
   - high autopeep and sepsis less likely etiologies
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   .
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -trending ABGs as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen

   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with respiratory distress and hemoptysis.
- The patient required invasive ventilation and bronchoscopy for an obstructed airway and evaluation of hemoptysis.
- He is currently sedated on assist-control mode ventilation, with evidence of possible aspiration and a source of bleeding in the right upper lobe posterior segment.
- The patient's respiratory acidosis is being treated by increasing the respiratory rate to decrease carbon dioxide levels. There is a concern for auto-PEEP.
- The patient's anemia is stable, with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration from 42% to 31% over time. This may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or hempotysis.
- The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, including hypovolemia and acute blood loss.
- The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (MI), but no recent chest pain or ischemic changes on EKG.
- He has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, for which he was taking warfarin and sodolol. However, he is now in normal sinus rhythm.
- The patient's COPD exacerbation may have been caused by an acute event such as coughing, aspiration, or bronchospasm.
- Further evaluation and management are needed for the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   .
   #COPD Exacerbation / Hypoxia/hemoptysis: Patient presumably desaturated
   secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and
   bronchospasm in the setting of  hemoptysis vs. nasopharyngeal bleeding
   source w/aspiration( given elevated INR 3.8).  This acute aspiration
   paired with his poor baseline lung reserve with severe COPD &
   asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his hypoxia at OSH with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was successfully
   intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC mode.  Required
   bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday with evidence of He
   has no leukocytosis or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5
   range - but this is also in the differential as RLL on CT chest  with
   concerning consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   .
   - respiratory acidosis, increase RR to decrease carbon dioxide (watch
   out for auto-peep)
   - try to switch to PSV  if tolerates
   -repeat ABG
   - try to wean down sedation
   -continue CTX / Vanco/ Azithromycin
   -prednisone PO 60mg, will taper slowly
   -albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - place PPD and control to assess for Tb
   - RUL bronchoscopy for fungal , gram stain and cultures
   .
   #Anemia: Stable Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42-> 38-> 36 -> 31 now.
   Given dark NG lavage and small amount suctioned (20cc). This GI
   collected blood may be secondary to ingested hempotysis source or from
   a nasopharyngeal /nosebleed in the setting of an elevated INR vs. true
   pulmonary source and overt hemoptysis.  Etiology of hemoptysis may be
   due Strep PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis
   related lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also
   possible new malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early
   [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear
   masses to support this on CT.   Bronchoscopy showed possible source of
   bleeding in posterior RUL [**3-11**] bronchiectesis
   .
   -continue trending Hct  q6 hours
   -active T&S
   - supportive management
   - if Hct continues to decrease will contact IR for possible
   embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, anesthesia to
   possibly place double lumen tube in non-bleeding bronchus
   -if cont active hemoptysis place patient on right side
   - if continue to bleed reverse anticoagulation
   -guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   -consider GI scope if repeat NG suction with more bleeding
   -f/up final CT chest read
   -INR therapeutic at 2.1, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   -transfuse if Hct drops <30
   # hypotension: likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume
   loss (low urine output), cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia
   - high autopeep and sepsis less likely etiologies
   - repeat ECHO
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - place arterial line, possibly central line
   .
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -trending ABGs as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   .
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   --holding ASA for now given bleeding
   --repeat EKG
   -TTE
   --continue tele monitoring

","Summary:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease who presented with respiratory failure and hemoptysis.
- He was intubated and placed on assisted mechanical ventilation due to an acute COPD exacerbation and hypoxia.
- A bronchoscopy revealed a possible source of bleeding in the right upper lobe posterior segment.
- The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume loss, cardiac dysfunction, and bradycardia.
- His urine output has been low, and he has anemia with a decreasing hematocrit level.
- The etiology of the hemoptysis is still uncertain but could be due to Streptococcal pneumonia, complications from underlying asbestosis-related lung disease, or a new malignancy.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and hematological status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Barotrauma or airway injury due to high peak inspiratory pressures
- Auto-PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) leading to breath stacking and hemodynamic instability

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
- Cardiogenic shock due to acute volume loss and cardiac dysfunction
- Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and prior myocardial infarction. He presented with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hemoptysis, which was likely due to an aspiration event in the setting of a possible nasopharyngeal bleeding source. The patient has been intubated and is currently on assisted controlled ventilation mode with good oxygenation. He is also on sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: There is concern for pneumonia, indicated by leukocytosis, fever, and consolidation seen on the CT chest. The patient may require broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential pathogens.
2. Acute COPD Exacerbation: The patient's acute respiratory distress could be related to an exacerbation of his underlying COPD. Management should include bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels have been dropping steadily, suggesting anemia. This could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding from aspirated blood or a true pulmonary source of bleeding.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic boots should be continued.
5. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer bleeding, especially given his elevated IN"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be multifactorial,
   including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneuonia,
   hemoptysis, CHF on background of asbestos-related lung disease.
   Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to endobronchial blood
   clot that may have obstructed central airway --> resp. distress.  Plan
   maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Treat infection.  Work
   towards SBT.
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- may be hypovolemia, but more concerning for sepsis
   (persistent, no obvious blood loss, and background of HTN -- now
   holding anti-HTN meds).  Doubt MI, adrenal insufficiency.  Plan
   continue to support to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Consider central line
   and vasopressors as needed.  Cardiac Echo.  Assess cardiac enzymes.
   COUGHING BLOOD -- likely hemoptysis based on bronchoscopy finding.
   Suspect RUL (post) source, suspect bronchiecatasis.  Consider
   mycobacterial disease.  Limited blood through endotracheal tube.
   Monitor clinically.  Plan repeat bronchscopy for micro (including AFB).
   Check PPD with controls.
   PNEUMONIA
 Perhaps pneumonia or bronchietasis.  Ceftriaxone, Vanco,
   Azithro.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   HYPONATREMIA -- unclear duration.  Resolved with NS.  Monitor Na.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   be due to lung disease or pneumonia.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin.  Monitor PT.
   CAD -- no evidence for acute MI.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Replete with NS.
   A-FIB -- monitor HR.  Anticoagulation, monitor INR.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- iniitate TF

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear and may be multifactorial, including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, hemoptysis, and congestive heart failure on a background of asbestos-related lung disease. The patient requires mechanical ventilation and monitoring of ABG. Infection should be treated, and efforts towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) should be made.

The patient also has hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. Vasopressors and central line placement may be necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. A cardiac echo and assessment of cardiac enzymes are recommended.

The patient has been coughing up blood, likely hemoptysis, with a suspected right upper lobe source. Bronchiectasis and mycobacterial disease should be considered. Repeated bronchoscopic evaluation for microbiological testing, including acid-fast bacilli (AFB), is planned.

The patient has anemia, possibly due to hemoptysis and ecchymosis, exacerbated by anticoagulation. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is clinically stable, and transfusion to an Hct of greater than 27% is advised.

Hyponatremia has resolved with normal saline (NS) administration, and sodium levels should be monitored. Coagulopathy is attributed to coumad"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be multifactorial,
   including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneuonia,
   hemoptysis, CHF on background of asbestos-related lung disease.
   Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to endobronchial blood
   clot that may have obstructed central airway --> resp. distress.  Plan
   maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Treat infection.  Work
   towards SBT.
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- may be hypovolemia, but more concerning for sepsis
   (persistent, no obvious blood loss, and background of HTN -- now
   holding anti-HTN meds).  Doubt MI, adrenal insufficiency.  Plan
   continue to support to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Consider central line
   and vasopressors as needed.  Cardiac Echo.  Assess cardiac enzymes.
   COUGHING BLOOD -- likely hemoptysis based on bronchoscopy finding.
   Suspect RUL (post) source, suspect bronchiecatasis.  Consider
   mycobacterial disease.  Limited blood through endotracheal tube.
   Monitor clinically.  Plan repeat bronchscopy for micro (including AFB).
   Check PPD with controls.
   PNEUMONIA
 Perhaps pneumonia or bronchietasis.  Ceftriaxone, Vanco,
   Azithro.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   HYPONATREMIA -- unclear duration.  Resolved with NS.  Monitor Na.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   be due to lung disease or pneumonia.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin.  Monitor PT.
   CAD -- no evidence for acute MI.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Replete with NS.
   A-FIB -- monitor HR.  Anticoagulation, monitor INR.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- iniitate TF

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient experienced hypotensive episodes overnight, requiring IV fluid boluses. Propofol was discontinued due to hypotension, and versed and fentanyl were started. The patient has a history of respiratory failure with unclear etiology, suspected to be multifactorial including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, hemoptysis, and CHF on a background of asbestos-related lung disease. The patient also has hypotension, coughing blood (likely hemoptysis), anemia, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and CAD. Fluids have been repleted with NS, and the patient is being monitored closely for various conditions. The patient is critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to an unclear etiology, but suspected to be multifactorial. It is important to monitor ABG and work towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. It is crucial to continue supporting the patient's blood pressure to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg. Central line and vasopressors may be considered as needed.
3. Hemoptysis: The patient is coughing blood, likely due to hemoptysis."

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMOPTYSIS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation / resp acidosis/hemoptysis: Patient presumably
   desaturated secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing,
   aspiration and bronchospasm in the setting of  and elevated INR of
   3.8.  This acute aspiration paired with his poor baseline lung reserve
   with severe COPD & asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his
   hypoxia at OSH with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   mode.  Required bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday
   with evidence of RUL posterior segment bleed.  He has no leukocytosis
   or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is
   also in the differential as RLL on CT chest with concerning
   consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   - continue mechanical ventilation on CMV500/18/5/40%.  Monitor ABG and
   switch to PS when pt can clinically tolerate it.
   - ABG q am and 1 hour vent change
   - minimize sedation to help with hypotension, SBT today or tomorrow
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, 8-day course total
   - Decrease Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (from 60mg), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - f/u on ppd and [**Female First Name (un) **] antigen
   - f/u BAL and cx
   #Anemia: Stable overnight.  Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42-> 38->
   36 -> 31 now s/p 1 unit PRBCs with hct 32.4 post xfusion to 31.5
   overnight.  Initial concern for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of
   clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**]. Etiology of hemoptysis may be due
   Strep PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis related
   lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also possible new
   malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at
   last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear masses to
   support this on CT.
   - continue trending Hct q8 hours, T&S active
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <30
   - if continue to bleed reverse anticoagulation with FFP, hold heparin
   for now
   -guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   -consider GI scope if repeat NG suction with more bleeding
   -f/up final CT chest read
   -INR therapeutic at 2.1, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   - if Hct continues to decrease will contact IR for possible
   embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, anesthesia to
   possibly place double lumen tube in non-bleeding bronchus
   - if cont active hemoptysis place patient on right side
   # hypotension: likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume
   loss (low urine output), cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia.  Holding
   home antihypotensives.  High autopeep and sepsis less likely etiologies
   - wean sedation to help raise BP
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - consider pressors if continues
   #Bradycardia: Pt bradycardic despite being hypotensive.  Possibilty of
   primary cardiac cause.  Echo and EKG completed.
   - wean sedation
   - Continue to monitor
   - consider transcutaneous pacing and/or atropine if unable to maintain
   pressure with bradycardia
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -trending ABGs as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - continue tele monitoring
   #HTN
 d/ced lisinopril 5mg, lasix 20mg
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis versus gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient has been intubated and is currently comfortable on assist-control (AC) mode ventilation. He required a bronch for an obstruction/evaluation of hemoptysis yesterday and showed evidence of right upper lobe posterior segment bleed. There are no leukocytosis or reports of fevers to support pneumonia (PNA), but lactate levels are within the normal range. The patient also has right lower lobe consolidation on CT chest, which could be due to aspiration-related changes or pneumonia.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hemoptysis: The etiology of hemoptysis may be due to Streptococcal PNA or complications from underlying asbestosis-related lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also, possible new malignancy (recently losing weight) is a consideration, but there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
- Continue mechanical ventilation on CMV 500/18/5/40%.
- Monitor ABG and switch to pressure support (PS) when the patient can clinically tolerate it.
- ABG q am and 1-hour vent change.
- Minimize sedation to help"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMOPTYSIS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation / resp acidosis/hemoptysis: Patient presumably
   desaturated secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing,
   aspiration and bronchospasm in the setting of  and elevated INR of
   3.8.  This acute aspiration paired with his poor baseline lung reserve
   with severe COPD & asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his
   hypoxia at OSH with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   mode.  Required bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday
   with evidence of RUL posterior segment bleed.  He has no leukocytosis
   or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is
   also in the differential as RLL on CT chest with concerning
   consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   - continue mechanical ventilation on CMV500/18/5/40%.  Monitor ABG and
   switch to PS when pt can clinically tolerate it.
   - ABG q am and 1 hour vent change
   - minimize sedation to help with hypotension, SBT today or tomorrow
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, 8-day course total
   - Decrease Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (from 60mg), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - f/u on ppd and [**Female First Name (un) **] antigen
   - f/u BAL and cx
   #Anemia: Stable overnight.  Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42-> 38->
   36 -> 31 now s/p 1 unit PRBCs with hct 32.4 post xfusion to 31.5
   overnight.  Initial concern for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of
   clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**]. Etiology of hemoptysis may be due
   Strep PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis related
   lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also possible new
   malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at
   last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear masses to
   support this on CT.
   - continue trending Hct q8 hours, T&S active
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <30
   - if continue to bleed reverse anticoagulation with FFP, hold heparin
   for now
   -guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   -consider GI scope if repeat NG suction with more bleeding
   -f/up final CT chest read
   -INR therapeutic at 2.1, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   - if Hct continues to decrease will contact IR for possible
   embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, anesthesia to
   possibly place double lumen tube in non-bleeding bronchus
   - if cont active hemoptysis place patient on right side
   # hypotension: likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume
   loss (low urine output), cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia.  Holding
   home antihypotensives.  High autopeep and sepsis less likely etiologies
   - wean sedation to help raise BP
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - consider pressors if continues
   #Bradycardia: Pt bradycardic despite being hypotensive.  Possibilty of
   primary cardiac cause.  Echo and EKG completed.
   - wean sedation
   - Continue to monitor
   - consider transcutaneous pacing and/or atropine if unable to maintain
   pressure with bradycardia
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: Patient with decreased UOP, however creatinine
   and BUN normal.
   - UA, urine lytes, urine eosiniphils
   - monitor UOP
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -trending ABGs as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - continue tele monitoring
   #HTN
 d/ced lisinopril 5mg, lasix 20mg
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe COPD, and coronary artery disease who presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis versus GI bleed. He was successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on assist control mode. The patient has no leukocytosis or report of fevers to support pneumonia, but lactate levels are elevated. There is evidence of right upper lobe posterior segment bleed. The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, and he requires aggressive fluid resuscitation with blood products. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure of 103/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation on CMV 500/18/5/40%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and recent hypoxic episode indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of ABG and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.

2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, including hypovolemia, acute blood loss, cardiac dysfunction, and bradycardia. Close monitoring of vital signs and aggressive fluid resuscitation with blood products are required. If hypotension persists, the consideration of pressors may be necessary.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe COPD, and coronary artery disease who presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis versus gastrointestinal bleed. He was intubated due to acute respiratory failure and is now comfortable on assist control mode. He required bronchoscopic evaluation for obstruction/evaluation of hemoptysis yesterday, revealing a right upper lobe posterior segment bleed. There is no leukocytosis or report of fevers to support pneumonia, and lactate levels are within normal range.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient has evidence of pulmonary bleed, possibly due to Streptococcal pneumonia or complications from underlying asbestosis-related lung disease. Other potential causes include new malignancy or complications from existing lung disease. Close monitoring of Hct is recommended, and if it continues to decrease, consideration should be given to interventional radiology for possible embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, or placement of a double lumen tube in the non-bleeding bronchus.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, including hypovolemia, acute volume loss, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia, and possible sepsis. Supportive management with fluid boluses and continuous pressure monitoring is advised. Repeat echocardiogram may be helpful, and R"

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation / resp acidosis/hemoptysis: Patient presumably
   desaturated secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing,
   aspiration and bronchospasm in the setting of  and elevated INR of
   3.8.  This acute aspiration paired with his poor baseline lung reserve
   with severe COPD & asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his
   hypoxia at OSH with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   mode.  Required bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday
   with evidence of RUL posterior segment bleed.  He has no leukocytosis
   or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is
   also in the differential as RLL on CT chest with concerning
   consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe COPD, and coronary artery disease. He presents with hypoxia and hemoptysis, which were likely caused by an acute exacerbation of COPD, aspiration, and bronchospasm. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also has a right upper lobe posterior segment bleed, possibly due to a lung infection or underlying lung disease such as asbestosis. There is no evidence of pneumonia or leukocytosis, but there is concern for right lower lobe consolidation or aspiration-related changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and recent acute exacerbation put him at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ABGs and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient has ongoing hemoptysis, which could be due to the right upper lobe bleed or other causes. Further evaluation and management are needed to control the bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing, indicating anemia. Close monitoring of Hct levels and consideration of blood transfusions may be required.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, involving hypovolemia, acute blood loss, cardiac dysfunction, and possible sepsis. Supportive management with fluid boluses and monitoring of vital signs are essential.
5. Cardiac dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMOPTYSIS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation / resp acidosis/hemoptysis: Patient presumably
   desaturated secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing,
   aspiration and bronchospasm in the setting of  and elevated INR of
   3.8.  This acute aspiration paired with his poor baseline lung reserve
   with severe COPD & asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his
   hypoxia at OSH with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   mode.  Required bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday
   with evidence of RUL posterior segment bleed.  He has no leukocytosis
   or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is
   also in the differential as RLL on CT chest  with concerning
   consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   .
   - continue mechanical ventilation on CMV500/18/5/40%.  Monitor ABG and
   switch to PS when pt can clinically tolerate it.
   - ABG qam and 1 hour vent change
   - minimize sedation to help with hypotension
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin
   - Decrease Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday (from 60mg)
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.

   36 -> 31 now s/p 1 unit PRBCs with hct 32.4 post xfusion to 31.5
   overnight.  Initial concern for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of
   clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**]. Etiology of hemoptysis may be due
   Strep PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis related
   lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also possible new
   malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at
   last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear masses to
   support this on CT.
   - continue trending Hct  q6 hours
   - active T&S
   -
   - if Hct continues to decrease will contact IR for possible
   embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, anesthesia to
   possibly place double lumen tube in non-bleeding bronchus
   - if cont active hemoptysis place patient on right side
   - if continue to bleed reverse anticoagulation with FFP, hold heparin
   for now
   -guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   -consider GI scope if repeat NG suction with more bleeding
   -f/up final CT chest read
   -INR therapeutic at 2.1, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   -transfuse if Hct drops <30
   # hypotension: likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume
   loss (low urine output), cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia.  Holding
   home antihypotensives.
   - high autopeep and sepsis less likely etiologies
   - repeat ECHO
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - place arterial line, consider central line if pt does not improve
   with boluses and continuous pressure monitoring.

   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe COPD, and coronary artery disease. He presented with a hypoxic episode and hemoptysis, likely due to acute COPD exacerbation and aspiration. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension and a hypertrophied, dilated right ventricle. There is evidence of right lower lobe consolidation, which could be pneumonia or aspiration-related changes. The patient's anemia is stable, but there has been a decrease in hemoglobin concentration overnight, possibly due to GI bleed or ongoing hemoptysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and recent acute exacerbation put him at risk for ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The right lower lobe consolidation on CT chest could indicate pneumonia, which may require antibiotic treatment.
3. Aspiration Pneumonitis: Aspiration during the hypoxic episode can lead to lung injury and inflammation.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's severe pulmonary hypertension could worsen, leading to further right ventricular strain and potential cardiac dysfunction.
5. GI Bleed: The decrease in hemoglobin concentration suggests possible GI bleed, which needs to be evaluated and managed accordingly.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of consolidation and potential infection.
7. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be multifactorial,
   including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneuonia,
   hemoptysis, CHF on background of asbestos-related lung disease.
   Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to endobronchial blood
   clot that may have obstructed central airway --> resp. distress.  Plan
   maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Treat infection.  Work
   towards SBT.
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- may be hypovolemia, but more concerning for sepsis
   (persistent, no obvious blood loss, and background of HTN -- now
   holding anti-HTN meds).  Doubt MI, adrenal insufficiency.  Plan
   continue to support to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Consider vasopressors as
   needed.
   COUGHING BLOOD -- likely hemoptysis based on bronchoscopy finding.
   Suspect RUL (post) source, suspect bronchiecatasis.  Consider
   mycobacterial disease.  Limited blood through endotracheal tube.
   Monitor clinically.  Plan repeat bronchscopy for micro (including AFB).
   Check PPD with controls.
   PNEUMONIA
 Perhaps pneumonia or bronchietasis.  Ceftriaxone, Vanco,
   Azithro.
   BRADYCARDIA -- likely intrinsic lung disease, possible vagal
   stimulation or pharmachological effects.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   OLIGURIA
 assess for proper catheter function.
   HYPONATREMIA -- unclear duration.  Resolved with NS.  Monitor Na.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   be due to lung disease or pneumonia.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin.  Monitor PT.
   CAD -- no evidence for acute MI.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Replete with NS.
   A-FIB -- monitor HR.  Anticoagulation, monitor INR.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- iniitate TF

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be multifactorial,
   including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneuonia,
   hemoptysis, CHF on background of asbestos-related lung disease.
   Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to endobronchial blood
   clot that may have obstructed central airway --> resp. distress.  Plan
   maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Treat infection.  Work
   towards SBT.
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- may be hypovolemia, but more concerning for sepsis
   (persistent, no obvious blood loss, and background of HTN -- now
   holding anti-HTN meds).  Doubt MI, adrenal insufficiency.  Plan
   continue to support to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Consider vasopressors as
   needed.
   COUGHING BLOOD -- likely hemoptysis based on bronchoscopy finding.
   Suspect RUL (post) source, suspect bronchiecatasis.  Consider
   mycobacterial disease.  Limited blood through endotracheal tube.
   Monitor clinically.  Plan repeat bronchscopy for micro (including AFB).
   Await PPD with controls.
   PNEUMONIA
 Perhaps pneumonia or bronchietasis.  Ceftriaxone, Vanco,
   Azithro.
   BRADYCARDIA -- likely intrinsic lung disease, possible vagal
   stimulation or pharmachological effects.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   OLIGURIA
 assess for proper catheter function.
   HYPONATREMIA -- unclear duration.  Resolved with NS.  Monitor Na.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   be due to lung disease or pneumonia.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin.  Monitor PT.
   CAD -- no evidence for acute MI.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Replete with NS.
   A-FIB -- monitor HR.  Anticoagulation, monitor INR.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- iniitate TF

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have been diagnosed with respiratory failure, with an unclear etiology. Possible causes include COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, hemoptysis, and CHF on a background of asbestos-related lung disease.

The patient also has hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. There are concerns about potential sources of bleeding, such as bronchiectasis or mycobacterial disease. Pneumonia is also suspected, and antibiotics have been initiated.

The patient is experiencing bradycardia, likely due to intrinsic lung disease, possible vagal stimulation, or pharmacological effects. Anemia is present, possibly due to hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE trauma), as well as anticoagulation. Oliguria is present, and proper catheter function needs to be assessed. Hyponatremia has resolved with normal saline, and oliguria is suspected to be due to lung disease or pneumonia.

Coagulopathy is attributed to coumadin, and cardiac enzymes are being monitored for possible CAD. Fluids have been administered to address hypovolemia. The patient is also being monitored for atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation.

Nutritional support has been initiated, and glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has multiple lines, including arterial and central lines. Prophylaxis for DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMOPTYSIS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation / resp acidosis/hemoptysis: Patient presumably
   desaturated secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing,
   aspiration and bronchospasm in the setting of  and elevated INR of
   3.8.  This acute aspiration paired with his poor baseline lung reserve
   with severe COPD & asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his
   hypoxia at OSH with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   mode.  Required bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday
   with evidence of RUL posterior segment bleed.  He has no leukocytosis
   or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is
   also in the differential as RLL on CT chest with concerning
   consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   - continue mechanical ventilation on CMV500/18/5/40%.  Monitor ABG and
   switch to PS when pt can clinically tolerate it.
   - ABG q am and 1 hour vent change
   - minimize sedation to help with hypotension, SBT today or tomorrow
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, 8-day course total
   - Decrease Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (from 60mg), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - f/u on ppd and [**Female First Name (un) **] antigen
   - f/u BAL and cx
   #Anemia: Stable overnight.  Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42-> 38->
   36 -> 31 now s/p 1 unit PRBCs with hct 32.4 post xfusion to 31.5
   overnight.  Initial concern for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of
   clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**]. Etiology of hemoptysis may be due
   Strep PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis related
   lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also possible new
   malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at
   last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear masses to
   support this on CT.
   - continue trending Hct q8 hours, T&S active
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <30
   - if continue to bleed reverse anticoagulation with FFP, hold heparin
   for now
   -guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   -consider GI scope if repeat NG suction with more bleeding
   -f/up final CT chest read
   -INR therapeutic at 2.1, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   - if Hct continues to decrease will contact IR for possible
   embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, anesthesia to
   possibly place double lumen tube in non-bleeding bronchus
   - if cont active hemoptysis place patient on right side
   # hypotension: likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume
   loss (low urine output), cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia.  Holding
   home antihypotensives.  High autopeep and sepsis less likely etiologies
   - wean sedation to help raise BP
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - consider pressors if continues
   #Bradycardia: Pt bradycardic despite being hypotensive.  Possibilty of
   primary cardiac cause.  Echo and EKG completed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous myocardial infarction. He presents with a new hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis or gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was successfully intubated and is now comfortable on assist-control (AC) ventilation mode. He requires a bronchoscopic evaluation for obstruction and assessment of hemoptysis. There is no evidence of leukocytosis or fever to support pneumonia, but lactate levels are elevated, suggesting possible sepsis. A CT chest reveals right lower lobe consolidation, which may indicate aspiration-related changes or pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and acute respiratory failure put him at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ABGs and ventilator settings will be necessary.
2. Sepsis: Elevated lactate levels and right lower lobe consolidation suggest a possible infection. Sepsis should be considered, and appropriate antibiotics should be initiated.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, acute blood loss, cardiac dysfunction, or sepsis. Close monitoring and fluid resuscitation will be required. Pressors may be needed if the patient remains hypotensive.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMOPTYSIS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation / resp acidosis/hemoptysis: Patient presumably
   desaturated secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing,
   aspiration and bronchospasm in the setting of  and elevated INR of
   3.8.  This acute aspiration paired with his poor baseline lung reserve
   with severe COPD & asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his
   hypoxia at OSH with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   mode.  Required bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday
   with evidence of RUL posterior segment bleed.  He has no leukocytosis
   or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is
   also in the differential as RLL on CT chest with concerning
   consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   - continue mechanical ventilation on CMV500/18/5/40% - attempt PS today
   once sedation weaned.
   - ABG q am and 1 hour vent change
   - Sedation to midazolam drip with fentanyl bolus to minimize blood
   pressure lability and bradycardia while attempting to decrease
   sedation.
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, Day 4 ot 8-day course total
   - Decrease Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (from 60mg), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - PPD negative and BAL negative AFB x1, repeat mini BAL with AFB x 2.
   - f/u other BAL and cx
   #Anemia: Remailns stable at 31.3.  Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42->
   38-> 36 -> 31 ---> 31.3. Initial concern for GI bleed now decreased s/p
   clearance of clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**]. Etiology of
   hemoptysis may be due Strep PNA vs. asbestosis related lung disease,
   although this would be quite atypical. Also possible new malignancy
   (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last
   cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear masses to support
   this on CT.
   - Trend Hct daily T&S active
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <30
   - if continue to bleed reverse anticoagulation with FFP, hold heparin
   for now
   - guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   - INR therapeutic at 3.0, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   # hypotension/blood pressure lability: hypotension improves with
   decreased sedation and removal of fentanyl, however becomes
   hypertensive off sedation.  Likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia,
   cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia.  Holding home antihypotensives.
   Avoid anti-hypertensives at this point due to episode of hypotension
   yesterday with captopril.
   - continue sedation with midazolam with fentanyl bolus
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: Pt bradycardic despite being hypotensive.  Possibilty of
   primary cardiac cause or reaction to fentanyl.  Echo and EKG completed.
   - wean sedation
   - Continue to monitor
   - consider transcutaneous pacing and/or atropine if unable to maintain
   pressure with bradycardia
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: Patient with decreased UOP, however creatinine
   and BUN normal. FENA = .04%, likely pre-renal with possible
   hypovolemia, however due to normal creatinine, FENA not as indicitive
   of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.

 HEMOPTYSIS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation / resp acidosis/hemoptysis: Patient presumably
   desaturated secondary to acute COPD exacerbation from coughing,
   aspiration and bronchospasm in the setting of  and elevated INR of
   3.8.  This acute aspiration paired with his poor baseline lung reserve
   with severe COPD & asbestosis related lung disease likely produced his
   hypoxia at OSH with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   mode.  Required bronch for obstruction/eval of hemoptosis yesterday
   with evidence of RUL posterior segment bleed.  He has no leukocytosis
   or report of fevers to support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is
   also in the differential as RLL on CT chest with concerning
   consolidation vs. aspiration related changes.
   - continue mechanical ventilation on CMV500/18/5/40%.  Monitor ABG and
   switch to PS when pt can clinically tolerate it.
   - ABG q am and 1 hour vent change
   - minimize sedation to help with hypotension, SBT today or tomorrow
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, 8-day course total
   - Decrease Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (from 60mg), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - f/u on ppd and [**Female First Name (un) **] antigen
   - f/u BAL and cx
   #Anemia: Stable overnight.  Hct drop between [**Date range (1) 8478**] from 42-> 38->
   36 -> 31 now s/p 1 unit PRBCs with hct 32.4 post xfusion to 31.5
   overnight.  Initial concern for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of
   clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**]. Etiology of hemoptysis may be due
   Strep PNA vs. complications from underlying existing asbestosis related
   lung disease, although this would be quite atypical. Also possible new
   malignancy (recently losing weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at
   last cardiology appointment), however, there are no clear masses to
   support this on CT.
   - continue trending Hct q8 hours, T&S active
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <30
   - if continue to bleed reverse anticoagulation with FFP, hold heparin
   for now
   -guiac all stools
   -continue IV Protonix [**Hospital1 7**] for GI source coverage
   -consider GI scope if repeat NG suction with more bleeding
   -f/up final CT chest read
   -INR therapeutic at 2.1, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   - if Hct continues to decrease will contact IR for possible
   embolization, surgery for possible emergent thoracotomy, anesthesia to
   possibly place double lumen tube in non-bleeding bronchus
   - if cont active hemoptysis place patient on right side
   # hypotension: likely multifactorial due to hypovolemia, acute volume
   loss (low urine output), cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia.  Holding
   home antihypotensives.  High autopeep and sepsis less likely etiologies
   - wean sedation to help raise BP
   - supportive management with fluid boluses
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - consider pressors if continues
   #Bradycardia: Pt bradycardic despite being hypotensive.  Possibilty of
   primary cardiac cause.  Echo and EKG completed.
   - wean sedation
   - Continue to monitor
   - consider transcutaneous pacing and/or atropine if unable to maintain
   pressure with bradycardia
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: Patient with decreased UOP, however creatinine
   and BUN normal.
   - UA, urine lytes, urine eosiniphils
   - monitor UOP
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -trending ABGs as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - continue tele monitoring
   #HTN
 d/ced lisinopril 5mg, lasix 20mg
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG.

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis or gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was successfully intubated and is now comfortable on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and asbestosis-related lung disease, which makes him at high risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG) and adjusting ventilator settings accordingly are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and increased lactate levels, which may indicate an infection such as pneumonia. Further investigation with bronchoscopy and cultures is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Aspiration: Given the patient's acute COPD exacerbation and poor baseline lung reserve, there is a risk of further aspiration events. Close monitoring and minimizing sedation can help in assessing the patient's ability to protect their own airway.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Frequent trending of hemoglobin levels, transfusing if necessary, and evaluating the cause of bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal source) are important.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may be due to hypovolem"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be multifactorial,
   including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneuonia,
   hemoptysis, CHF on background of asbestos-related lung disease.
   Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to endobronchial blood
   clot that may have obstructed central airway --> resp. distress.  Plan
   maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Treat infection.  Work
   towards SBT.
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- may be hypovolemia, but more concerning for sepsis
   (persistent, no obvious blood loss, and background of HTN -- now
   holding anti-HTN meds).  Doubt MI, adrenal insufficiency.  Plan
   continue to support to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Consider vasopressors as
   needed.
   COUGHING BLOOD -- likely hemoptysis based on bronchoscopy finding.
   Suspect RUL (post) source, suspect bronchiecatasis.  Consider
   mycobacterial disease.  Limited blood through endotracheal tube.
   Monitor clinically.  Plan repeat bronchscopy for micro (including AFB).
   Await PPD with controls.
   PNEUMONIA
 Perhaps pneumonia or bronchietasis.  Ceftriaxone, Vanco,
   Azithro.
   BRADYCARDIA -- likely intrinsic lung disease, possible vagal
   stimulation or pharmachological effects.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   OLIGURIA
 assess for proper catheter function.
   HYPONATREMIA -- unclear duration.  Resolved with NS.  Monitor Na.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   be due to lung disease or pneumonia.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin.  Monitor PT.
   CAD -- no evidence for acute MI.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Replete with NS.
   A-FIB -- monitor HR.  Anticoagulation, monitor INR.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- iniitate TF

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of pain. The patient has ecchymosis of the left foot, pretibial region (unchanged since admission).

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, platelet count of 222 K/uL, blood glucose of 146 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride of 107 mEq/L. The patient's INR is 3.0, PTT is 36.8 seconds, and PT is 29.9 seconds.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, which may be multifactorial and possibly related to COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, hemoptysis, congestive heart failure (CHF) on a background of asbestos-related lung disease. The plan is to maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor arterial blood gases (ABG), treat infection, and work towards spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

The patient also has hypotension, likely due to hypovolemia or sepsis. The plan is to support blood pressure and consider vasopressors as needed. The patient may have coughing blood, likely hemoptysis, which is suspected to be from the right upper lobe (RUL) and possibly due to bronchiectasis or mycobacterial disease. A repeat bronchoscopy for microbiological evaluation, including acid-fast bacilli (AFB), is planned.

The patient has anemia, which is likely due to hemoptysis, ecchymosis, and anticoagulation. The plan is to transfuse to a hemoglobin concentration of greater than 27%. The patient may have oliguria, which requires assessment for proper catheter function.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be multifactorial,
   including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneuonia,
   hemoptysis, CHF on background of asbestos-related lung disease.
   Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to endobronchial blood
   clot that may have obstructed central airway --> resp. distress.  Plan
   maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Treat infection.  Work
   towards SBT.
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- may be hypovolemia, but more concerning for sepsis
   (persistent, no obvious blood loss, and background of HTN -- now
   holding anti-HTN meds).  Doubt MI, adrenal insufficiency.  Plan
   continue to support to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Consider vasopressors as
   needed.
   HEMOPTYSIS -- Suspect RUL (post) source, suspect bronchiecatasis.
   Consider mycobacterial disease.  Limited blood through endotracheal
   tube.  Monitor clinically.
   PNEUMONIA
 Perhaps pneumonia or bronchietasis.  Ceftriaxone, Vanco,
   Azithro.
   BRADYCARDIA -- likely intrinsic lung disease, possible vagal
   stimulation or pharmachological effects.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   OLIGURIA
 assess for proper catheter function.
   HYPONATREMIA -- unclear duration.  Resolved with NS.  Monitor Na.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   be due to lung disease or pneumonia.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin.  Monitor PT.
   CAD -- no evidence for acute MI.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia.  Replete with NS.
   A-FIB -- monitor HR.  Anticoagulation, monitor INR.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- iniitate TF

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, unclear etiology. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note. 

1. Pneumonia: The patient may have evolving pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, which is a common complication in critically ill patients. The presence of fever, increased white blood cell count, and abnormal chest X-ray findings can indicate pneumonia.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's respiratory failure and hypotension, there is a risk of developing ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe inflammation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress.

3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest possible sepsis. Prompt recognition and treatment of sepsis are crucial to improve the patient's outcome.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Critically ill patients have an increased risk of developing blood clots. The patient's immobilization, decreased mobility, and central venous catheters may contribute to the development of DVT, which could potentially lead to a PE.

5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP. Close monitoring for new or worsening respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.

6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMOPTYSIS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until today when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve. Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continues to be therapeutic
   with recent INR of 2.2
   -FFP
   -vitamin K
   -trend crit q 6
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status
   -will contact IP refractory bleed
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and bronchospasm, with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC mode,
   switched to pressure support this morning.  RSBI today in the 30s.  We
   had planned for extubation but given his new bleed we will hold off for
   now until stabilized.  He has no leukocytosis or report of fevers to
   support PNA and lactate 1.5 range - but this is also in the
   differential as RLL on CT chest with concerning consolidation vs.
   aspiration related changes.
   - continue mechanical ventilation
   - ABG q am and 1 hour vent change
   - Continue propofol sedation
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, Day 5 ot 8-day course total
   - Decrease Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (from 60mg), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - PPD negative and BAL negative AFB x1, repeat sputum AFB
   - f/u other BAL and cx
   #Anemia: Improved despite recent endobronchial bleed.  Initial concern
   for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch
   on [**8-5**] and bleed this AM.
   - q6 crit for nowT&S active
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <30
   - guiac all stools
   - INR therapeutic at 2.2, continue holding Coumadin/ASA
   # hypotension/blood pressure lability: hypotension improves with
   decreased sedation and removal of fentanyl, however becomes
   hypertensive off sedation.  Art line flushed and checked against manual
   reads to ensure accuracy of aline readings.  Likely multifactorial due
   to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia and sensitivity to
   seditives.  Holding home antihypotensives.   Will attempt to wean from
   propofol gtt as we approach extubation, treat hypertension with
   labetalol ggt if needed post-sedatoin
   - continue sedation with propofol for now
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   -pacer pads in place
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable.  Prior
   decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however due to normal
   creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - continue tele monitoring
   #HTN
 d/ced lisinopril 5mg, lasix 20mg
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG.
   - monitor INR daily.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis or gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He has experienced an endobronchial bleed, but it was not directly visualized during bronchoscopy. There is a possibility of a new malignancy, as the patient has recently lost weight. The patient is also anticoagulated, with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.2.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hemoptysis: The patient has had episodes of bleeding, including an endobronchial bleed from the right upper lobe posterior segment. The etiology of the bleed is unclear but is likely multifactorial, considering the patient's multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis, and poor respiratory reserve. There is also a possibility of a new malignancy.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressure readings. Hypotension improves with decreased sedation and removal of fentanyl but becomes hypertensive off sedation. It is likely due to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia, and sensitivity to sedatives.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease who presented with a hypoxic episode likely due to aspiration and bronchospasm. He was successfully intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has evidence of right upper lobe posterior segment bleed and consolidation on chest CT, which could be indicative of pneumonia or aspiration-related changes. The patient's anemia is stable, but there was a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding that has decreased since the removal of the clot from the endotracheal tube. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and his heart rate is bradycardic, possibly due to hypovolemia and cardiac dysfunction. The patient's urine output is decreased, but his creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are normal. He has a history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and arrhythmia, and he was on warfarin and sotalol for atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 156/63 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is at 4 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1911 mL with an output of 945 mL. 

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 225, which suggests adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's blood glucose level is 147 mg/dL, and other lab values including WBC count, hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and electrolyte levels are within normal ranges. 

The patient has a history of hemoptysis, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The medical team is monitoring the patient closely for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  COPD exacerbation, hemoptysis, CHF on
   background of asbestos-related lung disease (ILD and pleural disease)
   and emphysema.  Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to
   endobronchial blood clot that may have obstructed central airway -->
   resp. distress.  Plan maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.
   Treat infection.  Work towards SBT.
   Coagulopathy
 continue to hold
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- may be hypovolemia, but more concerning for sepsis
   (persistent, no obvious blood loss, and background of HTN -- now
   holding anti-HTN meds).  Doubt MI, adrenal insufficiency.  Plan
   continue to support to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Consider vasopressors as
   needed.
   HEMOPTYSIS -- Suspect RUL (post) source, suspect bronchiecatasis.
   Consider mycobacterial disease.  Limited blood through endotracheal
   tube.  Monitor clinically.
   PNEUMONIA
 Perhaps pneumonia or bronchietasis.  Ceftriaxone, Vanco,
   Azithro.
   BRADYCARDIA -- likely intrinsic lung disease, possible vagal
   stimulation or pharmachological effects.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   OLIGURIA
 assess for proper catheter function.
   HYPONATREMIA -- unclear duration.  Resolved with NS.  Monitor Na.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   be due to lung disease or pneumonia.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin.  Monitor PT.
   CAD -- no evidence for acute MI.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of emphysema, pleural plaques, and asbestosis. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation, hemoptysis, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Key findings from the note include:
- The patient has a history of COPD, which is likely contributing to his current respiratory distress.
- He has been experiencing hemoptysis, with blood through the endotracheal tube.
- There is suspicion of a right upper lobe (RUL) blood clot causing airway obstruction.
- The patient has hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia or sepsis.
- His blood pressure is labile, fluctuating between 106/47 mmHg and 195/160 mmHg.
- The patient has anemia, possibly multifactorial in origin including hemoptysis and anticoagulation.
- He is oliguric, with a low urine output, which needs to be assessed for proper catheter function.
- The patient has hyponatremia, which resolved with normal saline (NS) administration.
- Coagulopathy is present, likely due to Coumadin use.
- There is no evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (CAD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of emphysema, pleural plaques, and asbestosis who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and hemoptysis. The patient remains intubated and sedated, with fresh blood observed in the endotracheal tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have experienced labile blood pressure and an increase in blood through the ETT this morning. The patient's laboratory results show anemia and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging shows stable chronic changes in the chest X-ray, including right upper lobe opacity. The patient's condition is complicated by potential medical complications such as respiratory failure, coagulopathy, hypotension, hemoptysis, pneumonia, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and possible coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD exacerbation and hemoptysis have led to respiratory failure. Maintaining mechanical ventilation and monitoring ABG are part of the plan to treat infection and COPD.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and prolonged PTT indicate coagulopathy. Coumadin is being held, and vitamin K reversal is planned.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, suggesting hypotension. This appears to be related to sedation.

4. Hemoptysis: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be multifactorial,
   including COPD exacerbation, evolving pneumonia/bronchopneuonia,
   hemoptysis, CHF on background of asbestos-related lung disease.
   Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to endobronchial blood
   clot that may have obstructed central airway --> resp. distress.  Plan
   maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Treat infection.  Work
   towards SBT.
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- may be hypovolemia, but more concerning for sepsis
   (persistent, no obvious blood loss, and background of HTN -- now
   holding anti-HTN meds).  Doubt MI, adrenal insufficiency.  Plan
   continue to support to maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Consider vasopressors as
   needed.
   HEMOPTYSIS -- Suspect RUL (post) source, suspect bronchiecatasis.
   Consider mycobacterial disease.  Limited blood through endotracheal
   tube.  Monitor clinically.
   PNEUMONIA
 Perhaps pneumonia or bronchietasis.  Ceftriaxone, Vanco,
   Azithro.
   BRADYCARDIA -- likely intrinsic lung disease, possible vagal
   stimulation or pharmachological effects.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   OLIGURIA
 assess for proper catheter function.
   HYPONATREMIA -- unclear duration.  Resolved with NS.  Monitor Na.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   be due to lung disease or pneumonia.
   COAGULOPATHY --  attributed to coumadin.  Monitor PT.
   CAD -- no evidence for acute MI.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and hemoptysis. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has been on propofol infusion. His vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's weight has increased slightly since admission. Fluid balance shows an input of 1911 mL and output of 945 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a positive balance of 966 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or odor, will be important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and monitoring for symptoms like calf pain or swelling are essential.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and critical illness can lead to stress ulcers. Monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  COPD exacerbation, hemoptysis, CHF on
   background of asbestos-related lung disease (ILD and pleural disease)
   and emphysema.  Suspect decompensation in OSH may be related to
   endobronchial blood clot that may have obstructed central airway -->
   resp. distress.  Plan maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.
   Treat infection and COPD.
   Coagulopathy
 continue to hold coumadin, reverse with vitamin K
   COPD -- underlying COPD; optimize medical regimen, including steroids -
   wean.
   HYPOTENSION
 appears related to sedation
   HEMOPTYSIS -- Suspect RUL (post) source
 unclear cause, reverse
   anti-coag as above
   PNEUMONIA
 doubt, complete 7 days of abx
   ANEMIA -- multifactorial, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis (right LE
   trauma), exacerbated by anticoagulation (supratherapeutic).  Evidence
   for clinical stability by Hct.  Transfuse to Hct > 27.
   a-fib
 in NSR, follow

   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until today when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve. Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP. Nurse reports
   some blood tinged return from suction this morning, approx 5cc.

   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and bronchospasm, with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC and
   PS modes when less sedated. Extubation yesterday was postponed due to
   possible new bleeding, RISB in the 30
s this morning. Concern over BP
   control when sedation weaned, will need to monitor closely.
   - SBT today to evaluate for extubation, continue mechanical ventilation
   if fails
   - Continue propofol sedation as needed
 monitor blood pressure, see
   below
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, Day 6 ot 8-day course total

   for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch
   on [**8-5**] and bleed [**8-9**].  Pt today with old blood suctioned from ETT

   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28
   - INR 1.4 this morning, will not anticoagulate in the hospital
   # Blood Pressure Lability: hypotension improves with decreased sedation
   and removal of fentanyl, however becomes hypertensive off sedation.  Pt
   with h/o HTN as outpatient but meds have been held while in hospital
   due to bradycardia/hypotension.  Art line flushed and checked against
   manual reads to ensure accuracy of aline readings.  Likely
   multifactorial due to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia
   and sensitivity to seditives.  Holding home antihypotensives.   Will
   attempt to wean from propofol gtt as we approach extubation, treat
   hypertension IV labetolol if needed post-sedation.
   - wean propofol for expectant extubation
   - labetolol IV prn for hypertension, consider gtt if needed
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   -pacer pads in place
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable.  Prior
   decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however due to normal
   creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presented with a hypoxic episode, likely due to aspiration or hemoptysis. The patient has been intubated and is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing intermittent bleeding from the endotracheal tube (ETT), which is likely due to a combination of factors such as COPD, asbestosis, poor respiratory reserve, possible new malignancy, and anticoagulation therapy. 

The patient's current conditions include constipation, atrial fibrillation, COPD exacerbation, coagulopathy, hemoptysis, and hypotension. He is being treated with propofol sedation, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, steroids, and bronchodilators. The plan is to evaluate the patient for extubation today, but if he fails, he will continue on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD exacerbation, further bleeding from the ETT, hypotension, bradycardia, decreased urine output, and potential arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event, and was found to have an endobronchial bleed. The source of the bleed is unclear but could be due to COPD, asbestos exposure, poor respiratory reserve, or a possible new malignancy. The patient has been anticoagulated in the past and continues to have a therapeutic INR despite discontinuation of warfarin. Other issues include COPD exacerbation, potential pneumonia or aspiration-related changes in the right lower lobe, anemia, hypotension/blood pressure lability, bradycardia, decreased urine output, and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and the plan is to continue this support while evaluating for extubation. Medications include propofol for sedation, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and other respiratory support measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding from the endobronchial source, potentially requiring further intervention such as embolization or surgery.
2. Respiratory failure due to worsening COPD exacerbation or pneumonia.
3. Hypotension and blood pressure instability, which could be related to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, or sensitivity to sedatives.

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until today when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve. Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP. Nurse reports
   some blood tinged return from suction this morning, approx 5cc.
   -trend crit qday
   -trend [**Last Name (LF) 173**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not plan to anticoagulate prior to discharge
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and bronchospasm, with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC and
   PS modes when less sedated. Extubation yesterday was postponed due to
   possible new bleeding, RISB in the 30
s this morning. Concern over BP
   control when sedation weaned, will need to monitor closely.
   - SBT today to evaluate for extubation, continue mechanical ventilation
   if fails
   - Continue propofol sedation as needed
 monitor blood pressure, see
   below
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, Day 6 ot 8-day course total
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - f/u on 3^rd mini-BAL--PPD negative and BAL negative AFB x2
   #Anemia: Improved despite recent endobronchial bleed.  Initial concern
   for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch
   on [**8-5**] and bleed [**8-9**].  Pt today with old blood suctioned from ETT
   tube, approx 5cc. Concern for new bleed very low based on clinical
   status, hematorcrit and vitals.
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28
   - INR 1.4 this morning, will not anticoagulate in the hospital
   # Blood Pressure Lability: hypotension improves with decreased sedation
   and removal of fentanyl, however becomes hypertensive off sedation.  Pt
   with h/o HTN as outpatient but meds have been held while in hospital
   due to bradycardia/hypotension.  Art line flushed and checked against
   manual reads to ensure accuracy of aline readings.  Likely
   multifactorial due to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia
   and sensitivity to seditives.  Holding home antihypotensives.   Will
   attempt to wean from propofol gtt as we approach extubation, treat
   hypertension IV labetolol if needed post-sedation.
   - wean propofol for expectant extubation
   - labetolol IV prn for hypertension, consider gtt if needed
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   -pacer pads in place
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable.  Prior
   decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however due to normal
   creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis versus gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has multiple complications and potential medical complications that can arise. Some of these include:

1. Endobronchial bleed: The patient has a history of bleeding, and there is a slow bleed noted from the right upper lobe posterior segment. The etiology of the bleed is unclear but is likely multifactorial due to the patient's multiple lung pathologies, including COPD, asbestosis, and poor respiratory reserve. The patient has also been anticoagulated in the past, which could contribute to the bleeding.

2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but it has improved despite recent endobronchial bleeding. There is concern for a new bleed, but it is very low based on clinical status, hematocrit, and vitals.

3. Blood pressure lability: The patient experiences hypotension that improves with decreased sedation and removal of fentanyl but becomes hypertensive off sedation. The patient has a history of hypertension, and medications have been held while in the hospital due to bradycardia/hypotension. The cause is likely multifactorial, including hypovolemia, cardiac"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, asbestos-related lung disease, emphysema, and right lower extremity trauma. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation, hemoptysis, and suspected decompensation of CHF. The patient has been intubated, sedated, and mechanically ventilated. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 155/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 40%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg and fluid balance with a total input of 2,036 mL and total output of 2,852 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 816 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, asbestos-related lung disease (ILD and pleural disease), emphysema, and previous right lower extremity trauma. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a suspected COPD exacerbation and hemoptysis. He also has hypotension, hemoptysis, and pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 155/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40%. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and asbestos-related lung disease, which can lead to respiratory failure. His current respiratory distress and the presence of a blood clot in the central airway may worsen his respiratory status.
2. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including elevated white blood cell count and positive blood cultures. This could be due to pneumonia or another source of infection.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates a bleeding tendency, possibly exacerbated by anticoagulation therapy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and asbestos-related lung disease who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and possible CHF. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The plan is to maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, treat infection and COPD, and facilitate extubation once the patient passes a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient also has coagulopathy related to excessive anticoagulation, hemoptysis, anemia, pneumonia, and a-fib.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation time, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and high INR increase the risk of bleeding, especially since anticoagulation has been held.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's current presentation suggests possible pneumonia, which can complicate the underlying respiratory failure.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is somewhat elevated, and there is a concern for possible cardiovascular complications like a-fib or acute myocardial infarction.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia, which may be due to hemoptysis, ecchymosis, or anticoagulation.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Imm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation, hemoptysis, and congestive heart failure. The patient also has a history of asbestos-related lung disease, emphysema, and possible endobronchial blood clot. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and being treated for infection and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a COPD exacerbation and hemoptysis. There is a possibility of further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy. This can be exacerbated by the hemoptysis and ecchymosis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension appears to be related to sedation. It is important to monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent further complications.
4. Hemoptysis: The patient continues to experience hemoptysis, which needs to be investigated and managed to prevent worsening respiratory symptoms.
5. Pneumonia: There is a doubt regarding pneumonia, and completing the full course of antibiotics is necessary to prevent or treat any potential infections.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is multifactorial and includes hemoptysis and ecchymosis. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion if needed is essential.

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until today when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve. Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP. Nurse reports
   some blood tinged return from suction this morning, approx 5cc.
   -trend crit qday
   -trend [**Last Name (LF) 173**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not plan to anticoagulate prior to discharge
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and bronchospasm, with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC and
   PS modes when less sedated. Extubation yesterday was postponed due to
   possible new bleeding, RISB in the 30
s this morning. Concern over BP
   control when sedation weaned, will need to monitor closely.
   - SBT today to evaluate for extubation, continue mechanical ventilation
   if fails
   - Continue propofol sedation as needed
 monitor blood pressure, see
   below
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, Day 6 ot 8-day course total
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - f/u on 3^rd mini-BAL--PPD negative and BAL negative AFB x2
   #Anemia: Improved despite recent endobronchial bleed.  Initial concern
   for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch
   on [**8-5**] and bleed [**8-9**].  Pt today with old blood suctioned from ETT
   tube, approx 5cc. Concern for new bleed very low based on clinical
   status, hematorcrit and vitals.
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28
   - INR 1.4 this morning, will not anticoagulate in the hospital
   # Blood Pressure Lability: hypotension improves with decreased sedation
   and removal of fentanyl, however becomes hypertensive off sedation.  Pt
   with h/o HTN as outpatient but meds have been held while in hospital
   due to bradycardia/hypotension.  Art line flushed and checked against
   manual reads to ensure accuracy of aline readings.  Likely
   multifactorial due to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia
   and sensitivity to seditives.  Holding home antihypotensives.   Will
   attempt to wean from propofol gtt as we approach extubation, treat
   hypertension IV labetolol if needed post-sedation.
   - wean propofol for expectant extubation
   - labetolol IV prn for hypertension, consider gtt if needed
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   -pacer pads in place
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable.  Prior
   decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however due to normal
   creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - continue tele monitoring
   #HTN
  lisinopril 5mg, will add medication as clinically necessary
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG.
   - monitor INR daily
 continue to hold coumadin [**3-11**] risk for bleed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient presented with a new hypoxic episode and was found to have hemoptysis versus gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been on anticoagulation therapy in the past and continued to be therapeutic until his INR was reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). There are concerns about the etiology of the bleed, which may be multifactorial due to COPD, asbestos exposure, poor respiratory reserve, and possible new malignancy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today to evaluate for extubation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemoptysis: The patient has ongoing blood-tinged return from suction, indicating ongoing bleeding. This could lead to further respiratory distress and hypoxia.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of anticoagulation and continued therapeutic INR levels suggest a risk for bleeding. This may contribute to the ongoing hemoptysis and potential for further bleeding complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable and may require careful monitoring and management. This can be attributed to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, and sensitivity to sedatives.

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and bronchospasm, with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC and
   PS modes when less sedated. Pt was successfully extubated on [**8-10**].
   - continue O2 by NC

   date [**8-5**])

   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - AFBs x3 negative, respiratory isolation dc
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until [**8-9**] when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve. Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP.  No evidence
   of new bleed o/n.

   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #Anemia: Stable/trending upward.  Initial concern for GI bleed now
   decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**] and
   bleed [**8-9**].  Concern for new bleed very low based on clinical status,
   hematorcrit and vitals.
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28
   - INR 1.4 this morning, will not anticoagulate in the hospital
   # Blood Pressure Lability: hypotension improves with decreased sedation
   and removal of fentanyl, however becomes hypertensive off sedation.  Pt
   with h/o HTN as outpatient but meds have been held while in hospital
   due to bradycardia/hypotension.  Art line flushed and checked against
   manual reads to ensure accuracy of aline readings.  Likely
   multifactorial due to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia
   and sensitivity to seditives.  Holding home antihypotensives.   Pt
   weaned from propofol, now tx htn with labetalol POand gtt.
   - labetolol and captopril PO for hypertension, will attempt to wean
   from drip and swich to orals today
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable.  Prior
   decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however due to normal
   creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable

   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - continue tele monitoring

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted with hypoxia and endobronchial bleed. The patient has been extubated successfully and is currently on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. He has shown improvement in his respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The patient has a history of bleeding, and there is ongoing concern for gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding.
2. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement since admission, which may be due to decreased mobility and inadequate bowel regimen.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he requires treatment for hypertension. This may be related to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, or sensitivity to sedatives.
4. Bradycardia: The patient was bradycardic while on fentanyl, but this is not currently an active issue.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, which could be due to ongoing bleeding or inadequate transfusion support.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and he requires ongoing treatment for his COPD exacerbation.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a"

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until today when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve. Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP. Nurse reports
   some blood tinged return from suction this morning, approx 5cc.
   -trend crit qday
   -trend [**Last Name (LF) 173**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not plan to anticoagulate prior to discharge
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and bronchospasm, with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC and
   PS modes when less sedated. Extubation yesterday was postponed due to
   possible new bleeding, RISB in the 30
s this morning. Concern over BP
   control when sedation weaned, will need to monitor closely.
   - SBT today to evaluate for extubation, continue mechanical ventilation
   if fails
   - Continue propofol sedation as needed
 monitor blood pressure, see
   below
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, Day 6 ot 8-day course total
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - f/u on 3^rd mini-BAL--PPD negative and BAL negative AFB x2
   #Anemia: Improved despite recent endobronchial bleed.  Initial concern
   for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch
   on [**8-5**] and bleed [**8-9**].  Pt today with old blood suctioned from ETT
   tube, approx 5cc. Concern for new bleed very low based on clinical
   status, hematorcrit and vitals.
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28
   - INR 1.4 this morning, will not anticoagulate in the hospital
   # Blood Pressure Lability: hypotension improves with decreased sedation
   and removal of fentanyl, however becomes hypertensive off sedation.  Pt
   with h/o HTN as outpatient but meds have been held while in hospital
   due to bradycardia/hypotension.  Art line flushed and checked against
   manual reads to ensure accuracy of aline readings.  Likely
   multifactorial due to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia
   and sensitivity to seditives.  Holding home antihypotensives.   Will
   attempt to wean from propofol gtt as we approach extubation, treat
   hypertension IV labetolol if needed post-sedation.
   - wean propofol for expectant extubation
   - labetolol IV prn for hypertension, consider gtt if needed
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   -pacer pads in place
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable.  Prior
   decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however due to normal
   creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - continue tele monitoring
   #HTN
  lisinopril 5mg, will add medication as clinically necessary
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG.
   - monitor INR daily
 continue to hold coumadin [**3-11**] risk for bleed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prior myocardial infarction (MI). The patient presented with a new hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis versus gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient has had multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis, and poor respiratory reserve. There is also a possibility of a new malignancy, although no clear masses are seen on the CT scan. Additionally, the patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and despite discontinuation of warfarin, he continued to be therapeutic until the INR was reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient had an endobronchial bleed that was not directly visualized but showed slow bleeding from the right upper lobe posterior segment. The cause of the bleed is unclear but is likely multifactorial due to COPD, asbestosis, poor respiratory reserve, and possible new malignancy.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient presumably desaturated secondary to an acute COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration, and bronchospasm. He was successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on assist-control (AC) and pressure support (PS) modes when"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient was initially intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but was successfully extubated without incident. He has been receiving invasive ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode and supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate ranging from 66-78 bpm, blood pressure between 121/44-132/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 317 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, normal glucose level of 99 mg/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 1.8 mg/dL. Other lab values such as creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, potassium, and liver enzymes are within normal ranges.

   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until today when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve. Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP. Nurse reports
   some blood tinged return from suction this morning, approx 5cc.

   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, aspiration and bronchospasm, with
   desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He was
   successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC and
   PS modes when less sedated. Extubation yesterday was postponed due to
   possible new bleeding, RISB in the 30
s this morning. Concern over BP
   control when sedation weaned, will need to monitor closely.
   - SBT today to evaluate for extubation, continue mechanical ventilation
   if fails
   - Continue propofol sedation as needed
 monitor blood pressure, see
   below
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, Day 6 ot 8-day course total
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - f/u on 3^rd mini-BAL--PPD negative and BAL negative AFB x2
   #Anemia: Improved despite recent endobronchial bleed.  Initial concern
   for GI bleed now decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch
   on [**8-5**] and bleed [**8-9**].  Pt today with old blood suctioned from ETT
   tube, approx 5cc. Concern for new bleed very low based on clinical
   status, hematorcrit and vitals.
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28
   - INR 1.4 this morning, will not anticoagulate in the hospital
   # Blood Pressure Lability: hypotension improves with decreased sedation
   and removal of fentanyl, however becomes hypertensive off sedation.  Pt
   with h/o HTN as outpatient but meds have been held while in hospital
   due to bradycardia/hypotension.  Art line flushed and checked against
   manual reads to ensure accuracy of aline readings.  Likely
   multifactorial due to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction with bradycardia
   and sensitivity to seditives.  Holding home antihypotensives.   Will
   attempt to wean from propofol gtt as we approach extubation, treat
   hypertension IV labetolol if needed post-sedation.
   - wean propofol for expectant extubation
   - labetolol IV prn for hypertension, consider gtt if needed
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   -pacer pads in place
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable.  Prior
   decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however due to normal
   creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above

   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prior myocardial infarction (MI). He presents with hypoxia, endobronchial bleed, and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a long-standing history of COPD, which is likely contributing to his current respiratory issues. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and has been anticoagulated in the past, although he is currently not on any anticoagulant therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 132/44 mmHg, heart rate of 68 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. His temperature is slightly elevated at 36.6°C (97.9°F). 

His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 317 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 119,000/mm³. His blood glucose level is elevated at 147 mg/dL, while his creatinine level is within normal range at 0.8 mg/dL. His electrolytes show a slight imbalance with potassium (K+) at 3.8 mEq/L and sodium (Na+) at 131 mEq/L. His arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.44, elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, and normal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 80 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. His lungs are clear bilaterally, and his heart rhythm is regular with no murmurs or abnormal sounds. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly (HSM) noted. His extremities show no edema or calf pain, and his skin is clear without rashes or lesions. His neurologic examination is normal, with intact cranial nerves, preserved sensation, and normal strength throughout.

The patient's medical history includes several complications, including hematuria, constipation, atrial fibrillation, COPD exacerbation, coagulopathy, hemoptysis, and hypotension. These conditions will need to be closely monitored and managed during the patient's stay in the ICU.

Overall, the patient is stable at this time, but his complex medical history and ongoing respiratory issues require careful monitoring and management."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of hypertension, severe COPD, and coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI).
- The patient presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis versus GI bleed.
- The patient was successfully intubated and extubated on [**8-10**].
- The patient is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula and will be weaned as tolerated.
- The patient is on a 8-day course of antibiotics (CTX, Vanco, Azithromycin) started on [**8-5**].
- The patient is also taking prednisone 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] for a total of [**11-20**] day course.
- The patient has been diagnosed with endobronchial bleed from the right upper lobe posterior segment.
- The etiology of the bleed is unclear, but it is likely multi-factorial due to multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis, and poor respiratory reserve.
- The patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and despite discontinuation of warfarin, he continued to be therapeutic until his INR was reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
- The patient's anemia is stable and trending upward.

","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, hemoptysis, and CHF on background of asbestos-related lung disease (ILD and pleural disease) and emphysema. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of hypertension, possible right upper lobe lung source of hemoptysis, pneumonia, anemia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to COPD exacerbation and hemoptysis. The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygenation and ventilation. Monitoring ABG (arterial blood gas) will be important to assess the effectiveness of the ventilation and oxygenation.

2. Infection: The patient has suspected pneumonia, and it is planned to complete 7 days of antibiotics. Infections can complicate the patient's condition and may require adjustment in the treatment plan.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy due to anticoagulation therapy. INR (international normalized ratio) has been reversed with vitamin K, and the patient is holding Coumadin. Monitoring of coagulation parameters will be important to ensure proper clotting function.

4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being controlled with labetalol. It is important to monitor"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, asbestos-related lung disease, emphysema, and possible endobronchial blood clot causing respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated but has been successfully extubated and converted to PO anti-hypertensives. The patient has shown improvement with stable vital signs and decreased need for oxygen support. However, the patient still requires respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. 

The patient has grown staph in sputum and is being treated with antibiotics. There is no evidence of acute MI, but cardiac enzymes are being monitored. The patient also has anemia, likely due to hemoptysis and ecchymosis, as well as hematuria. 

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, low platelet count, and elevated INR. The patient's coagulopathy has been reversed with vitamin K. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and potential complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation or CHF decompensation, infection from the grown staph in sputum, and bleeding complications due to the patient's coagulopathy and hematuria."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 80-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation, hemoptysis, and congestive heart failure (CHF) on background of asbestos-related lung disease (ILD) and emphysema. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and converted to PO anti-hypertensives. Staphylococcus aureus is growing in the sputum. The patient has allergies to penicillins, horse/equine product derivatives, ragweed, and tetanus. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/40 mmHg to 126/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, total fluid intake of 1,500 mL, and total fluid output of 3,241 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 4% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.44, partial pressure"

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI)who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, endobronchial bleed and bronchospasm,
   with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He
   was successfully intubated and is now comfortable with sedation on AC
   and PS modes when less sedated. Pt was successfully extubated on [**8-10**].
   - continue O2 by NC, wean as tolerated
   - continue CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin, Day 7 of 8-day course total (start
   date [**8-5**])
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   - AFBs x3 negative, respiratory isolation dc
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until [**8-9**] when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve. Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP.  No evidence
   of new bleed o/n.
   -trend crit qday
   -trend [**Last Name (LF) 173**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not plan to anticoagulate prior to discharge
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #Anemia: Stable/trending upward.  Initial concern for GI bleed now
   decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**] and
   bleed [**8-9**].  Concern for new bleed very low based on clinical status,
   hematorcrit and vitals.
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28
   - INR 1.4 this morning, will not anticoagulate in the hospital
   # Blood Pressure Lability: Pt was becoming hypotensive with sedation,
   however no longer requiring sedation.  Pt with h/o HTN as outpatient
   but meds have been held while in hospital due to
   bradycardia/hypotension, plan to restart today as pt is off sedation
   and hypertensive.  He also required labetalol gtt, however we are
   currently holding given his stabilization on home meds and off of
   sedation.
   - labetolol and captopril PO for hypertension, will adjust as needed to
   control htn
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable.  Prior
   decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however due to normal
   creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding
   - continue tele monitoring
   #HTN
  labetalol PO and gtt, PO captopril, will attempt to switch to
   PO only today..
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG (with some PVCs
   - monitor INR daily
 continue to hold coumadin [**3-11**] risk for bleed.

   #Bowel regimen: pt without recent BM.  Abdomen somewhat distended.
   Continue bowel regimen.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He presents with new hypoxic episodes and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis versus gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient was successfully intubated and extubated on [**8-10**]. He continues to require supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula, weaning as tolerated. His current medications include CTX (ceftriaxone), vancomycin, azithromycin, prednisone, albuterol/atrovent metered dose inhalers (MDIs) every 6 hours, and aspirin is currently held due to concern for endobronchial bleed.

The patient has multiple medical complications including COPD exacerbation, endobronchial bleed, anemia, blood pressure lability, bradycardia, decreased urine output, and a history of MI. He also has a history of hypertension and arrhythmia, for which he was on warfarin and sololol.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/54-207/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. His"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with respiratory failure. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/54 mmHg to 207/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with aerosol-cool. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been given nitro and PO labetalol due to an episode of chest pain. Aspirin has been held due to concern for endobronchial bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute exacerbation of COPD has led to respiratory failure, requiring ICU care. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated troponin levels and prolonged PT/INR suggest potential coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the use of anticoagulants like heparin or aspirin.

3. Hematuria: The presence of hematuria raises concerns for potential renal involvement, such as acute kidney injury or urinary tract infection. Monitoring kidney"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Hematuria
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 .H/O HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 COAGULOPATHY
 HEMOPTYSIS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI) who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, endobronchial bleed and bronchospasm,
   with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He
   was successfully intubated and then extubated on [**8-10**] without incident.
     Ruled out for TB and respiratory precautions dc
   - continue O2 by NC.
   - finish CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin today, Day 8 of 8-day course total
   (start date [**8-5**])
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until [**8-9**] when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve.   Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP.  No evidence
   of new bleed o/n.
   -trend crit qday
   -trend coags
   -will need to re-address anticoagulation on discharge in this gentleman
   with afib and high risk for stroke
   -recommend outpatient f/u of possible underlying lung mass as pt is
   high risk for lung cancer
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #Anemia: Stable/trending upward.  Initial concern for GI bleed now
   decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**] and
   bleed [**8-9**].  Concern for new GI or endobronchial bleed very low based on
   clinical status, hematocrit and vitals.  Pt also has new hematuria
   which could be contributing to his anemia, however at this time it
   appears to be improving.  We have not identified a cause for his
   hematuria at this time but foley trauma is a possibility given his
   current state of anticoagulation.  Would also be concerned for
   malignancy or ulcer.  No evidence of UTI at this time.
   - f/u hematuria w/u as outpatient
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28 and active
   bleed
   - INR normalized, continue to hold anticoagulation for now
   # Blood Pressure Lability: Pt was becoming hypotensive with sedation,
   however no longer requiring sedation.  Pt with h/o HTN as outpatient
   but meds have been held while in hospital due to
   bradycardia/hypotension, restarted as pt is off sedation and
   hypertensive.  He also required labetalol gtt, however we are currently
   holding given his stabilization on home meds and off of sedation.
   - labetolol and captopril PO for hypertension, will adjust as needed to
   control htn and attempt to control on PO only
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - dc art line today as pressures appear to have stabilized
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable, good
   UOP.  Prior decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however
   due to normal creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal
   state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding, consider restarting on DC
   - continue tele monitoring
   - htn management of outlined above
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG (with some PVCs
   - monitor INR daily
 continue to hold coumadin [**3-11**] risk for bleed.
   --continue telemetry
   #Bowel regimen: pt without recent BM.  Abdomen somewhat distended.
   Continue bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old male with a chief complaint of hemoptysis, respiratory failure, and hypertensive urgency. The patient has a history of COPD, CHF, asbestos-related lung disease, emphysema, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently receiving treatment for COPD exacerbation and has been on antibiotics for an infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) but later became MRSA-positive. The patient's hemoptysis has resolved, and he has improved from respiratory failure, now only requiring nasal cannula support. His hypertension is being managed with captopril and oral labetalol. He has anemia, which is multifactorial in origin, including hemoptysis and ecchymosis. The patient's son recently passed away, which may have contributed to his emotional distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and possible endobronchial blood clot.
2. Hemoptysis from airway and asbestos disease, with a high risk for malignancy.
3. Hypertensive urgency requiring management with labetalol.
4. Hematuria of unclear cause, possibly related to malignancy or catheter use.
5. Anemia due to hemoptysis, ecchymosis, and anticoagulation.
6. Potential need for further evaluation of hematuria, including consideration of malignancy.

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI) who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, endobronchial bleed and bronchospasm,
   with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He
   was successfully intubated and then extubated on [**8-10**] without
   incident.    Ruled out for TB and respiratory precautions dc
   - continue O2 by NC.
   - finish CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin today, Day 8 of 8-day course total
   (start date [**8-5**])
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until [**8-9**] when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve.   Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP.  No evidence
   of new bleed o/n.
   -trend crit qday
   -trend coags
   -will need to re-address anticoagulation on discharge in this gentleman
   with afib and high risk for stroke
   -recommend outpatient f/u of possible underlying lung mass as pt is
   high risk for lung cancer
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #Anemia: Stable/trending upward.  Initial concern for GI bleed now
   decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**] and
   bleed [**8-9**].  Concern for new GI or endobronchial bleed very low based on
   clinical status, hematocrit and vitals.  Pt also has new hematuria
   which could be contributing to his anemia, however at this time it
   appears to be improving.  We have not identified a cause for his
   hematuria at this time but foley trauma is a possibility given his
   current state of anticoagulation.  Would also be concerned for
   malignancy or ulcer.  No evidence of UTI at this time.
   - f/u hematuria w/u as outpatient
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28 and active
   bleed
   - INR normalized, continue to hold anticoagulation for now
   # Blood Pressure Lability: Pt was becoming hypotensive with sedation,
   however no longer requiring sedation.  Pt with h/o HTN as outpatient
   but meds have been held while in hospital due to
   bradycardia/hypotension, restarted as pt is off sedation and
   hypertensive.  He also required labetalol gtt, however we are currently
   holding given his stabilization on home meds and off of sedation.
   - labetolol and captopril PO for hypertension, will adjust as needed to
   control htn and attempt to control on PO only
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - dc art line today as pressures appear to have stabilized
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable, good
   UOP.  Prior decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however
   due to normal creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal
   state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding, consider restarting on DC
   - continue tele monitoring
   - htn management of outlined above
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG (with some PVCs
   - monitor INR daily
 continue to hold coumadin [**3-11**] risk for bleed.
   --continue telemetry
   #Bowel regimen: pt without recent BM.  Abdomen somewhat distended.
   Continue bowel regimen.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a significant medical history including hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and respiratory failure. The patient presents with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to an aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis or gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient has been treated for several conditions during his ICU stay. These include:

1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient experienced acute desaturation secondary to a COPD exacerbation, which involved coughing, endobronchial bleed, and bronchospasm. He was successfully intubated but later extubated without incident.

2. Endobronchial Bleed: The patient had a history of bleeding and underwent bronchoscopy. Although the bleed was not directly visualized, slow bleeding from the right upper lobe posterior segment was noted. The etiology of the bleed is unclear but could be multi-factorial, involving COPD, asbestosis, poor respiratory reserve, or even a new malignancy.

3. Anemia: The patient's initial concern for a gastrointestinal bleed has decreased. The anemia is stable and trending upward. Hematuria could be contributing to the anemia, possibly due to foley trauma given his current anticoagulation status. Other potential causes include malign"

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI) who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, endobronchial bleed and bronchospasm,
   with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He
   was successfully intubated and then extubated on [**8-10**] without
   incident.    Ruled out for TB and respiratory precautions dc
   - continue O2 by NC.
   - finish CTX / Vanco/Azithromycin today, Day 8 of 8-day course total
   (start date [**8-5**])
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until [**8-9**] when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve.   Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP.  No evidence
   of new bleed o/n.
   -trend crit qday
   -trend coags
   -will need to re-address anticoagulation on discharge in this gentleman
   with afib and high risk for stroke
   -recommend outpatient f/u of possible underlying lung mass as pt is
   high risk for lung cancer
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #Anemia: Stable/trending upward.  Initial concern for GI bleed now
   decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**] and
   bleed [**8-9**].  Concern for new GI or endobronchial bleed very low based on
   clinical status, hematocrit and vitals.  Pt also has new hematuria
   which could be contributing to his anemia, however at this time it
   appears to be improving.  We have not identified a cause for his
   hematuria at this time but foley trauma is a possibility given his
   current state of anticoagulation.  Would also be concerned for
   malignancy or ulcer.  No evidence of UTI at this time.
   - f/u hematuria w/u as outpatient
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28 and active
   bleed
   - INR normalized, continue to hold anticoagulation for now
   # Blood Pressure Lability: Pt was becoming hypotensive with sedation,
   however no longer requiring sedation.  Pt with h/o HTN as outpatient
   but meds have been held while in hospital due to
   bradycardia/hypotension, restarted as pt is off sedation and
   hypertensive.  He also required labetalol gtt, however we are currently
   holding given his stabilization on home meds and off of sedation.
   - labetolol and captopril PO for hypertension, will adjust as needed to
   control htn and attempt to control on PO only
   - RBC transfusion as needed
   - dc art line today as pressures appear to have stabilized
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable, good
   UOP.  Prior decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however
   due to normal creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal
   state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding, consider restarting on DC
   - continue tele monitoring
   - htn management of outlined above
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG (with some PVCs
   - monitor INR daily
 continue to hold coumadin [**3-11**] risk for bleed.
   --continue telemetry
   #Bowel regimen: pt without recent BM.  Abdomen somewhat distended.
   Continue bowel regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation.
- He presented with a hypoxic episode and likely aspiration event in the setting of hemoptysis vs. gastrointestinal bleed.
- The patient was successfully intubated and extubated on [8-10] without incident.
- He has been diagnosed with an endobronchial bleed from the right upper lobe posterior segment, which is most likely multifactorial due to multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis, and poor respiratory reserve.
- The patient has also shown signs of anemia, possibly due to gastrointestinal or endobronchial bleeding, but this is currently being managed.
- He has a history of hypertension but has been off his medication while in the hospital due to bradycardia/hypotension, and it has been restarted as he is now off sedation and hypertensive.
- The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension and low urine output, but these are currently stable.
- He has a history of myocardial infarction, but there is no evidence of recent chest pain or ischemic changes on EKG.
- The patient has been on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, but his INR has been normalized and he is currently not on any anticoagulation.

 H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, severe COPD, CAD ( s/p
   prior MI) who presents with new hypoxic episode with likely aspiration
   event in setting of hemoptysis vs. GI bleed.
   #COPD Exacerbation: Patient presumably desaturated secondary to acute
   COPD exacerbation from coughing, endobronchial bleed and bronchospasm,
   with desaturations to 70s even on high flow NRB at outside hospital. He
   was successfully intubated and then extubated on [**8-10**] without
   incident.    Ruled out for TB and respiratory precautions dc
   Antibiotics completed yesterday.
   - continue O2 by NC.
   - Continue Prednisone to 40 mg PO qday starting [**8-9**] (60mg6/29-7/3), for
   total [**11-20**] d course
   - albuterol/atrovent MDIs standing q6hrs.
   # Endobronchial bleed: Pt with history of bleed, s/p bronchoscopy.
   Bleed was not directly visualized however slow bleed noted from the RUL
   posterior segment.  Pt has not had new bleed until [**8-9**] when blood was
   noted in the ETT.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and stable from a
   respiratory perspective as well.  The etiology of the bleed is
   currently unclear but is most likely multi-factorial in this patient
   with multiple lung pathologies including COPD, asbestosis and poor
   respiratory reserve.   Also possible new malignancy (recently losing
   weight; 183--> 177 in early [**2199-6-7**] at last cardiology appointment),
   however, there are no clear masses to support this on CT.
   Additionally, this patient has been anticoagulated in the past, and
   despite discontinuation of his warfarin he continued to be therapeutic
   until we reversed his INR on [**8-9**] with vitamin K and FFP.  No evidence
   of new bleed o/n.
   -trend crit q day
   -follow coags
   -will need to re-address anticoagulation on discharge in this gentleman
   with afib and high risk for stroke
   -recommend outpatient f/u of possible underlying lung mass as pt is
   high risk for lung cancer
   -active T&S
   -IR notified of pt status / IP if refractory bleed : IR hesitant to
   intervene because embolization could risk embolization of spinal
   artery.
   -suction and turn on R side if re-bleed
   #Anemia: Stable/trending upward.  Initial concern for GI bleed now
   decreased s/p clearance of clot from ETT during bronch on [**8-5**] and
   bleed [**8-9**].  Concern for new GI or endobronchial bleed very low based on
   clinical status, hematocrit and vitals.  Pt also has new hematuria
   which could be contributing to his anemia, however at this time it
   appears to be improving.  We have not identified a cause for his
   hematuria at this time but foley trauma is a possibility given his
   current state of anticoagulation.  Would also be concerned for
   malignancy or ulcer.  No evidence of UTI at this time.
   - hematuria w/u as outpatient
   - qday hct
   - low transfusion threshold, transfuse if Hct drops <28 and active
   bleed
   - INR normalized, continue to hold anticoagulation for now, will need
   to address re-starting on DC
   -continue irrigation using three way foley
   # Blood Pressure Lability: Pt was becoming hypotensive with sedation,
   however no longer requiring sedation.  Pt with h/o HTN as outpatient
   but meds have been held while in hospital due to
   bradycardia/hypotension, restarted as pt is off sedation and
   hypertensive.  Did not require labetalol gtt o/n.
   - labetolol and captopril PO for hypertension
   -dc order for labetalol gtt
   #Bradycardia: not an active issue.  Pt was bradycardic while on
   fentanyl.
   - treat hypotension as above
   #Decreased urine output: not an active issue, creatinine stable, good
   UOP.  Prior decreased UOP likely prerenal with FENA = .04%, , however
   due to normal creatinine, FENA not as indicative of pre-renal vs. renal
   state.
   - monitor UOP
   - fluids for low UOP if pressures stable
   #COPD-Longstanding history per family. Per daughter he is usually on
   2.5L NC at home, not 1.5L per OSH records.
   -treating respiratory issues as above
   -restart Advair, albuterol nebs, Spiriva regimen
   #History of MI: No recent note of any chest pain alongside his SOB
   complaints. CKs and troponins all negative at OSH and no concerning
   ischemic EKG changes.
   - holding ASA for now given bleeding, consider restarting on DC
   - continue tele while in ICU, can dc on floor transfer
   - htn management of outlined above
   #H/O arrhythmia: Initially unclear of why patient was on Warfarin and
   Sotolol but confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ( cardiologist) that both for pAF.
   NSR now on telemetry and EKG (with some PVCs
   - monitor INR daily
 continue to hold coumadin [**3-11**] risk for bleed.
   #Bowel regimen: pt without recent BM.  Abdomen somewhat distended.
   Continue bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to an acute COPD exacerbation, endobronchial bleed, and aspiration event. The patient has been intubated and extubated without incident. His current condition is stable, and he is alert and oriented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient has a history of bleeding and experienced hemoptysis (coughing up blood) in the past. This could potentially recur and may require further investigation and management.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's severe COPD puts him at risk for recurrent exacerbations, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential respiratory failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has been anticoagulated in the past and continues to have an elevated INR despite discontinuation of warfarin. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding, endobronchial bleed, or hematuria. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause and determine appropriate management.
5. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypertension but has been hypotensive at times during his hospital stay. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure is necessary to prevent complications such"
