","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with biopsy-proven pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who underwent bilateral whole lung lavages. He is currently in the ICU due to hypoxia and unsuccessful attempts to retrieve fluid during today's left-sided lavage. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation overnight.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.3°F (fever), heart rate within normal range (71 bpm), blood pressure within normal range (128/69 mmHg), respiratory rate slightly elevated (22 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, slightly low hematocrit level of 41.7%, and platelet count within normal range at 317 K/uL. Other lab values, including creatinine, TCO2, and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include the following:
1. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: The patient had a successful right-sided whole lung lavage and an abbreviated left lavage with 1.25 liters of normal saline not retrieved from the lung. He is currently on ventilator support, and his CXR significantly improved from yesterday.
2. Mechanical ventilation: The patient remains on assist control mode with hypercarbia resolved by increasing respiratory rate. Increased PEEP overnight improved"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 25-year-old male with biopsy-proven pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who underwent bilateral whole lung lavages. He is currently in the ICU due to unsuccessful attempts to retrieve fluid during today's left-sided lavage and ongoing hypoxia. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation overnight with adjustments to ventilator settings as needed. His CXR has significantly improved from yesterday, and there are no plans for further intervention at this time.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and following appropriate weaning strategies will help mitigate this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be implemented to reduce this risk.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is on famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, which indicates a concern for stress ulcers in critically ill patients. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and maintaining an appropriate acid suppression therapy is important.
4. Fever: The patient has had a fever with moderate bacteria present in the urine analysis. Blood cultures are pending, and the source of infection could be related to instrumentation or saline infusion during the recent procedure. Monitoring the fever curve and conducting appropriate cultures is essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). He underwent right lung lavage, which was well-tolerated, but the left lung lavage had to be aborted due to hypoxemia. The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation started on 04/09/2162 at 06:04 PM, arterial line started on 04/09/2162 at 09:28 PM, and a fever of 101.3°F on 04/09/2162 at 10:00 PM.

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and experiences rashes as a result. He received various infusions of medications such as fentanyl, propofol, midazolam, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the noted events above.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis are also documented. The ABG results show pH 7.47, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 250, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, normal cardiovascular and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown value. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided information. The patient's 24-hour events include a drop in oxygen levels, leading to increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 10 to 12, followed by the detection of a cuff leak and a brief increase in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) from 40% to 100% with PEEP set at 15. This morning, the patient's FiO2 was reduced to 40% and PEEP was decreased to 10 with good arterial blood gas (ABG) results.

The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and has experienced a rash in the past. The patient has been receiving high doses of propofol and fentanyl, which are sedatives and pain relievers respectively.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 to 150/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,076 mL, including 190 mL of total intravenous fluids (IVF), 1,902 mL of IVF, and 134 mL of tube feeds (TF). The patient's output includes 843 mL of total out, consisting of 180 mL of blood products and 843 mL of urine output. The net fluid balance is 1,233 mL with a loss of 10 mL through the nasogastric (NG) tube.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and a compliance of 50 cmH2O/mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 235 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%. The patient's ventilation rate (Ve) is 10.5 L/min, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 235.

The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals that pulses in both radial and dorsalis pedis (DP) arteries are not assessed. The skin examination is also not assessed. Neurological examination findings are similarly unassessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.7 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin (H"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who underwent bilateral whole lung lavages.
- The patient experienced hypoxia and unsuccessful attempts to retrieve fluid during the left-sided lavage two days ago.
- Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation, and the CXR significantly improved from yesterday.
- The interventional pulmonologist (IP) is not planning further intervention at this time.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about obesity and dyslipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased production of secretions, and changes in oxygenation will be important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility due to mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of DVT. Monitoring for signs of DVT, such as leg swelling, redness, and warmth, is essential.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with famotidine, which suggests a concern for stress ulcers. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as black or bloody tarry stools, is important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, who underwent bilateral whole lung lavages. He is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation due to unsuccessful attempts to retrieve fluid during the left-sided lavage two days ago. The patient's oxygen saturation has improved significantly from yesterday's CXR. The physician's plan is to continue adjusting ventilator settings as needed, attempt to maintain PEEP at 10, and consider a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) later today or tomorrow morning. The patient's sedation will be managed with Propofol and may include Fentanyl/Versed for comfort given anxiety. Low-dose Lasix will be given for diuresis today due to minimal urine output. Telemetry will be continued, and the patient will receive Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis and maintain a head-of-bed (HOB) elevation greater than 30 degrees. The patient's fever is being monitored, and antibiotics are not indicated at this time. Blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient also has hyperlipidemia, which will require statin therapy upon discharge, and pharyngitis, which will be monitored post-extubation. The patient's family is aware of the code status and has provided a contact number for communication. The patient's current medications include Ensure for nutrition, heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and acetaminophen for fever management.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who underwent bilateral whole lung lavages. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation due to unsuccessful attempts to retrieve fluid during left-sided lavage two days ago. The patient's condition has shown improvement, with significant improvement in his chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 mmHg to 150/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. His temperature is within normal range at 37.6°C.

The patient's lab results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. His glucose level is elevated at 158 mg/dL. Other lab values, including lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, are within normal limits.

The patient's current plan includes continuing to adjust ventilator settings as needed, attempting to maintain PEEP at 10 cmH2O, and considering a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) later today or tomorrow morning. The patient's sedation with propofol will be evaluated, and consideration will be given to using fentanyl/versed for patient comfort due to anxiety. Low-dose Lasix will be given for diuresis today given minimal urine output."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) experiencing respiratory failure. He was desaturated during weaning of peep but then stabilized and his peep has been weaned down to 8 cmH2O. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits (49-86 bpm), blood pressure within normal limits (108/55-150/81 mmHg), respiratory rate within normal limits (14-22 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's temperature is 37.6°C, which is within normal range.

The patient has received multiple infusions of propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, and heparin sodium. Other medications include famotadine, chlorhexidine, simvastatin, and Tylenol.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory failure. Physical examination reveals crackles in the respiratory/chest area, warm skin, and muscle wasting. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, but no assessment was done for movement, tone, or other neurological functions.

His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-140/45-68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on nasal cannula with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including statin, albuterol, oral nystatin, and H2 blockers. His review of systems shows fatigue, and he is on supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's renal function is within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) including MRSA and PSA, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and glycemic control issues. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of respiratory distress, fever"
