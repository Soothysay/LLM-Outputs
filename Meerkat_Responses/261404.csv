","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy in follow-up for surgical resection. The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), chronic diarrhea, acute abdominal pain, light-headedness, and dizziness. She has been diagnosed with new-onset ascites and received packed red blood cells (PRBC) for blood transfusion. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she continues to have mild epigastric pain. The patient's medical history includes allergies to oxaliplatin and anaphylaxis, as well as previous antibiotic reactions. Her review of systems is mostly unchanged, except for gastrointestinal symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's presentation of melena, epigastric pain, nausea, and light-headedness suggests an upper gastrointestinal bleed. This could be related to her history of pancreatic cancer or complications from chemotherapy. Further investigation, such as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), is needed to identify the source of bleeding and guide appropriate management.

2. Ascites: The presence of new-onset ascites in the patient's progress note requires further evaluation. The etiology of the ascites is unclear, and it needs to be monitored closely for signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Eventually, a paracent"

   24 Hour Events:

   patient has diagnostic scoping done
   EGD-  At the initial portion of the efferent limb was blood and a 2.5
   cm linear ulcer in the setting of irregular, heaped up mucosa. This
   occupied an approximately 6 cm area. The 10 cm of efferent limb distal
   to this was normal. (biopsy)
   Otherwise normal EGD to approximately 10 cm into the afferent and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who has undergone Whipple surgery and is currently presenting with melena. The endoscopy revealed blood and a 2.5 cm linear ulcer in the efferent limb of the gastrointestinal tract, which is likely consistent with a recurrence of her pancreatic adenocarcinoma rather than a benign anastomotic ulcer. 

The patient is experiencing several medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, elevated coagulation levels, and possible malignant ascites. The gastrointestinal bleeding may be due to the ulcer found during endoscopy, while thrombocytopenia is likely related to recent chemotherapy. The elevated coagulation levels could be attributed to poor oral intake and chronic diarrhea. As for the ascites, it is unclear etiology but may be malignant in nature.

Other assessments and plans include monitoring and managing diabetes mellitus type II, holding antihypertensive medications due to gastrointestinal bleeding, and providing supportive care for a history of pulmonary embolism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate), and communication is maintained with the patient's daughter and healthcare provider. Disposition is planned for the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who underwent Whipple surgery. She presented with melena and an endoscopic examination revealed blood and a 2.5 cm linear ulcer in the initial portion of the efferent limb, along with irregular and heaped-up mucosa. The distal 10 cm of the efferent limb was normal. Biopsy was taken and pathology results are pending. The patient's current medications include morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and carafate. She has received 2 units of blood and her hematocrit (HCT) is stable. She is also on telemetry and has IV access through her PORT. The patient's coagulation profile is elevated, likely due to poor oral intake and chronic diarrhea. Her platelet count is also low, possibly related to recent chemotherapy. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, diabetes mellitus type II, and atrial fibrillation. She has a code status of DNR/DNI and her communication is being handled by her daughter and healthcare provider [**Name (NI) 566**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2854**] (work) or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2855**] (mobile).

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment following surgical resection. The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleeding, melena, light-headedness, and chronic diarrhea since her Whipple procedure. She also has acute abdominal pain and is experiencing tarry stools for one month. 

24-hour events include diagnostic endoscopy, which revealed a 2.5 cm ulcer at the prior Whipple site with no intervention or active bleeding. The patient received two additional packed red blood cells and is now hemodynamically stable. Oncology input is pending, along with pathology, radiation oncology, and surgical consults. An osh echo showed moderate-severe aortic stenosis with grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.

The patient has allergies to oxaliplatin and experiences anaphylaxis. She is currently on ICU medications such as morphine sulfate, carafate, and pantoprazole. Other medications have been reviewed per month. There are no significant changes in her medical and family history, review of systems, or flow sheet data.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance without acute distress, clear breath sounds with minimal crackles, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and warm skin. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and no sedation or paralysis.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of"

   EGD-  At the initial portion of the efferent limb was blood and a 2.5

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma who presented with melena. The patient recently underwent chemotherapy. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) revealed a 2.5 cm linear ulcer in the initial portion of the efferent limb, along with irregular and heaped up mucosa occupying approximately 6 cm area. Biopsy was performed. The patient also has unclear etiology for ascites, which may be malignant. She has elevated coags, thrombocytopenia related to recent chemotherapy, NAG acidosis related to chronic diarrhea, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, history of pulmonary embolism, and a code status of DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of melena and the findings on EGD suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to further blood loss and potential shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Malignant Ascites: The unclear etiology for ascites, which may be malignant, indicates a possibility of cancer spread or metastasis causing fluid accumulation in the abdomen. This can result in respiratory and circulatory compromise if not addressed.
3. Elevated Coagulation: The elevated coags may increase the risk of abnormal clot formation, potentially leading to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

   EGD-  At the initial portion of the efferent limb was blood and a 2.5
   cm linear ulcer in the setting of irregular, heaped up mucosa. This
   occupied an approximately 6 cm area. The 10 cm of efferent limb distal
   to this was normal. (biopsy)
   Otherwise normal EGD to approximately 10 cm into the afferent and
   efferent limbs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma who presented with melena after recent chemotherapy. She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), elevated coagulation profile, thrombocytopenia, diabetic mellitus type II, and a past history of pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB and is currently experiencing melena, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The endoscopy revealed a linear ulcer in the efferent limb, which could be due to recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma or a benign anastomotic ulcer. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to manage the bleeding.

2. Elevated coagulation profile: The patient's coagulation profile is elevated, which can increase the risk of bleeding. This may be related to poor oral intake and chronic diarrhea. Vitamin K supplementation has been given to correct the coagulopathy.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding. This is likely related to recent chemotherapy. The patient has received a platelet transfusion to address the thrombocytopenia.

4. Malignant ascites: The patient has unclear etiology for ascites, which may be malignant in nature. Diagnostic tapping will be"

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer, abdominal surgery, and diabetes mellitus. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), melena, light-headedness, and chronic diarrhea since her Whipple procedure. She also has a history of anaphylaxis to oxaliplatin.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/60 mmHg to 113/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. She has received blood transfusions totaling 450 mL and has a total output of 882 mL.

Physical examination findings include tarry stools, abdominal pain, and no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status. Laboratory results show low hemoglobin levels at 11.1 g/dL, normal leukocyte count, slightly elevated blood glucose level, low platelet count, and normal renal function. Coagulation studies indicate a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with a normal international normalized ratio (INR).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer, adenocarcinoma of the stomach (AS), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment following surgical resection. The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), melena, light-headedness, and chronic diarrhea since her Whipple procedure. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an ulcer at the anastomosis site, which is concerning for cancer recurrence.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 141/60 to 113/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to oxaliplatin.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the acute abdominal pain and new onset of ascites on imaging. The patient's allergy is noted as anaphylaxis to oxaliplatin. She is tolerating oral diet well and continues to receive intravenous pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 882 mL, with outputs of 450 mL in urine, 410 mL in blood products, and -130 mL in stool balance. The patient's laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts, although there"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of stage IIB pancreatic cancer, adnexal surgery, and diabetes mellitus. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleeding, melena, light-headedness, and chronic diarrhea since her Whipple procedure. An upper endoscopy revealed an ulcer at the anastomosis site, which is concerning for cancer recurrence.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has an ulceration around the anastomosis site, likely causing the gastrointestinal bleeding. The plan is to continue intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and sucralfate. The patient is tolerating oral diet well.
2. Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a slightly elevated INR, which is likely due to nutritional deficiencies and post-chemotherapy effects. Transfuse platelets if the count drops below 50 in the presence of active bleeding or below 10.
3. Ascites: The patient has new-onset ascites on imaging, which is concerning for a malignant effusion. Hold on tapping pending pathology results.
4. Non-anion gap acidosis: This condition has resolved, likely due to chronic diarrhea. Monitor for hydration and blood electrolyte imbalances.
5. AS murmur: The patient has an AS murmur. Perform an echocardiogram with moderate to severe AS. Monitor for congestive"
