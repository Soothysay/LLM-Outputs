   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old man with history of chondrosarcoma with relapse in gluteal
   muscle presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain found to be
   bacteremic and tachycardic.
   # Bacteremia: [**4-12**] positive bcx with GPC most likely staph or strep
   species either from skin, port, or deeper in tumor given increase in
   pain.  CT unremarkable for abscess. Given non-neutropenic status would
   hold cefepime for now.  Will continue to monitor as all lines down
   yesterday on CBC, now stabilized. Lactate has been within normal
   limits.  Has been spiking fevers over the course of the night,
   otherwise hemodynamically stable. Tachycardic as below.
   - If persistent + BCx will pursue TTE

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old man with a history of chondrosarcoma, which has relapsed in the gluteal muscle. He presents with fever, increasing buttock pain, and is found to be bacteremic and tachycardic. The patient has an indwelling port (PortaCath) and has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain control, and chemotherapy. His blood cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci, likely Staphylococcus or Streptococcus species. The patient's condition is complicated by pancytopenia, likely due to chemotherapy-induced marrow suppression. There are concerns about a possible bleed into the leg and the need for additional cycles of chemotherapy with concurrent XRT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient is bacteremic, meaning there is an infection present in his blood. This can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing an elevated heart rate, which may be due to the infection, decreased oral intake, and pain.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low levels of all blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Thigh swelling: The patient's thigh girth has increased, which could indicate fluid accumulation or a possible bleed into the leg.
5. Chondrosarcoma recurrence:"

   is most consistent with local recurrence of chondrosarcoma, possibly
   with tumoral necrosis secondary to chemo radiation treatment. Mass is
   noted to enter the pelvis along the course of the piriformis and
   obturator musculature, where it surrounds the sciatic nerve and
   inferior gluteal artery.
   Sacral plexus MRI may be helpful for evaluating perineural involvement,

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old man with history of chondrosarcoma with relapse in gluteal
   muscle presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain found to be
   bacteremic and tachycardic.
   # Bacteremia: [**4-12**] positive bcx with GPC most likely staph or strep
   species either from skin, port, or deeper in tumor given increase in
   pain.  CT unremarkable for abscess. Given non-neutropenic status would
   hold cefepime for now.  Will continue to monitor as all lines down
   yesterday on CBC, now stabilized. Lactate has been within normal
   limits.  Has been spiking fevers over the course of the night,
   otherwise hemodynamically stable. Tachycardic as below.
   - If persistent + BCx will pursue TTE
   - Culture with spikes off port and peripheral q24 hours, if no spikes
   with send surveillance cultures.
   - Vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV
   - Ortho recs, saw patient yesterday, no recs in chart
   - Onc recs
   # Tachycardia: Has been in sinus tachycardia in setting of infection
   and decreased PO intake as well as pain.  HR has increased in the
   setting of fever spikes and decreased with pain control.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue to give IVF prn if patient is taking minimal PO
   - Tylenol prn fevers
   - Pain control with outpatient regimen of oxycontin, oxycodone and
   dilaudid for breakthrough.
   # Chondrosarcoma: Per records patient due to for additional cycle of
   infusional chemotherapy with concurrent XRT today.
   - Likely will need to await resolution of current infection
   - Will continue to monitor thigh diameter as patient with increased
   pain, concern for bleed into leg
   - Will discuss timing of therapy with oncology
   # Pancytopenia: Likely from chemotherapy induced marrow suppresion.
   Normo-cytic with no RDW expansion to suggest hemolysis. No evidence of
   acute blood loss.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be a dilutional component as patient has
   rec'd around 7 L of IVF.
   - Dc'd ranitidine as it can cause marrow suppression
   - Guaiac stools x3
   - Will discuss with heme/onc

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 42-year-old man with a history of chondrosarcoma, which has relapsed in the gluteal muscle. He is currently presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain, and bacteremia. His lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and decreased platelet count. He also has an abnormal appearance of the left gluteal musculature on imaging, consistent with local recurrence of chondrosarcoma. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for bacteremia and is also receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy for his chondrosarcoma. He is also on prophylactic medications for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 126 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's condition appears to be unstable, with ongoing fever spikes, tachycardia, and potential pancytopenia. There is also concern for increased girth in the thigh area, which may indicate bleeding into the leg. The patient's code status is full code, indicating that resuscitative measures should be taken if his heart stops or if he stops breathing."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of relapsed chondrosarcoma who is currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He presents with fever, worsening gluteal pain, and an elevated lactate level, indicating a possible early septic picture. Blood cultures from April 28th to May 12th showed growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) likely Streptococcus, suggesting a bacterial infection. The source of the infection is likely the left gluteal mass, which is a local recurrence of chondrosarcoma without abscess formation. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

The patient also has pancytopenia, which is likely due to dilutional effects from chemotherapy. He is experiencing tachycardia, which may be multifactorial, including pain, fevers, and decreased oral intake. The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure but an elevated heart rate. Pain control measures are being attempted with the transition to a fentanyl patch for breakthrough pain.

The patient is due for radiation therapy today and needs to be followed up with an oncologist. He has received boots, was discharged out of bed, and is on proton pump inhibitor medication. The patient is ready for transfer back to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, further deterioration of pancytopenia, and adverse effects from chemotherapy or"

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of relapsed chondrosarcoma currently undergoing Adriamycin treatment and daily XRT. He presents with fever, worsening gluteal pain, and an early septic picture accompanied by elevated lactate levels and tachycardia. Blood cultures from 4/12 to 4/28 show growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, likely Streptococcus, originating from the left gluteal mass (tumor necrosis), without abscess formation on pelvic CT. He is being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

The patient has been experiencing continued tachycardia despite receiving approximately 7 liters of intravenous fluids since admission, with stable blood pressure. He continues to spike fevers and has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were ceftriaxone on 4/29 at 4:22 PM and vancomycin on 4/30 at 4:00 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old man with history of chondrosarcoma with relapse in gluteal
   muscle presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain found to be
   bacteremic and tachycardic.
   # Bacteremia: [**4-12**] positive bcx with Strep Pyogenes. Potential sources
   include port, abscess within leg, or hardware.  CT unremarkable for
   abscess. ID consulted yesterday, will officially consult today.  They
   recommended changing to ctx 2gm IV q24 (endocarditis dosing) and adding
   clinda if patient becomes HD unstable.  All subsequent bcx from port
   and peripheral have been no growth to date. WBC is stable.  Lactate has
   been within normal limits.  T max 101.7 yesterday am, low grade around
   100.5 during the day.  Patient did spike to 101.2 during rounds this
   morning.  Otherwise hemodynamically stable. Tachycardic as below.
   - TTE without any signs of vegetations or valvular abnormalities, will
   discuss potential for TEE with ID today and await their recs
   - Continue to CIS, if no spikes will send surveillance cultures off
   port and peripheral
   - Continue ceftriaxone IV as above
   - Ortho recs: concern over potential abscess at the site of tumor, but
   no urgent surgical intervention at this time. Recommended continuing
   with current treatment plan
   - Onc recs: holding on chemotherapy but continuing with XRT
   - ID recs today regarding pulling portacath
   # Tachycardia: Has been in sinus tachycardia in setting of infection
   and decreased PO intake as well as pain.  HR has increased in the
   setting of fever spikes and decreased with pain control.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue to give IVF prn if patient is taking minimal PO, though
   appears to have adequate intake now. Will give 1L now given persistent
   fevers and likely inadequate PO fluid intake
   - Tylenol prn fevers
   - Pain control with oxycontin, increased to 120mg q8H based on opioid
   requirements over the course of the day, oxycodone and dilaudid for
   breakthrough.  Held off on fentanyl patch for now per rad onc.
   # Chondrosarcoma: Patient is currently receiving infusional adriamycin
   and XRT weekly.  This week, patient is scheduled for third cycle.
   Getting XRT and holding on chemo as above
   - Will continue to monitor thigh diameter as patient with increased
   pain, concern for bleed into leg
   - Continue to follow with onc, ortho and radonc
   # Pancytopenia: Likely from chemotherapy induced marrow suppression.
   Normocytic with no RDW expansion to suggest hemolysis. No evidence of
   acute blood loss.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be a dilutional component as patient has
   rec'd around 7 L of IVF.
   - Dc'd ranitidine as it can cause marrow suppression
   - Guaiac stools x3
   - Continue to discuss with heme/onc

","The patient is a 42-year-old man with a history of chondrosarcoma, which has relapsed in the gluteal muscle. He is currently presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain, bacteremia, and tachycardia. The patient underwent radiation therapy and is being treated with antibiotics for a possible port infection or prosthesis infection. There are concerns about potential endocarditis, so an official ID consult has been placed. The patient's pain regimen has been changed to oxycontin 120 mg every 6 hours, along with oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Repeat surveillance blood cultures have been obtained.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.5 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius (99.8 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate in the range of 110-140 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/63 to 130/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood work shows leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, normal hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, slightly low platelet count of 112 K/uL, normal creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and slightly elevated glucose level of 6 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old man with history of chondrosarcoma with relapse in gluteal
   muscle presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain found to be
   bacteremic and tachycardic.
   # Bacteremia: [**4-12**] positive bcx with Strep Pyogenes. Potential sources
   include port, abscess within leg, or hardware.  CT unremarkable for
   abscess. ID consulted yesterday, will officially consult today.  They
   recommended changing to ctx 2gm IV q24 (endocarditis dosing) and adding
   clinda if patient becomes HD unstable.  All subsequent bcx from port
   and peripheral have been no growth to date. WBC is stable.  Lactate has
   been within normal limits.  T max 101.7 yesterday am, low grade around
   100.5 during the day.  Patient did spike to 101.2 during rounds this
   morning.  Otherwise hemodynamically stable. Tachycardic as below.
   - TTE without any signs of vegetations or valvular abnormalities, will
   discuss potential for TEE with ID today and await their recs
   - Continue to CIS, if no spikes will send surveillance cultures off
   port and peripheral
   - Continue ceftriaxone IV as above
   - Ortho recs: concern over potential abscess at the site of tumor, but
   no urgent surgical intervention at this time. Recommended continuing
   with current treatment plan
   - Onc recs: holding on chemotherapy but continuing with XRT
   - ID recs today regarding pulling portacath
   # Tachycardia: Has been in sinus tachycardia in setting of infection
   and decreased PO intake as well as pain.  HR has increased in the
   setting of fever spikes and decreased with pain control.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue to give IVF prn if patient is taking minimal PO, though
   appears to have adequate intake now. Will give 1L now given persistent
   fevers and likely inadequate PO fluid intake
   - Tylenol prn fevers
   - Pain control with oxycontin, increased to 120mg q8H based on opioid
   requirements over the course of the day, oxycodone and dilaudid for
   breakthrough.  Held off on fentanyl patch for now per rad onc.
   # Chondrosarcoma: Patient is currently receiving infusional adriamycin
   and XRT weekly.  This week, patient is scheduled for third cycle.
   Getting XRT and holding on chemo as above
   - Will continue to monitor thigh diameter as patient with increased
   pain, concern for bleed into leg
   - Continue to follow with onc, ortho and radonc
   # Pancytopenia: Likely from chemotherapy induced marrow suppression.
   Normocytic with no RDW expansion to suggest hemolysis. No evidence of
   acute blood loss.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be a dilutional component as patient has
   rec'd around 7 L of IVF.
   - Dc'd ranitidine as it can cause marrow suppression
   - Guaiac stools x3

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old man with a history of chondrosarcoma that has relapsed in the gluteal muscle. He is currently presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain, and bacteremia. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, which has been persistent throughout the day.

The patient has undergone several tests and interventions, including:
1. Radiation therapy
2. Change in pain regimen to include Oxycontin, oxycodone, and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain
3. Repeated surveillance blood cultures
4. Unable to call out to OMED due to continued tachycardia
5. Administration of antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin)
6. Consultation with Infectious Disease specialist for potential port infection vs prosthesis infection
7. Recommendation to change antibiotic to CTX 2 gm IV Q24 (endocarditis dose), and adding clinda for TSS if patient becomes HD unstable
8. ECHO done, no vegetations identified
9. CT unremarkable for abscess
10. Monitoring for potential abscess at the site of tumor
11. Holding on chemotherapy but continuing with XRT
12. ID recommendations regarding pulling portacath

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tmax: 38.1 C (100.5 F)
- Tcurrent: 37.7 C (99.8 F)
- HR: 118 bpm (110-140 bpm)
- BP: 104/63 mmHg (72-130/84-94 mmHg)
- RR: 17 breaths per minute (9-23 breaths per minute)
- SpO2: 95%

The patient's lab results show:
- WBC: 5.0 (3.9-11.0 K/uL)
- Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL (12.0-16.0 g/dL)
- Platelets: 112 K/uL (150-450 K/uL)
- Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dL)
- Glucose: 88 mg/dL (70-100 mg/dL)
- Other labs including PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/TBili, Differential, Fibrinogen, Lactic Acid, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, PO4 are within normal limits.

Imaging results show no obvious valvular vegetations on ECHO, and CT unremarkable for abscess.

The patient's medical complications that can arise include:
1. Potential sources of bacteremia include port, abscess within leg, or hardware.
2. Tachycardia may be due to infection, decreased PO intake, or pain.
3. Pancytopen"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old man with history of chondrosarcoma with relapse in gluteal
   muscle presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain found to be
   bacteremic and tachycardic.
   # Bacteremia: [**4-12**] positive bcx with Strep Pyogenes. Potential sources
   include port, abscess within leg, or hardware.  CT unremarkable for
   abscess. ID consulted yesterday, will officially consult today.  They
   recommended changing to ctx 2gm IV q24 (endocarditis dosing) and adding
   clinda if patient becomes HD unstable.  All subsequent bcx from port
   and peripheral have been no growth to date. WBC is stable.  Lactate has
   been within normal limits.  T max 101.7 yesterday am, low grade around
   100.5 during the day.  Otherwise hemodynamically stable. Tachycardic as
   below.
   - TTE without any signs of vegetations or valvular abnormalities, will
   discuss potential for TEE with ID today and await their recs
   - Continue to CIS, if no spikes will send surveillance cultures off
   port and peripheral
   - Continue ceftriaxone IV as above
   - Ortho recs: concern over potential abscess at the site of tumor, but
   no urgent surgical intervention at this time. Recommended continuing
   with current treatment plan
   - Onc recs: holding on chemotherapy but continuing with XRT
   # Tachycardia: Has been in sinus tachycardia in setting of infection
   and decreased PO intake as well as pain.  HR has increased in the
   setting of fever spikes and decreased with pain control.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue to give IVF prn if patient is taking minimal PO, though
   appears to have adequate intake now
   - Tylenol prn fevers
   - Pain control with oxycontin, increased to 120mg q8H based on opioid
   requirements over the course of the day, oxycodone and dilaudid for
   breakthrough.  Held off on fentanyl patch for now per rad onc.
   # Chondrosarcoma: Patient is currently receiving infusional adriamycin
   and XRT weekly.  This week, patient is scheduled for third cycle.
   Getting XRT and holding on chemo as above
   - Will continue to monitor thigh diameter as patient with increased
   pain, concern for bleed into leg
   - Continue to follow with onc, ortho and radonc
   # Pancytopenia: Likely from chemotherapy induced marrow suppression.
   Normocytic with no RDW expansion to suggest hemolysis. No evidence of
   acute blood loss.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be a dilutional component as patient has
   rec'd around 7 L of IVF.
   - Dc'd ranitidine as it can cause marrow suppression
   - Guaiac stools x3
   - Continue to discuss with heme/onc

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old man with a history of chondrosarcoma and current relapse in the gluteal muscle. He is presenting with fever, increasing buttock pain, and bacteremia. The patient has been diagnosed with Group A Strep bacteremia and is also experiencing tachycardia.

The patient underwent radiation therapy, and an official ID consult was placed to evaluate the possibility of a port infection versus prosthesis infection, as well as determine the appropriate length of therapy. The patient's pain regimen has been changed to include Oxycontin 120 TID, oxycodone, and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Surveillance blood cultures have been repeated.
