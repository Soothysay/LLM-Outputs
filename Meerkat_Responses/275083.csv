   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient was to be called out in the am, however she had SBPs in the
   70's to 80's.  Asymptomatic.  Was given 500 cc IVF bolus x 2 with
   slight improvment in her pressures.  Was kept in the ICU overnight for
   continued monitoring.  States her SBPs at home run in the 100s.  Her
   BP's came up to the 110's to 120's overnight.
   - Was asked about her OSA and she states she hasn't used CPAP for the
   last 2 years.
   - KUB (prelim) showed no evidence of obstruction or ileus.
   - CXR PA and Lat showed: Opacity adjacent to the right heart border
   that could represent crowding of normal vasculature, however,
   atelectasis or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   - PT stated patient was okay to walk with the knee immobilizer.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old female with recent history of C. diff colitis who presented
   after a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea/dehydration with a
   hip disclocation
   # Hypotension: Hypotension noted yesterday prior to call out ranging
   from the 80s-90s SBP, pt was given 2 x 500ccNS bolus after which her
   SBP increased to the 100s. Hypotension likely due to a hypovolemic
   state secondary to severe diarrhea. Pt now euvolemic will not give
   additional fluid.
   - Continue to monitor hydration status, urine output
   - As patient not currently toxic appearing will hold off on further
   antibiotics, can consider broadening coverage if any evidence of
   decompensation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis now improving, today noted to be 13.7 down
   from 16.9. Leukocytosis likely due to C. diff colitis infection. Given
   lack of fevers within the past 24 hours and improving WBC count C. diff
   colitis appears to be responding to antibiotic regimen.
   - Continue to treat with flagyl and will add PO vanc for C. diff
   coverage given initial WBC >20, diarrhea and hypotension
   - Follow bcx, urine - here and from OSH
   - Culture with spikes
   - Expand coverage if any other localizing signs of infection
   .
   # Diarrhea: Ongoing for greater than one week, pt currently on a fecal
   management system.  Loose watery stools are still noted but appear to
   be decreased in amount. Pt complains of some abdominal cramping
   symptoms which is secondary to her C. diff colitis. Given her improving
   leukocytosis, absence of fever and unremarkable KUB her C. diff is
   responding to treatment.
   - Treat with IV flagyl, PO vanco
   - Will continue to monitor abd cramping
   - Replete lytes prn
   .
   # Hypoxia: Transient in the setting of sedation for hip reduction.
   Initially was linked to sedation which was reversed with narcan and
   patient regained normal oxygen saturations.  Only requiring 2L nasal
   canula in the ED to maintain sats >95%.  She has a diagnosis of OSA and
   though she is ordered for CPAP at home she does not wear it. Will fit
   her for CPAP today, bibasilar atelectasis also notable on todays exam
   which may also be a component.
   - Continue supplemental oxygen, wean as tolerated
   - Fit for CPAP with respiratory therapy
   .
   # Hip dislocation: Status post reduction in the ED by ED staff and
   orthopedics.  Hip had dislocated multiple times in the past, usually
   reduced in OR.  Patient is currently in knee immbolizer, no plans for
   surgical intervention at this time. Orthopaedics recommended seeing her
   as an outpatient as she was able to ambulate on her disclocation.
   - Continue to follow ortho recs
   - Will have pt sit in chair today
   - Knee immbolizier overnight
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Pt
s Creatinine intitally noted to be 1.4 not trended down to
   1.1 following IVF hydration. [**Last Name (un) 2406**] most likely pre-renal secondary to
   diarrhea.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine
   .
   # Non-anion gap metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to diarrhea, will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # RLS: Continue requip
   .
   # Fibromyalgia: Continue neurontin, renally dose
   .
   # Anxiety/depression: Continue buproprion and prozac, clarify dose in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with recent history of C. diff colitis who presented after a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea/dehydration with a hip dislocation. She was given 2 x 500ccNS bolus which increased her SBP to the 100s. The hypotension is likely due to a hypovolemic state secondary to severe diarrhea. The patient is currently euvolemic and will not receive additional fluid. She has leukocytosis, which is improving, and ongoing diarrhea for greater than one week. Her C. diff colitis appears to be responding to antibiotic regimen. The patient also has a diagnosis of OSA and does not wear her CPAP at home. She has bibasilar atelectasis also noted on today's exam. The patient's hip dislocation was reduced in the ED by ED staff and orthopedics. She is currently in a knee immobilizer, and there are no plans for surgical intervention at this time. The patient's creatinine initially noted to be 1.4 trended down to 1.1 following IVF hydration. She likely has pre-renal azotemia secondary to diarrhea. She is expected to transfer to the floor today given her normotensive state and improving C. diff clinical status.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old female with recent history of C. diff colitis who presented
   after a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea/dehydration with a
   hip disclocation
   # Hypotension: Likely due to profound dehydration from ongoing severe
   diarrhea.  Patient has been unable to maintain hydration and has
   required upwards of 10 L of IVF since her admission to the OSH ED.
   Here, patient has only received 2L of NS over the last several hours in
   the ED; however, despite SBPs in the 90s, she has not required
   pressors.  Syncope likely result of orthostatic hypotension.
   - Continue aggressive hydration overnight
   - Continue to treat for likely C. diff
   - As patient not currently toxic appearing will hold off on further
   antibiotics, can consider broadening coverage if any evidence of
   decompensation.
   - Check orthostatics x1 in am
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Highest on the differential is C. diff colitis given
   diarrhea and history.  CXR at OSH showed resolution of prior pna.
   Patient denies cough or fevers at home, though there is report of
   hypoxia as noted above.  CXR here appears to be clear, final read is
   pending.  Differential shows left shift without bandemia, no recent WBC
   for comparison.  UA negative.
   - Continue to treat with flagyl and will add PO vanc for C. diff
   coverage given initial WBC >20, diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to trend wbc with differential
   - Follow bcx, urine - here and from OSH
   - Send stool for culture, c. diff
   - Culture with spikes
   - Follow up final read of CXR
   - Expand coverage if any other localizing signs of infection
   .
   # Diarrhea: Ongoing for greater than one week.  Now with some mild
   abdominal discomfort. WBC 17, down from >20 at OSH.  Patient with
   continued stool output, history of C. diff in [**2177**] and multiple courses
   of recent abx.  C. diff highest on differential
   - Send stool for culture, c. diff
   - Treat with IV flagyl, PO vanco
   - Will check KUB given abdominal discomfort, can get CT if persists
   - Replete lytes prn
   - IVF
   .
   # Hypoxia: Transient in the setting of sedation for hip reduction.
   Sedation reversed with narcan and patient regained normal oxygen
   saturations.  Only requiring 2L nasal canula in the ED to maintain sats
   >95%.  However, patient has had multiple episodes of destauration as
   documented in OSH records per visiting nursing.
   - Continue supplemental oxygen, wean as tolerated
   - Monitor level of sedation
   - PA/Lat CXR in am to further evaluation for pna
   - Attempt to clarify hypoxia at home
   .
   # Hip dislocation: Status post reduction in the ED by ED staff and
   orthopedics.  Hip had dislocated multiple times in the past, usually
   reduced in OR.  Patient is currently in knee immbolizer, no plans for
   surgical intervention at this time.
   - Continue to follow ortho recs
   - PT in am
   - Knee immbolizier overnight
   - Pain control prn, has not required medication yet
   .
   # ARF: No recent creatinine for comparison, likely elevated from
   baseline given dehydration, pre-renal etiology. Was elevated to 2.17 at
   OSH, appears to be improving with hydration
   - Will obtain OSH records to assess baseline renal function
   - Send urine lytes in am if not improved with hydration
   .
   # ECG changes: ST depression in lateral precordial leads on ECG here in
   ED, not on prior ECG at OSH, likely demand ischemia given
   hypotension/dehydration. Patient denies chest pain, though she did have

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a recent history of C. diff colitis who presented after a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea/dehydration with a hip dislocation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been unable to maintain hydration and has required upwards of 10 L of IVF since admission to the OSH ED. Despite SBPs in the 90s, she has not required pressors. Syncope likely resulted from orthostatic hypotension.

2. Leukocytosis: The highest on the differential is C. diff colitis given the diarrhea and history. CXR at OSH showed resolution of prior pneumonia. Patient denies cough or fevers at home, though there is report of hypoxia as noted above. CXR here appears to be clear, final read is pending.

3. Diarrhea: Ongoing for greater than one week. Now with some mild abdominal discomfort. WBC 17, down from >20 at OSH. Patient with continued stool output, history of C. diff in [**2177**] and multiple courses of recent abx. C. diff highest on differential.

4. Hypoxia: Transient in the setting of sedation for hip reduction. Sedation reversed with narcan and patient regained normal oxygen saturations. Only requiring 2L nasal canula in the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for several conditions.

The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, which has resolved after receiving intravenous fluids. The patient also experienced syncope but was not associated with any head trauma. The patient's abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants.

The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and has been noncompliant with home noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection twice before, and there is a suspicion that this may be a recurrence due to the recent antibiotic use.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 71/43 mmHg to 130/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well-controlled.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and a slightly decreased hemoglobin level. Kidney function tests show a normal creatinine level but an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. Liver function tests are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal no obstruction in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. The assessment and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old overweight/obese male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, chronic diarrhea, and recent antibiotic use. He presented to the ICU with hypotension, syncope, and diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has shown some fluctuations in blood pressure. He is currently receiving IV fluids and has responded well to resuscitation. Laboratory results indicate possible infection and kidney dysfunction. The patient's abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants, and respiratory examination shows crackles in the lungs. Imaging reveals no obstruction or dilated loops. The patient's condition is being treated with antibiotics for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, as well as IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin. Other medical conditions include hypoxemia, acute kidney injury, ECG changes, and sleep-disordered breathing. The patient's hip dislocation has been stabilized, and he is scheduled for physical therapy and occupational therapy. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff infection recurrence
2. Kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury
3. Hypotension and potential hypovolemia
4. Hypoxemia and respiratory issues
5. Sleep-disordered breathing and noncompliance with home NIPPV
6. ECG changes and possible underlying coronary artery disease

   65 year old female with recent history of C. diff colitis who presented
   after a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea/dehydration with a
   hip disclocation
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis showed an impressive increase from 13.7 to
   19.3. However clinically pt appears to be improving. She states her
   abdominal pain is improving, she has been afebrile and she has had no
   increase in bowel movements. Her pulmonary exam is also unremarkable
   save bibasilar crackles likely atelectasis. Pt has had a foley in will
   perform a U/A, urine cx and d/c foley.
   - Continue to treat with flagyl and will add PO vanc for C. diff
   coverage given initial WBC >20, diarrhea and hypotension
   - D/c foley check U/A, Urine Cx
   -Follow bcx
   - Culture with spikes
   - Expand coverage if any other localizing signs of infection
   .
   # Diarrhea: Ongoing for greater than one week, pt currently on a fecal
   management system.  Loose watery stools are still noted but appear to
   be decreased in amount. Pt abdominal cramping symptoms are still
   persistent but improved, cramps are most likely from C. diff colitis.
   Will trend WBC and monitor clinical status.
   - Treat with IV flagyl, PO vanco
   - Will continue to monitor abd cramping
   - Replete lytes prn
   .
   # Hypoxia: Transient in the setting of sedation for hip reduction.
   Initially was linked to sedation which was reversed with narcan and
   patient regained normal oxygen saturations.  Only requiring 2L nasal
   canula in the ED to maintain sats >95%.  She has a diagnosis of OSA and
   though she is ordered for CPAP at home she does not wear it. Pt was
   fitted for for CPAP yesterday and was able to tolerate it for a few
   hours last night. Pt also currently on no supplemental oxygen.
   - Continue CPAP at night
   .
   # Hip dislocation: Status post reduction in the ED by ED staff and
   orthopedics.  Hip had dislocated multiple times in the past, usually
   reduced in OR.  Patient is currently in knee immbolizer, no plans for
   surgical intervention at this time. Orthopaedics recommended seeing her
   as an outpatient as she was able to ambulate on her disclocation.
   - Continue to follow ortho recs
   - Continue Knee immbolizer.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with recent history of C. diff colitis, presenting after a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea/dehydration with a hip dislocation. She has been treated for leukocytosis, diarrhea, hypotension, and hypoxia. The patient underwent hip reduction in the ED and is currently immobilized with a knee immobilizer. She is also being treated for non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, restless leg syndrome, fibromyalgia, anxiety/depression, and has been NPO with IVF hydration. The patient's creatinine initially noted to be 1.4 has trended down to 1.1 following IVF hydration, most likely pre-renal secondary to diarrhea. The patient's conditions include ongoing diarrhea for greater than one week, loose watery stools, persistent abdominal cramping symptoms, and decreased amount of stool. The patient's vital signs include temperature of 36.9 C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 142/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a recent history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, who presented after experiencing a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea and dehydration with a hip dislocation. The patient's abdominal pain is improving, and she has been afebrile without an increase in bowel movements. Her pulmonary exam shows bibasilar crackles likely due to atelectasis. The patient has a Foley catheter in place, and urine analysis, urine culture, and discontinuation of the Foley catheter are planned. She is currently being treated with metronidazole and will have PO vancomycin added for C. diff coverage due to an elevated white blood cell count, diarrhea, and hypotension. 

The patient's diarrhea has been ongoing for over a week, and she is on a fecal management system. Loose watery stools are still present but appear to be decreased in amount. The patient still experiences abdominal cramping symptoms, which are likely related to C. diff colitis. Her WBC count will be trended, and her clinical status will be monitored. 

The patient experienced transient hypoxia during sedation for hip reduction but regained normal oxygen saturations after naloxone administration. She requires only 2L of nasal cannula to maintain sats >95%. She has a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is being fitted for CPAP at home"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old female with recent history of C. diff colitis who presented
   after a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea/dehydration with a
   hip disclocation
   # Hypotension: Hypotension noted yesterday prior to call out ranging
   from the 80s-90s SBP, pt was given 2 x 500ccNS bolus after which her
   SBP increased to the 100s. Hypotension likely due to a hypovolemic
   state secondary to severe diarrhea. Pt now euvolemic will not give
   additional fluid.
   - Continue to monitor hydration status, urine output
   - As patient not currently toxic appearing will hold off on further
   antibiotics, can consider broadening coverage if any evidence of
   decompensation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis now improving, today noted to be 13.7 down
   from 16.9. Leukocytosis likely due to C. diff colitis infection. Given
   lack of fevers within the past 24 hours and improving WBC count C. diff
   colitis appears to be responding to antibiotic regimen.
   - Continue to treat with flagyl and will add PO vanc for C. diff
   coverage given initial WBC >20, diarrhea and hypotension
   - Follow bcx, urine - here and from OSH
   - Culture with spikes
   - Expand coverage if any other localizing signs of infection
   .
   # Diarrhea: Ongoing for greater than one week, pt currently on a fecal
   management system.  Loose watery stools are still noted but appear to
   be decreased in amount. Pt complains of some abdominal cramping
   symptoms which is secondary to her C. diff colitis. Given her improving
   leukocytosis, absence of fever and unremarkable KUB her C. diff is
   responding to treatment.
   - Treat with IV flagyl, PO vanco
   - Will continue to monitor abd cramping
   - Replete lytes prn
   .
   # Hypoxia: Transient in the setting of sedation for hip reduction.
   Initially was linked to sedation which was reversed with narcan and
   patient regained normal oxygen saturations.  Only requiring 2L nasal
   canula in the ED to maintain sats >95%.  She has a diagnosis of OSA and
   though she is ordered for CPAP at home she does not wear it. Will fit
   her for CPAP today, bibasilar atelectasis also notable on todays exam
   which may also be a component.
   - Continue supplemental oxygen, wean as tolerated
   - Fit for CPAP with respiratory therapy
   .
   # Hip dislocation: Status post reduction in the ED by ED staff and
   orthopedics.  Hip had dislocated multiple times in the past, usually
   reduced in OR.  Patient is currently in knee immbolizer, no plans for
   surgical intervention at this time. Orthopaedics recommended seeing her
   as an outpatient as she was able to ambulate on her disclocation.
   - Continue to follow ortho recs
   - Will have pt sit in chair today
   - Knee immbolizier overnight
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Pt
s Creatinine intitally noted to be 1.4 not trended down to
   1.1 following IVF hydration. [**Last Name (un) 2406**] most likely pre-renal secondary to
   diarrhea.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine
   .
   # Non-anion gap metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to diarrhea, will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # RLS: Continue requip
   .
   # Fibromyalgia: Continue neurontin, renally dose
   .
   # Anxiety/depression: Continue buproprion and prozac, clarify dose in
   am
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, IVF overnight
   .
   # Access: RIJ/PIV
   .
   #. Dispo: Will likely transfer to floor today given her normotensive
   state, improving C. diff clinical status.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a recent history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, who presented after experiencing a syncopal episode in the setting of diarrhea and dehydration with a hip dislocation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for C. diff colitis, including IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 142/81 to 143/108 mmHg, heart rate between 94 and 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 95%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and has an indwelling multi-lumen line.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 13.7 to 19.3 thousand/mm3, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and low platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, are also within normal limits.

The patient's main medical concerns include hypotension, leukocytosis, diarrhea, hypoxia, hip dislocation, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, restless leg syndrome (RLS), fibromyalgia, anxiety/depression, and fecal management. The patient's current plan involves continuing treatment"

   DIARRHEA- in the setting of prior C. diff and recent ABX, recurr C.
   diff is most likely
   -toxin assay pending
   -KUB to eval for megacolon
   -will tx w/ PO vancomycin and IV metronidazole for now
   -non-gap metabolic acidosis goes along with this clinical picture
   HYPOXEMIA- transient, no evidence of infiltrate on CXR, monitor for
   edema given aggressive fluid resuscitation. Also low-suspicion but will
   check for resp viral syndromes
   -influenza neg
    ARF- due to hypovolemia and resolving with IVF resuscitation
   -cont to monitor
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   ECG changes- no hx of CAD, but w/ transient, subtle STD in V3-V6
   -AM repeat ECG normalizing, cardiac enzymes x2 negative
   -given age and underlying smoking dz is at higher risk for occult CAD
   -will monitor clinically, follow ECGs
   -may need stress eval down the road
   SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING- has hx of sleep apnea but noncompliant w/
   home NIPPV x 2yrs
   -will ask RT to eval for re-initiation of home NIPPV; tolerating fo
   only a few hours
    HIP DISLOCATION- stable post stabilization
   -Ortho consulted; per their rec's needs knee immobilizer

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is persistent abdominal crampy pain, and he did not tolerate NIPPV mask for more than a short while. 

The patient has several significant findings and potential medical complications:

1. Increased white blood cell count.
2. Abdominal crampy pain persistent.
3. DIARRHEA - recurrence of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection is most likely, considering the patient's history of prior C. diff and recent antibiotic use. A stool culture is pending, and the patient will be treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole.

4. HYPOXEMIA - transient hypoxemia with a SpO2 of 94%. No evidence of infiltrate on chest X-ray, so monitoring for edema is recommended due to aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient will also be checked for respiratory viral syndromes.

5. ARF - acute renal failure due to hypovolemia, which is resolving with intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient will continue to be monitored, and nephrotoxins will be avoided.

6. ECG changes - transient, subtle ST depression in leads V3-V6. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative twice, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. Given the patient's age, smoking history"
