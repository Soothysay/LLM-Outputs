 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Presented with anxiety.
   Likely OSA, likely with component of pulmonary HTN, and RV
   dysfunction/failure. Doubt taht he had any acute change as patient
   states his breathing currently is at baseline. He is significantly
   hypoxic on RA while semi asleep. Failed CPAP.
   Trial of Bipap today, very sensitive to significant O2 supplementation.
   Avoid sedating medications. Will check Echo of the heart. Sleep consult

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 901**]
s mental status and ABG worsened over the course of the
   day and the decision was made to intubate him. Discussions were held
   with him and his wife about the logic behind tracheostomy. These
   conversations will be continued. An echo showed a dilated RV though the
   LV could not be visualized. For now, he will continue to be supported
   on the vent and he will be diuresed. The trach will be extremely
   helpful in treating his OSA, hypoxemia, cor pulmonale and RV failure.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and anxiety. They have a history of allergies to penicillins and cephalosporins. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned below.

Upon examination, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5Â°C (99.5Â°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 176/84 to 128/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and they require respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. Their ABG results show a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 84 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240.

Physical examination findings include obesity, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities. The patient also has a candidal appearing rash in the left inguinal fold and a sacral stage I ulcer. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, has purposeful movement, and normal tone.

Laboratory results reveal a white blood cell count of 13.2 g/dL, hemoglobin of 206 K/uL, blood glucose of 126 mg/dL, sodium of 0.6 mg/dL, potassium of 37 mEq/L, chloride of 101 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 14 mg/dL, BUN of 145 mEq/L, creatinine of 41.8%, and platelet count of 8.3 K/uL. Imaging shows a chest X-ray with small bilateral effusion and an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction greater than 40%.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute, likely obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with components of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction/failure. They are significantly hypoxic on RA while semi-asleep and failed CPAP. A trial of bipap was attempted today, but the patient was very sensitive to significant oxygen supplementation. Avoiding sedating medications is recommended. A sleep consult for inpatient sleep study has been requested, and diuresis of -1L empirically has been initiated.

For hypertension, the plan is to titrate up atenolol, aiming for a goal systolic blood pressure below 170 mmHg. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (20-gauge and arterial line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention measures such as head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's head CT shows enlarged ventricles, which may indicate Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) that could worsen his respiratory status and mental status.

The patient underwent intubation due to respiratory failure and became unresponsive overnight. A mucus plug was found on the left side, and the bronchoscope became lodged in the endotracheal tube during bronchoscopy. The patient is now improving after the procedure.

There is a concern for possible pneumonia (PNA) since the patient has secretions and had a fever last night. Serum and urine toxicology screens were negative, so cultures were sent. Treatment for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) with levaquin and vancomycin will be started due to the patient's allergy to penicillins.

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure. Treating the underlying respiratory failure should help improve the mental status. 

The patient has a history of spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and familial essential hypertension (FEN). He is currently on terazosin for BPH. Prophylaxis for deep"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to O2 administration and decreased respiratory drive. The patient has enlarged ventricles on head CT, which may represent normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) that worsens his respiratory status and mental status. He required intubation and had a mucus plug on the left side, necessitating reintubation due to a lodged bronchoscope in the endotracheal tube. The patient's oxygen saturation (Sats) improved after the procedure. There is concern for possible pneumonia (PNA) since the patient has secretions and had a fever last night. Serum and urine tox screens were negative, so cultures were sent. The patient will be treated with levaquin and vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), considering his allergy to penicillins. Monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG) and O2 sats will be done for improvement, and ventilation will be adjusted to keep CO2 levels below 70 and Sats in the high 90s. Sleep study and brain MRI records will be obtained, and the patient will need an inpatient consultation for tracheostomy placement.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), due to OHS/OSA, along with a possible pneumonia on CXR, fever spike overnight, and potential aspiration versus community-acquired pneumonia. The patient has been started on vancomycin and levofloxacin and will continue with nebulizers. Consult for IP tracheostomy has been requested. The ventilator settings have been adjusted to increase TV to 500, plateau of 28, AutoPeep of 8, and set PEEP of 10.

Other potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and changing the airway management strategy may be considered to reduce this risk.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures like compression stockings and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin have been initiated.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers due to the body's stress response. Prophylactic H2 blockers are being used to reduce this risk.

4. Hematuria: The presence of blood in the urine can be caused by various factors, including urinary tract infection or trauma. Further"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of shortness of breath, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing progressive somnolence during the day, and their PCO2 did not recover in the 80s. They were unable to tolerate bipap and were electively intubated via fiberoptic nasal route. Overnight, the patient had desaturation with turn, and a chest X-ray showed collapse of the left lung. A bronchoscopy was performed, with aspiration of a mucous plug from the left mainstem, but the bronchoscope became lodged in the endotracheal tube and required reintubation fiberoptically. The patient also spiked a fever to 100.9 after panculturing. They are currently unable to provide history due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to be suffering from acute respiratory failure, possibly due to OHS/OSA, along with a blossoming pneumonia on the chest X-ray. This could lead to further deterioration of lung function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever spikes, infiltrates on the chest X-ray, and the need for antibiotics suggest that the patient may have pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this could lead to worsening of the respiratory condition and potential sepsis.

3. Aspiration:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and presents with several medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. This could be due to underlying conditions such as OHS (Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome) and OS (Obesity-related Sleep Disorder), along with a possible pneumonia. The patient has been started on vancomycin and levofloxacin, indicating a suspected bacterial infection.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray (CXR), showing infiltrates in the left lower lobe and possibly the right lung fields. This could be either aspiration pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia.

3. Fever: The patient had a spike in fever overnight, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.

4. Intubation: The patient required intubation via fiberoptic nasal route due to progressive somnolence and inability to tolerate BiPAP. This indicates severe respiratory distress.

5. Reintubation: The patient had desaturation with turn and required reintubation fiberoptically because the bronchoscope was lodged in the endotracheal tube (ETT).

6. Head CT: The patient had a head CT showing enlarged ventricles, which might be indicative of increased intracranial pressure or other neurological conditions.

7. Allergies: The patient has allergies to penicillins and cephal"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with PMH of CHF, OSA, OHS presents with SOB and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: secondary to O2 administration and
   decreased respiratory drive. Likely has both OSA and OHS given body
   habitus though never formally evaluated.. Concern for possible PNA
   since pt has secretions.  Vent leak this am improved with repositioning
   of tube.
   - f/u cultures
   - tx for HAP with levaquin/aztreonam and vanco (allergy to PCN)
   - monitor ABG and O2sats for improvement
   - adjust vent to keep CO2 <70 and Sats in high 90s
   - try to obtain OSH MR brain and neuro records
   - will need sleep study once awake
   - appreicate sleep recs
   - CTS to do trach on Monday
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to worsening hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   - treat underlying respiratory failure
   - F/u if any previous Neuro workup
   - Sleep study eventually
   #Urine: very cloudy, possible infection, though appears just hematuria
   - follow to clear
   # Spinal stenosis: stable
   # Achondroplasia: no active issues
   # BPH - on terazosin

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who presents with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has an allergy to penicillins and cephalosporins. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 124/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on various medications including propofol, furosemide (Lasix), and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of secretions and worsening left lower lobe atelectasis on the chest X-ray suggest a possible infection.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): Given the patient's cloudy urine culture and the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters on the sputum gram stain, there is a concern for HAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with PMH of CHF, OSA, OHS presents with SOB and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: secondary to O2 administration and
   decreased respiratory drive. Likely has both OSA and OHS given body
   habitus though never formally evaluated. Head CT with enlarged
   ventricles, though stable from prior head CT, that may be represent NPH
   that worsens his respiratory status and MS. Yesterday he was intuabted
   and during the night had a mucus plug on the left. Then required
   reintubation due ot bronchoscopy becoming lodged in ET tube. Now
   improving sats after this procedure. Concern for possible PNA since pt
   has secretions. Serum and urine tox screens negative.
   - f/u cultures
   - will start tx for HAP with levaquin and vanco (allergy to PCN)
   - monitor ABG and O2sats for improvement
   - adjust vent to keep CO2 <70 and Sats in high 90s
   - try to obtain OSH MR brain and neuro records
   - will need sleep study once awake
   - appreicate sleep recs
   - CTS to do trach on Monday
   # Altered mental status: No evidence of acute infarct on head CT. No
   fevers or elevated WBC to suggest infection. Likely secondary to
   worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - treat underlying respiratory failure
   - F/u if any previous Neuro workup
   - Sleep study eventually
   #Urine: very cloudy, possible infection, ? early ATN
   - f/u UA
   # Spinal stenosis: stable
   # Achondroplasia: no active issues
   # BPH - on terazosin

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient had an enlarged ventricle on head CT, which may represent normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) that worsens his respiratory status and memory loss (MS). He was intubated yesterday and required reintubation due to a mucus plug on the left side. The patient is now improving with better oxygen saturation (sats) after a bronchoscopy procedure. There is concern for possible pneumonia (PNA) since the patient has secretions. Serum and urine tox screens are negative. The patient has allergies to penicillins and cephalosporins. He will be started on treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with levaquin and vancomycin. Monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG) and oxygen saturation (O2sats) is planned for improvement. Ventilator settings will be adjusted to keep carbon dioxide (CO2) below 70 and sats in the high 90s. An obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and neurology consultation will be sought. A sleep study will be done once the patient is awake. A tracheostomy (CTS) will be performed on Monday. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-inch tall individual with a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC), arterial line, and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), as well as decreased hematocrit (Hct) and potassium levels (K+). The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity and respiratory failure, and is being treated for both conditions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheterization can increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of OSA/OHS and pneumonia. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.1Â°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/66 mmHg to 149/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and cephalosporins. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Imaging reveals improved aeration of the lung bases but persistent infiltrates. The patient's extremities have trace edema.

Assessment and Plan:
1. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: Continue wound care.
2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS): Attempt to wean sedation and wean to pressure support, wean FiO2 as tolerated. Maintain at high PEEP. Plan for tracheostomy on Monday in the OR by thoracics. Keep total body balance even. Likely underlying pulmonary hypertension.
3. HTN: Continue home medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate the presence of pneumonia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The chief complaint includes obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), as well as pneumonia. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including diuretics, antibiotics, and respiratory support through mechanical ventilation. The note indicates plans for a tracheostomy to assist with long-term respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs are monitored closely, with temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation levels being recorded. The patient's fluid balance and blood product transfusions are also noted.

Physical examination findings reveal the patient to be overweight or obese, with no acute distress observed. The patient's cardiovascular and respiratory systems are affected, with abnormal breath sounds detected. There is evidence of lower extremity edema, and the patient's neurologic status is described as not following simple commands.

Laboratory results show abnormalities in various parameters, including elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and lactic acid levels. Imaging studies show proper placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and an endotracheal tube positioned at the correct location.

Assessment and plan include addressing impaired skin integrity through wound care, respiratory failure, hypertension, and other ongoing medical conditions. The patient is under full code status and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for critical care management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has an allergy to penicillins and received antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, and aztreonam) for suspected pneumonia. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.8Â°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/69 mmHg to 149/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could indicate a bacterial infection. The preliminary respiratory culture also shows sparse growth of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive. Further investigation is needed to confirm the presence of pneumonia and determine the appropriate course of treatment.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Standard protocols should be followed to prevent and manage this condition.

3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated carbon dioxide levels indicate respiratory"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   51 yo M with PMH of CHF, OSA, OHS presents with SOB and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Significantly improved on vent.
   secondary to O2 administration and decreased respiratory drive. Likely
   has both OSA and OHS given body habitus though never formally
   evaluated.. Concern for possible PNA since pt has secretions and
   occasionally spiking fevers.  FIO2 down to 40%, ABG improving. Concern
   for PNA, sputum with coag + staph, sparse growth.
   - PS trial today
   - f/u culture sensitivity
   - tx for HAP with levaquin/aztreonam and vanco (allergy to PCN), will
   continue until sensitivy returns
   - monitor ABG and O2sats for improvement
   - adjust vent to keep CO2 <70 and Sats in 90s
   - try to obtain OSH MR brain and neuro records
   - will need sleep study once awake
   - appreicate sleep recs
   - CTS to do trach on Monday
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to worsening hypercarbic
   respiratory failure as well as possible NPH.
   - treat underlying respiratory failure
   - F/u if any previous Neuro workup
   - Sleep study eventually
   #HTN: Has been increasing over the past few days.
   - Convert metoprolol from PO to IV
   #Urine: 0 output over last several hours
   - flush foley
   - follow to clear
   # Spinal stenosis: stable
   # Achondroplasia: no active issues
   # BPH - on terazosin
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: tube feeds held due to NGT displaced. Will need to replace
   NGT vs hold off feeds and have PEG tube on Monday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He was admitted to the ICU due to severe respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on positive pressure ventilation with a tidal volume of 473 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and vancomycin. His laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but elevated levels of creatinine and lactate. Chest X-ray findings indicate the endotracheal tube terminating above the carina and no substantial change in the appearance of the chest since the last study. The patient has a positive gram stain for gram-positive cocci in pairs, suggestive of possible pneumonia. Assessment and plan include continued positive pressure ventilation, tracheostomy on Monday, monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG) and oxygen saturation, treatment for staphylococcus in sput"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about possible pneumonia due to occasional spiking fevers and production of secretions. The sputum culture shows the presence of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there is a concern for hyperglycemia in the future. The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure and possible normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The patient's blood pressure has been increasing, and the plan is to convert metoprolol from oral to intravenous administration. Urine output has improved with the use of lasix and flushing. There are no active issues related to spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient requires a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube and tracheostomy (trach) due to his feeding tube being displaced. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with PMH of CHF, OSA, OHS presents with SOB and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Significantly improved on vent.
   Secondary to O2 administration and decreased respiratory drive. Likely
   has both OSA and OHS given body habitus though never formally
   evaluated.. Concern for possible PNA since pt has secretions and
   occasionally spiking fevers.  FIO2 down to 40%, ABG improving. Concern
   for PNA, sputum with coag + staph, sparse growth.
   - continue PS
 CTS to do trach on Monday
   - will need to talk to CTS regarding PEG
   - f/u culture data
   - tx for HAP with levaquin/aztreonam and vanco (allergy to PCN), will
   continue until sensitivy returns
   - monitor ABG and O2sats for improvement
   - adjust vent to keep CO2 <70 and Sats in 90s
   - try to obtain OSH MR brain and neuro records
   - will need sleep study once awake
   - appreciate sleep recs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to worsening hypercarbic
   respiratory failure as well as possible NPH.
   - treat underlying respiratory failure
   - F/u if any previous Neuro workup
   - Sleep study in future
   #HTN: Has been increasing over the past few days.
   - Convert metoprolol from PO to IV

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a known allergy to penicillins and has received antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, and aztreonam) for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). His blood cultures have shown the presence of coagulase-positive staphylococci.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, as well as a rash on the left inguinal fold. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, while platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal range.

Radiological findings include an endotracheal tube terminating 3.6 cm above the carina and no substantial change in chest appearance since the previous study. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition has improved significantly with the use of mechanical ventilation and oxygen administration. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). There is a concern for possible pneumonia given the presence of secretions and occasionally spiking fevers. Sputum culture results are pending.

2. Altered mental status: This may be secondary to worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure and possible normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Treatment for underlying respiratory failure should be continued, and previous neurologic workup should be reviewed.

3. Hypertension: Blood pressure has been increasing over the past few days. Metoprolol should be converted from oral to intravenous administration.

4. GU: Urine output has improved with the use of lasix and flushing.

5. Spinal stenosis: Stable condition.

6. Achondroplasia: No active issues.

7. BPH: The patient is on terazosin.

ICU care includes holding tube feeds due to nasogastric tube displacement, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube will be placed on Monday. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with heparin subcutaneously, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with altered mental status, hypercarbia, and respiratory failure due to OSA/OHS. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and has been switched from CPAP/PSV mode. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 98 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 130/77 mmHg to 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion notes, and clear breath sounds. There is also evidence of right and left lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values, including blood glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes obesity, hypertension, and allergies to penicillins and cephalosporins. The patient is currently being treated for MSSA hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin due to a penicillin allergy. The plan is to continue treating the pneumonia for 8 days and discontinue aztreonam and levofloxacin.

The patient's nutrition is currently NPO, and ent"

   is
   retrocardiac density and linear atelectatic changes as well as left
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No significant interval change versus prior with continued
   findings as described above.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with PMH of CHF, OSA, OHS presents with SOB and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Significantly improved on vent. PS
   weaned down yesterday.  Secondary to O2 administration and decreased
   respiratory drive. Likely has both OSA and OHS given body habitus
   though never formally evaluated.. Concern for possible PNA since pt has
   secretions and occasionally spiking fevers.  Concern for PNA, sputum
   with coag + staph, sparse growth.
   - Trach today by CTS
   - f/u culture data
   - tx for staph in sputum, will continue vanco (allergy to PCN), f/u
   vanco trough
   - monitor ABG and O2sats for improvement
   - try to obtain OSH MR brain and neuro records
   - will need sleep study once awake
   - appreciate sleep recs
   # Fever: 101 overnight
   - f/u culture data
   - trend fever curve
   - send c. diff
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to worsening hypercarbic
   respiratory failure as well as possible NPH.
   - treat underlying respiratory failure
   - F/u if any previous Neuro workup
   - Sleep study in future
   #HTN: Has been increasing over the past few days.
   - Continuet metoprolol from PO to IV
   # GU: Urine output now improved with lasix and flushing
   - monitor
   - flush prn
   - will keep even for now, give lasix 20 Iv if needed
   # Spinal stenosis: stable
   # Achondroplasia: no active issues
   # BPH - on terazosin

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has shown improvement on the ventilator, with decreased respiratory drive and administration of oxygen. There are concerns for possible pneumonia (PNA) due to the presence of secretions and occasional spiking fevers. The patient has an allergy to penicillins and is currently receiving vancomycin for suspected staphylococcus infection in the sputum. His fever persisted overnight, and cultures are pending. The patient also has altered mental status, likely secondary to worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure or possible normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Other issues include hypertension (HTN), improved urine output with lasix and flushing, stable spinal stenosis, no active issues related to achondroplasia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) being managed with terazosin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia (PNA): The presence of secretions, occasional spiking fevers, and growth of coagulase-positive staphylococci in the sputum culture suggests a possible infection.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is significantly improved on the ventilator,"

   IMPRESSION: No significant interval change versus prior with continued
   findings as described above.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with PMH of CHF, OSA, OHS presents with SOB and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Significantly improved on vent. PS
   weaned down yesterday.  Secondary to O2 administration and decreased
   respiratory drive. Likely has both OSA and OHS given body habitus
   though never formally evaluated.. Concern for possible PNA since pt has
   secretions and occasionally spiking fevers.  Concern for PNA, sputum
   with coag + staph, sparse growth.
   - Trach planned by CTS
   - f/u culture data
   - tx for staph in sputum, will continue vanco (allergy to PCN), f/u
   vanco trough
   - monitor ABG and O2sats for improvement
   - try to obtain OSH MR brain and neuro records
   - will need sleep study once awake
   - appreciate sleep recs
   - diurese to aim -1L negative today.
   # Fever: 101.8 overnight
   - f/u culture data
   - trend fever curve
   - send c. diff
   # Constipation: add reglan today. Portable KUB today.
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to worsening hypercarbic
   respiratory failure as well as possible NPH.
   - treat underlying respiratory failure
   - F/u if any previous Neuro workup
   #HTN: Has been increasing over the past few days.
   - Continuet metoprolol from PO to IV
   # GU: Urine output now improved with lasix and flushing
   # Spinal stenosis: stable
   # Achondroplasia: no active issues
   # BPH - on terazosin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS).
- He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient's condition has improved significantly since being placed on a ventilator, and the partial support has been weaned down.
- The patient has a concern for possible pneumonia (PNA) due to secretions and occasional spiking fevers.
- The tracheostomy is planned by thoracics until Wednesday.
- The patient started on d10 at 20cc/hr and was given 20mg IV lasix, but became hypotensive. Repeat 10mg IV lasix was given once blood pressure improved.
- The patient's wife reported that [**Name2 (NI) 1350**] appeared more confluent on extremities and now involving abdomen.
- The patient spiked a low-grade temperature this morning and was cultured.
- The patient is still quite somnolent.
- Allergies include penicillins and anaphylaxis, cephalosporins, and unknown.
- The last doses of antibiotics were aztreonam on [**2134-10-24**] at 05:41 AM, levofloxacin on [**2134-10-24**] at 08:00 AM, and vancomycin on [**2134-10-26**] at 12:42 AM.
- The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion at 50 mcg/kg/min.
- Other ICU medications include famotidine, heparin sodium, metoprolol, furosemide (lasix), and d10.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 137/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm.
- The patient has a fluid balance of 2,050 mL in total input and 2,120 mL in total output.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.
- The physical examination reveals general obesity, peripheral edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin with mild erythema at the lingual fold.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and decreased magnesium levels.
- Radiology images are not provided.
- The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis.
- The assessment and plan include concerns for hypercarbic respiratory failure, possible PNA, fever, constipation, altered mental status, hypertension, and other existing medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has secretions and occasional spiking fevers, which raises concern for possible pneumonia. Cultures have been sent, and appropriate antibiotics have been initiated.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, but there has been significant improvement since being placed on a ventilator.
3. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive after receiving IV lasix, indicating a potential complication related to fluid management.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is still quite somnolent, suggesting a possible underlying cause such as worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure or a neurological condition like normal pressure hydroceph"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with PMH of CHF, OSA, OHS presents with SOB and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Significantly improved on vent. PS
   weaned down yesterday.  Secondary to O2 administration and decreased
   respiratory drive. Likely has both OSA and OHS given body habitus
   though never formally evaluated.. Concern for possible PNA since pt has
   secretions and occasionally spiking fevers.  Concern for PNA, sputum
   with coag + staph, sparse growth.
   - Trach planned by CTS on Wed
   - f/u culture data
   - tx for staph in sputum, will continue vanco (allergy to PCN) x 8
   days, f/u vanco trough
   - monitor ABG and O2sats for improvement
   - try to obtain OSH MR brain and neuro records
   - will need sleep study once awake
   - appreciate sleep recs
   - diurese to aim even to -500 cc today
   - continue current vent settings
   # Fever: continues to have low grade fevers. Likely secondary to
   pneumonia as well as drug [**Month (only) 1350**].
   - f/u culture data
   - trend fever curve
   - resend UA
   # Constipation: continue reglan and BM meds
   #HTN: Has been increasing over the past few days.
   - Continue IV lopressor
   # Spinal stenosis: stable
   # Achondroplasia: no active issues
   # BPH - on terazosin

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presents with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs indicate a low-grade fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. His respiratory support includes being on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%.

The physical examination reveals the following findings:
- General appearance: Overweight/obese
- Eyes/conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils equally round and reactive to light)
- Head, ears, nose, throat: Normocephalic (normal head shape), no abnormalities noted
- Lymphatic: Cervical lymph nodes within normal limits
- Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, bilateral radial and dorsalis pedis pulses present
- Respiratory/chest: Symmetrical chest expansion, diminished breath sounds at the bases
- Extremities: Bilateral lower extremity edema
- Skin: Warm, no other abnormalities noted
- Neurologic: Not assessed

The laboratory results show the following abnormalities:
- Hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL (elevated)
- Hematocrit: 40."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypercarbic respiratory failure. They have been intubated and sedated, with respiratory support provided through CPAP/PSV on the ventilator. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38C (100.4F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/76 to 135/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood cultures showed small white blood cells and negative results for bacteria. They have been receiving multiple antibiotics, including aztreonam, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. The patient has trace edema in their lower extremities and is experiencing extreme fatigue. Their lab results show elevated white blood cell count, potassium levels, and liver enzymes. The patient's nutrition has been compromised due to lack of enteral access, awaiting tracheostomy tube placement and nasogastric tube insertion. The patient's fever is persistent, with no identified source of infection. They are also dealing with acute respiratory failure, MSSA pneumonia, atelectasis/effusions, obstructive sleep apnea, cor pulmonale, and low-grade fevers. The plan moving forward includes tracheostomy, weaning of the ventilator, continuation of antibiotics, monitoring of fever, and insertion of a new nasogastric tube. The patient's condition remains critical."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). The patient presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient remains on antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia, currently on day 7 of vancomycin (Vanc). A tracheostomy is planned by the critical care team (CTS) for today. The patient will continue vancomycin for eight more days, with monitoring of vancomycin trough levels. ABG and oxygen saturation will be monitored for improvement.

The patient's fever curve is trending down, with a maximum temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. This is likely secondary to pneumonia as well as drug rash. C. difficile test is negative. The patient will be monitored for further improvement.

The patient had a small bowel movement yesterday, so constipation is not an issue at this time. The patient will continue with Reglan and bowel movement medications.

The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, and he will continue with IV lopressor.

There are no active issues related to spinal stenosis or achondroplasia. The patient has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and is on terazosin, although not receiving oral medications at the moment.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is NPO for the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and receiving antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia. A tracheostomy is planned for today. The patient's fever curve is trending down, and he had a bowel movement yesterday. His blood pressure is well-controlled with IV lopressor. He has several other medical conditions including spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hypertension. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for a procedure and will have tube feeds placed after the tracheostomy. He is on mechanical ventilation and is being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should implement appropriate measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and daily wake-up calls to minimize this risk.
2. Tracheostomy-related complications: Tracheostomy is a procedure with potential complications such as bleeding, infection, tracheal injury, or displacement of the tracheostomy tube.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is receiving antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient remains on antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia, and a tracheostomy is planned by the Critical Care Team for today. The patient will continue vancomycin (due to an allergy to penicillin) for 8 days and monitor ABG and O2 saturation levels for improvement. Efforts are being made to obtain the patient's medical records from previous brain and neuro consultations, which are still pending. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, aiming for a negative fluid intake of -500 cc today. Current ventilator settings will be continued. The patient continues to have low-grade fevers, likely secondary to pneumonia and possible drug rash. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out. Medications for constipation and bowel movement promotion are ongoing. The patient's blood pressure has been increasing over the past few days, so IV lopressor will be continued. There are no active issues with spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), with the latter being managed with terazosin. In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obstructive hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been on antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia and had a tracheostomy placement. He underwent a tracheostomy mask trial for three hours but was limited by secretions and is now back on the ventilator. Furosemide has been administered for diuresis, as the patient requires negative fluid balance due to pulmonary congestion and left-sided predominant effusion.

The patient's fever curve is trending down, and further bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is planned. He has been diagnosed with constipation, which was negative for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), and is on a bowel regimen. His hypertension is well-controlled, and he will be transitioning to oral lopressor now that oral access has been obtained. The patient's spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are stable without any active issues. The patient's nutrition will start with tube feeding (TF) today.

In terms of ICU care, the patient has a PICC line inserted on October 21st. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been on antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia and remains on this treatment. The tracheostomy collar was attempted but had to be removed due to increased secretions. The patient received negative 800cc at midnight and started on furosemide for diuresis. Three formed stools were observed.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is still on antibiotic therapy, suggesting the presence of possible pneumonia. If the infection spreads or worsens, it can lead to pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary congestion: The patient's pulmonary congestion indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can cause further respiratory distress.
3. Left-sided predominant effusion: The presence of fluid buildup on the left side of the lungs may indicate pleural effusion. If it worsens, it can compromise lung function.
4. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition involves difficulty in breathing and inadequate ventilation, leading to elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This condition requires careful monitoring and management.
5. Diuretic side effects: Furosemide, a diuretic medication, can cause electrolyte imbalances and dehydration if not properly managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presents with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been placed on a tracheostomy collar and is receiving antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia. A chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/61 to 168/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted issues.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and within normal limits for other parameters. Blood cultures have grown Staphylococcus coagulase-negative and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Aerobic bottle gram stain also shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms. Respiratory culture shows no growth, and acid-fast smear and culture are negative.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient appears to be doing well on the tracheostomy collar. He will remain on antibiotic therapy"

24-hour events:
- The patient tried using a tach collar in the morning but tolerated it for only a couple of hours and then had increased secretions.
- Negative 800cc at midnight.
- Started standing lasix.
- Had 3 formed stools.

Medications:
- Famotidine (Pepcid) started on [2134-10-28] at 08:00 PM.
- Morphine sulfate infusion started on [2134-10-29] at 12:00 AM.
- Furosemide (Lasix) started on [2134-10-29] at 04:00 AM.
- Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started on [2134-10-29] at 07:36 AM.

Lab results:

- Hematocrit (Hct): 41.7%
- Platelets (Plt): 216 K/uL
- Creatinine (Cr): 0.6 mg/dL
- TCO2: 34 mmol/L
- Glucose: 111 mg/dL
- Other labs: PT/PTT/INR within normal range, albumin at 3.2 g/dL, calcium at 8.5 mg/dL, magnesium at 1.8 mg/dL, phosphate at 3.7 mg/dL.

Cultures:
- Blood culture from line (sent on 10/26/2134) shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
- Aerobic bottle gram stain (final on 10/27/2134) shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
- Bronchoalveolar lavage gram stain (final on 10/27/2134) shows 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms.
- Respiratory culture (preliminary) shows no growth.
- Acid-fast smear (final on 10/28/2134) shows no acid-fast bacilli.
- Fungal culture (preliminary) shows no fungus isolated.

Assessment and Plan:
- The patient remains on antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia, last day of vancomycin.
- Attempt trach collar today.
- Furosemide for diuresis, needs to be negative given pulmonary congestion and left-sided predominant effusion.
- Fever curve trending down, follow-up BAL.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   He is doing well trach masking this morning. He appear sleepy though is
   arousable and interactive when awake. He reports some dyspnea though
   doesn
t appear in distress.
   The goal going forward will be to have him trach mask for periods as
   long as possible. He is completing his antibiotic course and diuresis
   efforts are continuing. He will be transferred to rehab shortly.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with achondroplasia, obesity, and possibly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who is critically ill in the ICU. He has been experiencing fever and respiratory failure, which may be related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and cephalosporins, and rashes with aztreonam and meropenem, making it difficult to choose appropriate antibiotic coverage.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 139/75mmHg to 107/38mmHg, heart rate between 81-102 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. He is on CPAP mode with a respiratory support device. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The blood cultures show coag-negative Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods, while the sputum culture is pending. Other lab values such as electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and blood glucose levels are within normal ranges.

The patient has a left-sided pleural effusion, which has been waxing and waning since September 16th. A non-contrast CT scan is planned to assess the effusion and determine if a thoracent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone various tests and treatments. The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.4Â°F, indicating a fever. They have a history of allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and have received medications such as lorazepam, furosemide, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 139/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support through a tracheostomy tube and is receiving CPAP mode. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1971 mL and output of 2150 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -179 mL. The patient's weight is 126.9 kg, and their height is 53 inches. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, an elevated glucose level of 156 mg/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal a left-sided pleural effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can be attributed to several factors including habituation to oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), fevers,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure, underwent tracheostomy, and is now tolerating the collar. The patient has been experiencing fever, and a Gram-negative rod (GNR) in sputum suggests new nosocomial pneumonia. He is currently on gentamicin and ciprofloxacin for GNR in sputum for 14 days, as well as vancomycin. A repeat CT scan of the chest is planned today. The patient also has hypercarbic respiratory failure and appears to be doing well on the tracheostomy collar with periodic ventilator support. Standing Lasix will continue today, aiming for a weight loss of -500, and hospital lytes during diuresis will be administered. The patient has had constipation but tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and is on a bowel regimen. His hypertension is well-controlled with atenolol. The patient has stable spinal stenosis, no active issues with achondroplasia, and is being treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with terazosin. In ICU care, the patient is receiving replete nutrition and glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thromb"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed multiple complications.

The patient's recent events include a fever, which has been present for the past 24 hours. Blood cultures were drawn, and tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest were ordered to evaluate for potential hospital-acquired pneumonia or effusion. The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed due to a drug rash, and he is now on ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The goal is to keep the gentamicin trough level below 1.0 before the second dose.

The patient also has a history of penicillin and cephalosporin allergies. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius (101.4 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/56 to 156/83 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on the ventilator.

His fluid balance shows an intake of 2,310 mL and output of 2,070 mL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-inch, 126.9 kg male with a medical history of penicillins and cephalosporins allergy, anaphylaxis to aztreonam, and rash from the last dose of antibiotics (meropenem). The patient presented with fever, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4Â°F, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/56 to 90/23 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and ABG values will be crucial to assess the effectiveness of the ventilator settings and identify any deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Fever: The patient's persistent fever indicates an underlying infection or inflammatory process. Further investigations, such as blood cultures, are necessary to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers. Frequent repositioning, proper wound care, and close monitoring of the skin are essential to"

   (GNR in the sputum from good sample) with left sided effusion which
   appears to have waxed/waned osince 9.16 when it first appeared. Will
   get a non Con CT (to assess if loculated and whether we need to perform
   thoracentesis to sample the space) and also start meropenem given his
   expanded allergy profile for empiric coverage. Also cont Vancomycin
   empiric coverage.   F/u sputum clx. Identitiy.   Also check c. dif
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]);
   Can trial him on TC but has multiple reasons to fail: habitu
   OHV/OSA, fevers, volume overload, deconditioning, PNA and effusion.
   Continue diuresis lasix 40mg iv q6hours (underlying diastolic
   dysfunction) for goal even but he does have insensible losses. In
   addition has this left sided pleural effusion which we will eval as
   above. Empiric CPAP overnight for his sleep disordered breathing and
   assistance with volume overload.

The patient has a fever of 101.4Â°F, and has been diagnosed with coag-negative Staphylococcus in the arterial line, which was subsequently removed. The patient now presents with a left-sided pleural effusion that has waxed and waned since September 16th. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/56 mmHg to 156/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.7Â°C. The patient's weight is currently 126.9 kg, and height is 53 inches. Fluid balance indicates an input of 2,310 mL and output of 2,070 mL.

The patient requires respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and is on CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 32 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 34 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance with no acute distress, normocephalic head, tracheostomy tube, and NG tube in place. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy, and the cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with present radial and dorsalis pedis pulses. The respiratory system examination notes crackles at the lung bases with diminished breath sounds. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities, and the neurologic examination shows attentive behavior with the ability to follow simple commands but no assessment of movement, tone, or other neurologic functions.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 14.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 296 K/uL, platelet count of 296 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 99 to 156 mg/dL, and sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels within normal ranges. Other lab values are also provided in the note.

The patient has an allergy profile that includes penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. The patient has been receiving various medications including meropenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, morphine sulfate, and furosemide.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to the patient's habit of obstructive"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. They have been experiencing a fever of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit and have been receiving various antibiotics including meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. They are on mechanical ventilation support with a tracheostomy tube and are receiving CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode ventilation. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through the tracheostomy tube, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an ABG showing a respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, diminished breath sounds, and mild erythema across the lower extremities. Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci from the A-line catheter, which was subsequently removed. The sputum gram stain showed the presence of gram-negative rods, but no growth was observed in the respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. The patient has been diagnosed with sinusitis and is receiving treatment for it. He also has a history of chronic constipation, hypertension, spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and is on various medications for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has developed a fever and increased sputum production, suggesting a new nosocomial pneumonia. Blood cultures have been sent to identify the causative organism.
2. PICC line infection: There is suspicion of a potential infection in the PICC line due to the presence of a Gram-negative rod on the Gram stain.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Surveillance cultures will be important to monitor for this.
4. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Although the patient appears to be doing well on the tracheostomy collar with periodic vent support, there is still a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the settings are not optimized.
5. Constipation: The patient has a history of chronic constipation, and it needs to be managed appropriately to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure and is now intubated and on a tracheostomy collar. The patient has been experiencing fever, and Gram-negative rods were found in his sputum. He is currently on several antibiotics, including gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The presence of Gram-negative rods in the sputum suggests a new nosocomial pneumonia. The patient is already being treated with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, but vancomycin should also be continued since the patient is still febrile.

2. Sinusitis: The patient's CT scan shows marked worsening of pansinusitis with polypoidal mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus and near complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus. This suggests that the patient's sinusitis is likely covered by the antibiotics he is currently receiving.

3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient appears to be doing well on the tracheostomy collar with periodic ventilator support. However, close monitoring of his respiratory status is essential to prevent further complications.

4. Constipation: The patient has been on a bowel regimen, and his C.diff negative. It is"

   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 901**] with the ICU team, whose note
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that he has been successfully
   transitioned to trach collar trials.  CT showed substantial progression
   of sinus opacity.  Febrile to 101.4.  On exam he is alert and
   interactive (though had some delirium last night).  Breath sounds are
   distant and course.  No facial tenderness or percussion tenderness.

   Assessment and Plan
   51-year-old man with achondroplasia now with respiratory failure and
   recrudescent fever.  The etiology of the fever is not clear.  I doubt
   that this is a line infection given multiple negative sequential
   cultures.  Pneumonia also seems less likely given improved pulmonary
   status, though neither are excluded.  Sinusitis is possible.  Although
   the CT is impressive, it is hard to know if it is infectious or just
   related to obstruction.  We will ask ENT to comment and consider meatal
   sampling/visualization.  In the interim, will continue present ABX,
   nasal decongestion, saline washes, etc.  Sinusitis is a reasonably
   common cause of fever in similar patients (see Crit Care. [**2130**] [**11-8**];9(5):R583-90. Epub [**2130**] [**10-17**]).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with achondroplasia who is critically ill in the ICU. He has a history of OSA/OHS and sinusitis, for which he is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and vancomycin. The patient has allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and a rash occurred with meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.8Â°F), heart rate of 81 bpm (68-97 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 120/51 mmHg to 135/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (16-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV+ApnVol ventilation mode with set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's lab results show hemoglobin level of 12.3 g/dL, white blood cell count of 332 K/uL, blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL, sodium level of 38 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride level of 27 mg/dL, magnesium level of 91 mEq/L, calcium level of 136 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 37.7%, and lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient has been diagnosed with sinusitis and is being treated empirically for MSSA hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), although recent sputum cultures have been negative. There is a mention of substantial progression of sinus opacity on CT scan. The patient's breath sounds are distant and coarse, but there is no facial tenderness or percussion tenderness. The patient's fever is still present.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a need to continue trials for tracheostomy and assess for possible pulmonary complications.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fever despite being on antibiotics. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.

3. Sinusitis: The patient has a history of sinusitis, and there is progression of sinus opacities on the CT scan. This may contribute to the patient's fever and respiratory symptoms.

4. Line Infection: Although the patient has negative peripheral cultures, there is a possibility of a line infection. Blood cultures have been taken, and the patient will attempt to have a line holiday.

5. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with sinusitis. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, spironolactone, terazosin, heparin s/c, colace, chlorhexidine, atenolol, lasix, insulin sliding scale, NaCl nasal spray, and Afrin nasal spray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.8Â°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with a range of 68-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/51 mmHg to 135/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 16-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol ventilation mode.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, platelet count of 216 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 99-156 mg/dL, sodium level of 150 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows a chest X-ray with infiltrate at the right base, and microbiology tests indicate a negative sputum culture for gram-negative rods and negative blood culture.

The patient's assessment includes alterations in nutrition, constipation, fever, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. The plan involves speech and swallow consult, bowel regimen for constipation, continuation of empiric antibiotics, attempts to give a line holiday and place peripheral IV, drainage of the right sinus space, and treatment for MSSA HAP. The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and has a code status of full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode, which may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and is receiving empiric antibiotics, indicating a potential or ongoing infection. There is also a concern for line infection, as evidenced by the attempt to give a line holiday and peripheral IV.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 0.8 mg/dL, indicating possible acute kidney injury.
4. Constipation: The patient has been diagnosed with constipation and is on a bowel regimen, which may lead to complications if not properly managed.
5. Sinusitis: The patient has been diagnosed with sinusitis, which may require further intervention such as drainage of the right sinus space.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 7-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and obstructive hypoventilation. He presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure, underwent tracheostomy, and is currently tolerating the tracheostomy collar. The patient has been on various antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a possible central line infection. His sinusitis has been treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient is also being treated for constipation and hypertension. His spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia are currently stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on invasive ventilation and is being treated for suspected VAP. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
2. Central line infection: The patient has had a PICC line inserted, and there was a concern about a potential infection. Regular monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining proper line care are crucial.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Although the patient appears to be doing well on the tracheostomy collar with periodic vent support, close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Constipation: The patient is on a bowel regimen to manage constipation. Monitoring for improvement in bowel movements and adjusting the treatment as needed is important"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. They have a history of allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and meropenem. The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. They are also receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and furosemide (Lasix). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.2Â°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/41 mmHg to 150/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight has decreased from 135 kg at admission to 126.9 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,531 mL and output of 1,562 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving oxygen through a tracheostomy collar and is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 268 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or peripheral vascular systems, but there are coarse bilateral (bilateral) bronchial sounds in the respiratory system. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there is no lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is incomplete due to the patient's intubation. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hematocrit (Hct), slightly elevated platelet count (Plt), and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) has been steadily increasing since October 27th. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a history of acute respiratory failure. Continued respiratory support may be required, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has not had their skin assessed, but they have a fever, which could indicate an infection or inflammation that may affect the skin.
3. Fever: The patient's temperature is elevated, suggesting an infection or another inflammatory process.
4. Constipation: The patient has a documented alteration in nutrition and is at risk for constipation, particularly due to the use of fos (possibly a medication or intervention).
5. Impaired nutrition: The patient's nutrition may be compromised due to their current condition and possible altered intake."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with achondroplasia presenting with respiratory failure, likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has a history of OSA/OHS and was admitted with respiratory failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, and his secretions have decreased. He has a history of allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and rashes with meropenem. He is receiving multiple antibiotics including gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. Other medications include furosemide, heparin (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/69 to 150/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is slightly overweight with a weight of 126.9 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,531 mL and output of 1,562 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 31 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask with an oxygen saturation of 93%. His ABG results indicate normal values. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds throughout with no wheezing, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender. Peripheral pulses and skin are not assessed. Neuro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He underwent a tracheostomy and is tolerating the collar. The patient has been febrile for the past 24 hours, but the growth of gram-negative rods (GNR) in sputum has not been confirmed. He is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is suspicion of a possible PICC line infection, but blood cultures indicate contamination. The patient's renal function has worsened, and his creatinine level is now at 1.2. His urine electrolytes suggest pre-renal azotemia. Medications are being adjusted accordingly. The patient is doing well on the tracheostomy collar with periodic ventilation support. He is also being treated for sinusitis, acute renal failure (ARF), constipation, hypertension (HTN), spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient's vital signs, lab results, and overall progress are being closely monitored in the ICU. He is awaiting availability of a rehabilitation bed for discharge. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently being treated for VAP, which is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). He presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and subsequently underwent tracheostomy (trach). The patient has been afebrile for 24 hours, and gram-negative rods (GNR) in sputum have not grown. However, he continues to be treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for another 8 days. The possibility of a PICC line infection is being investigated, but blood cultures show coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.2. Medications are being renally dosed, and spironolactone has been discontinued. The patient is also on a bowel regimen, and his blood pressure is well-controlled. Other medical conditions such as spinal stenosis, achondroplasia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are stable and not currently causing active issues. The patient's nutritional intake has been tolerated well, and he is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. His current disposition is in the ICU."

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 901**] with the ICU team.  The ICU team note
   and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**]
s note reflect my input.  I would add/emphasize that
   peripheral IVs were obtained and the PICC was d/c
d.  Tmax down to
   99.4.  Remains off the ventilator.  Creatinine is 1.2, which is a
   substantial increase from baseline but is stable c/w yesterday
   morning.  We will complete empiric therapy for VAP, decreasing gent and
   monitoring.  For sinusitis, we will continue ABX and nasal
   decongestants.  It is not completely clear whether he had bacteremia or
   if they were contaminants; will receive a couple of more days of
   vancomycin.  For renal insufficiency (technically meets criteria for
   acute renal failure, though mild), will hold Lasix.  Other issues as
   per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**] and the ICU team note.  He is transferred to rehab.
   temperature curve has improved a bit.  Remains off the vent, now for
   second day.  ENT consult.  Cough diminished.  On exam he is comfortable
   with coarse breath sounds.  Labs esp notable for HCO3 37, Cr 1.2 (from
   0.6).  For fever (?sinusitis, ?pneumonia), we will continue present
   antibiotics while awaiting cultures.  Pattern of cultures does not
   clearly tell us whether a line infection is present or not; we will
   follow for now as we are unable to obtain peripheral IVs, and risks of
   central line appear to outweigh benefits in this setting.  We will run
   approximately even today, as his creatinine has doubled, indicated
   acute renal failure.  If continues to increase, will need further
   evaluation.  Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**] and the ICU team note.  He
   is ready for screening for rehab, and will need completion of
   antibiotics with appropriate monitoring of levels, follow-up of
   creatinine, follow-up of cultures, and consideration of additional
   vascular access.  Our team has discussed with patient and is calling
   his wife.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with achondroplasia, COPD, VAP, and sinusitis. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications. His vital signs are stable, but he has shown some fluctuations in blood pressure. His oxygen saturation is at 92% and he is on respiratory support. The patient's lab results indicate renal insufficiency and bacteremia. He is being closely monitored for VAP and sinusitis. The plan is to advance his diet, continue with glycemic control, and manage his lines and prophylaxis. The patient's condition is critical, and he will be transferred to a rehab or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has a history of VAP, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteremia indicates an infection in the bloodstream. Prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's lab results show renal insufficiency. It is important to adjust medications accordingly to avoid further kidney damage.
4. Sinusitis: The patient's sinusitis needs to be closely monitored, as it can potentially lead to complications such as orbital cellulitis or intracranial infections.
5. COPD exacerbation:"
