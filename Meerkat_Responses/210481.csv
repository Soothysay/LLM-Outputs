   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck/fall
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for airway
   monitoring, now with acute respiratory failure.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction. it is most
   likely that she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary
   edema.  Other etiologies include aspiration or secretions or blood from
   trach site, complicated by ARDS, though the improvement on CXR this
   morning makes this less likely.  She is at risk for PE, but there are
   no signs of right heart strain on EKG and the bilateral patchy
   infiltrates are not typical of PE.   She has been afebrile and without
   leukocytosis so pneumonia is unlikely.  There may also be a cardiogenic
   aspect to her respiratory status, though EGK remained unchanged
   -Continue intubation for oxygenation.  Wean PEEP to 10 which will
   hopefully allow us to wean off pressors.  Maintain O2 Sats >90 given
   patient
s home O2 sats are in this range on 2-3L.
   -Serial CXR
   -Bronchial aspirate for culture
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes x3
   -TTE
   -OG tube for meds and feeding.
   # Neck swelling s/p fistula takedown: Pt has improved facial, neck &
   chest wall swelling due to air leak around tracheal opening and
   tracking subcutaneous emphysema.  Some sutures removed last night
   during code.  ENT has placed a dressing over the trach, but unclear if
   she will need to go back to the OR.
   - Codeine 15mg q4hr to prevent cough
   - f/u ENT recs
   - Vicoden & Morphine prn pain
   - holding on ASA until seen in f/u by ENT (approx 1wk)
   .
   # CAD/CHF: Pt with long standing CAD s/p CABG/PCI in [**2133**], EKG
   suggestive of old inferior MI and ECHO from [**5-28**] with EF of 50% and
   inferolateral hypokinesis.  No evidence of volume overload on admission
   to the ICU and pt denie any chest pain/jaw pain. Pt is mildly
   tachycardic in 100s and hypertensive, likely secondary to pain and
   anxiety.
   - repeat EKG this AM
   - hold BB given hypotension, lasix and ACE also held.
   - holding ASA per ENT
   .
   # COPD/Pulm: Pt carries a diagnosis of COPD but uses only albuterol prn
   and no prior PFTs in OMR.  She had been using 2-3L home oxygen.  No
   audible wheezes on exam upon admission, but diffuse upper airway
   congestion.  Patient received combivent overnight, and should continue
   to get nebs PRN
   .
   # OSA: Once extubated, will hold on CPAP/BIPAP given ongoing tracheal
   leak with subcutaneous air tracking through chest wall/face/neck
   - supplemental oxygen only
   .
   # Anxiety/Bipolar disorder: Pt anxious due to post-op facial
   swelling/pain with swallowing
   - once OG in place, continue Quetiapine 25mg TID with 100mg qhs down
   tube
   - continue Zoloft 100mg in am - Ativan 0.5mg IV TID prn (hold for
   sedation) down tube
   .
   # FEN: Place OG, careful aspiration precaustions.
   - f/u lytes and replete prn
   .
   # PPx: Pneumoboots (no heparin given HIT history), IV PPI while NPO
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Code:  FULL confirmed with patient
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU until patient stable from respiratory standpoint.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure who underwent an elective takedown of a tracheocutaneous fistula. The patient developed diffuse neck/facial swelling and subcutaneous emphysema postoperatively, leading to admission to the ICU for airway monitoring. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's blood pressure is in the 110s, heart rate is in the 80s, respiratory rate is set at 18 breaths per minute with spontaneous breaths not recorded, and oxygen saturation is maintained above 90%. Crackles are heard bilaterally throughout the lung fields, and there is subcutaneous air with crepitus over the chest and shoulders and neck, with decreased subQ air in the left face, none in the right face. No focal neurologic deficits are noted, and pedal pulses are 1+. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.9, hematocrit of 38.8, platelet count of 282, creatinine of 1.0, and glucose of 130. Other labs include PT/PTT/INR, differential cell counts, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and cardiac enzymes. The patient has been on fentanyl and midazolam sedation. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: Unclear etiology, possibly due to acute airway obstruction, pulmonary edema, aspiration of secretions or blood from tracheal site, or complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient will continue to be intubated for oxygenation, with PEEP weaned to 10, and O2 saturation maintained above 90%.
2. Neck swelling post-fistula takedown: The patient has improved facial, neck, and chest wall swelling due to air leak around tracheal opening and subcutaneous emphysema. Some sutures were removed during the code, and ENT has placed a dressing over the tracheostomy site. The need for further surgical intervention will be determined by ENT.
3. CAD/CHF: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG/PCI and an ejection fraction of 50%. No evidence of volume overload is noted, and the patient denies chest pain or jaw pain. She is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive, likely secondary to pain and anxiety. Repeat EKG and further evaluation are planned.
4. COPD: The patient uses albuterol as needed and no prior pulmonary function tests are available. She had been using 2-3 liters of home oxygen. No audible wheezes are noted on examination. Combivent will be continued, and nebulizers will be given as needed.
5. OSA: Once extubated, the patient will hold on CPAP/BIPAP due to ongoing tracheal leak with subcutaneous air tracking through the chest wall/face/neck.
6. Anxiety/Bipolar disorder: The patient is anxious due to postoperative facial swelling/pain with swallowing. Once an orogastric tube is in place, quetiapine will be continued, along with Zoloft and Ativan as needed.
7. FEN: An orogastric tube will be placed, and aspiration precautions will be taken.
8. PPx: Pneumoboots will be given without heparin due to a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor and aggressive bowel regimen will be implemented.

Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU until stable from a respiratory standpoint."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. She underwent a tracheostomy wean and elective takedown of a tracheocutaneous fistula. Postoperatively, she developed diffuse neck/facial swelling and subcutaneous emphysema due to an air leak around the tracheal opening. She presented to the ICU for airway monitoring and is currently intubated on a face mask with supplemental oxygen. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with unclear etiology. Her history of OSA/tracheobronchial malacia suggests that this may be the likely cause. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and airway patency is recommended. If the airway becomes compromised, endotracheal intubation should be considered.

2. Neck Swelling: The patient has diffuse facial, neck, and chest wall swelling due to subcutaneous air tracking from the tracheal opening. This is causing subcutaneous emphysema. Pain with swallowing is more likely due to soft tissue manipulation during surgery rather than an air leak compressing esophageal structures.

3. CAD/CHF: The patient has a history of CAD with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). An EKG shows an old inferior myocard"

   Acute respiratory decompensation (hypoxemia)
   ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- suspect acute airway obstruction (rapidly
   reversible) or acute pulmonary edema.  Also consider pulmonary
   embolism, but CXR markedly abnormal and most consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Underlying tracheobronchomalacia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, wean FIO2, PEEP, maintaining SaO2 >88%.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES, diffuse -- concerns for ARDS, and acute
   cardiogenic pulmonary or pulmonary edema in context of modified [**Doctor Last Name 4607**]
   manuver.  [**Month (only) 60**] be focal RML infiltrate, suggesting pneumonia or
   aspiration.
   TRACHEOCUTANEOUS FISTULA -- ENT surgery to reassess; possible need to
   return to OR.  Uncertain whether tracheotomy tube necessary at this
   time.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear etiology.  In part related to medications at
   time of intubation, but persistent and vasopressors required -->
   concern for evolving sepsis.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema, and complicated by
   OSA.
   CAD -- ECG changes c/w ischemia.
   HIT Ab positive -- avoid heparin.
   SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA -- resolving (facial swelling especially
   improved).
   OSA -- would like to resume CPAP.
   ANXIETY DISORDER -- resume versed.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient presented with an upper airway obstruction and required invasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, and multi-lumen placement. They experienced hypotension and were given vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient also had low oxygen saturation (<80%) with dyspnea and cyanosis, leading to the placement of an endotracheal tube (ETT) by Anesthesiology. Bilateral infiltrates were seen on a chest X-ray (CXR), indicating potential pulmonary edema.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. They are currently on antibiotics and sedated, unable to provide their own history. The patient's pain level is minimal at the neck surgical incision site.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 130/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal conjunctiva, and no signs of edema or cyanosis. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse and no murmurs. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with crackles in both lungs. Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute respiratory decompensation (hypoxemia)
   ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- suspect acute airway obstruction (rapidly
   reversible) or acute pulmonary edema.  Also consider pulmonary
   embolism, but CXR markedly abnormal and most consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Underlying tracheobronchomalacia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, wean FIO2, PEEP, maintaining SaO2 >88%.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES, diffuse -- concerns for ARDS, and acute
   cardiogenic pulmonary or pulmonary edema in context of modified [**Doctor Last Name 4607**]
   manuver.  [**Month (only) 60**] be focal RML infiltrate, suggesting pneumonia or
   aspiration.
   TRACHEOCUTANEOUS FISTULA -- ENT surgery to reassess; possible need to
   return to OR.  Uncertain whether tracheotomy tube necessary at this
   time.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear etiology.  In part related to medications at
   time of intubation, but persistent and vasopressors required -->
   concern for evolving sepsis.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema, and complicated by
   OSA.
   CAD -- ECG changes c/w ischemia.
   HIT Ab positive -- avoid heparin.
   SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA -- resolving (facial swelling especially
   improved).
   OSA -- would like to resume CPAP.
   ANXIETY DISORDER -- resume versed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has experienced multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which are consistent with acute respiratory failure. This may be due to acute airway obstruction, acute pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, or underlying tracheobronchomalacia.

2. Pulmonary infiltrates: The presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates suggests the possibility of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) or acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Focal right middle lobe infiltrate may indicate pneumonia or aspiration.

3. Tracheocutaneous fistula: The patient has a tracheocutaneous fistula, which may require surgical intervention to reassess and possibly perform a tracheotomy.

4. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension that is unclear in etiology. It is related to medications given at the time of intubation and may be a sign of evolving sepsis. Vasopressors are required to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is attributed to acute pulmonary edema and complicated by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's condition is being managed with mechanical ventilation and adjustments to FiO2 and PEEP.

6. CAD (coronary artery"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck/fall
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for airway
   monitoring, now with acute respiratory failure.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction. it is most
   likely that she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary
   edema.  Other etiologies include aspiration or secretions or blood from
   trach site, complicated by ARDS, though the improvement on CXR this
   morning makes this less likely.  She is at risk for PE, but there are
   no signs of right heart strain on EKG and the bilateral patchy
   infiltrates are not typical of PE.   She has been afebrile and without
   leukocytosis so pneumonia is unlikely.  There may also be a cardiogenic
   aspect to her respiratory status, though EGK remained unchanged.
   -Continue intubation for oxygenation.  Wean PEEP to 10 which will
   hopefully allow us to wean off pressors.  Maintain O2 Sats >90 given
   patient
s home O2 sats are in this range on 2-3L.
   -Serial CXR
   -Bronchial aspirate for culture
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes x3
   -TTE
   -OG tube for meds and feeding.
   # Neck swelling s/p fistula takedown: Pt has improved facial, neck &
   chest wall swelling due to air leak around tracheal opening and
   tracking subcutaneous emphysema.  Some sutures removed last night
   during code.  ENT has placed a dressing over the trach, but unclear if
   she will need to go back to the OR.
   - Codeine 15mg q4hr to prevent cough
   - f/u ENT recs
   - Vicoden & Morphine prn pain
   - holding on ASA until seen in f/u by ENT (approx 1wk)
   .
   # CAD/CHF: Pt with long standing CAD s/p CABG/PCI in [**2133**], EKG
   suggestive of old inferior MI and ECHO from [**5-28**] with EF of 50% and
   inferolaeral hypokinesis.  No evidence of volume overload on admission
   to the ICU and pt denie any chest pain/jaw pain. Pt is mildly
   tachycardic in 100s and hypertensive, likely secondary to pain and
   anxiety.
   - repeat EKG this AM
   - hold BB given hypotension, lasix and ACE also held.
   - holding ASA per ENT
   .
   # COPD/Pulm: Pt carries a diagnosis of COPD but uses only albuterol prn
   and no prior PFTs in OMR.  She had been using 2-3L home oxygen.  No
   audible wheezes on exam upon admission, but diffuse upper airway
   congestion.  Patient received combivent overnight, and should continue
   to get nebs PRN
   .
   # OSA: Once extubated, will hold on CPAP/BIPAP given ongoing tracheal
   leak with subcutaneous air tracking through chest wall/face/neck
   - supplemental oxygen only
   .
   # Anxiety/Bipolar disorder: Pt anxious due to post-op facial
   swelling/pain with swallowing
   - once OG in place, continue Quetiapine 25mg TID with 100mg qhs down
   tube
   - continue Zoloft 100mg in am - Ativan 0.5mg IV TID prn (hold for
   sedation) down tube

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure with an unclear etiology. Possible causes include upper airway obstruction, aspiration or secretions, pulmonary edema, or a cardiogenic aspect.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient is at risk for PE, there are no signs of right heart strain on EKG, and the bilateral patchy infiltrates are not typical of PE. However, further evaluation and monitoring are necessary.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has been afebrile and without leukocytosis, making pneumonia less likely. Serial chest X-rays and bronchial aspirate culture can help rule out this possibility.

4. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous cardiac events, there may be a cardiogenic aspect to her respiratory status. EKG changes and cardiac enzyme levels should be monitored closely.

5. Tracheocutaneous Air Leak: The patient had a persistent tracheocutaneous air leak following the tracheostomy, leading to facial, neck, and chest wall swelling due to air tracking subcutaneously. This complication may require further evaluation and intervention.

6. Neck Swelling: The patient developed facial, neck, and chest wall swelling after the fistula takedown surgery. This could be due to air leak around the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of CAD, COPD, and respiratory failure who presented for an elective takedown of tracheoesophageal fistula. She had a complicated postoperative course with diffuse neck/facial swelling and subcutaneous emphysema. She was admitted to the ICU for airway monitoring and is now experiencing acute respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 141/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450-540 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and RSBI of 73. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.23.

Physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally throughout the lung fields, subcutaneous air with crepitus over the chest and shoulders, neck, and left face, but not in the right face. The patient is awake, alert, and responsive appropriately. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits and she is able to move all four extremities. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 9.9, Hct of 38.8%, platelet count of 232,000/mm3, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.04, and glucose of 130 mg/dL. Other lab values include a PT of 13.3, PTT of 35.8, INR of 1.1, CK of 117, CKMB of 6, and calcium level of 8.7 mg/dL. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may be due to unclear etiology, possibly related to airway obstruction, pulmonary edema, aspiration, or tracheal site bleeding. She will continue to be intubated for oxygenation, with PEEP reduced to 5 to prepare for extubation on Monday. Serial chest X-rays, bronchial aspirate culture, diuresis with 1L/day, and ENT recommendation to keep intubated for 3 days will be implemented.

2. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped by 8 points overnight, with all counts nearly cut in half. This may be spurious, and a repeat stat CBC is recommended. Guaiac stools and transfusion if below 25 should also be considered.

3. Neck swelling post-fistula takedown: The patient has improved facial, neck, and chest wall swelling due to air leak around the tracheal opening and tracking subcutaneous emphysema. Codeine will be given to prevent"

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. She presented for elective takedown of a tracheocutaneous fistula but experienced complications during the procedure, including diffuse neck/facial swelling and subcutaneous emphysema. She was admitted to the ICU for airway monitoring and is now experiencing acute respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level dropped significantly overnight, indicating acute blood loss or spurious results. Further investigation is needed, including a repeat CBC, guaiac stool test, and consideration for blood transfusion if necessary.

3. Neck Swelling: The patient has improved facial, neck, and chest wall swelling due to air leak around the tracheal opening and tracking subcutaneous emphysema. Codeine has been prescribed to prevent coughing, and ENT recommendations suggest keeping the patient intubated for three days to allow the tract to heal.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck and face
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema.  Course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Stable.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction. it is most
   likely that she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary
   edema.  Other etiologies include aspiration or secretions or blood from
   trach site. She has been afebrile and without leukocytosis so pneumonia
   is unlikely.  There may also be a cardiogenic aspect to her respiratory
   status, BNP is increased to 1800, though Echo showed EF of 60%.
   -Continue intubation for oxygenation.  Wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 5
   which will hopefully allow us to be ready to extubate on Monday.
   Maintain O2 Sats >90 given patient
s home O2 sats are in this range on
   2-3L.
   -Serial CXR
   -f/u Bronchial aspirate for culture
   - goal diuresis -1L (as long as blood pressure stable)
   - ENT recommends keeping intubated 3 days (until Monday) to allow
   tracheocutaneous tract to heal.  Plane to extubate under direct
   visualization.
   #Fever: Spiked to 100.9 overnight, GPCs in blood cultures from [**9-12**].
   Also concern for cellulitis on neck around trach site.  Area of
   erythema is not expanding this morning. Also some concern for pulmonary
   source of infection.
   -Continue Vanco for GPC+ bc, Possible hospital acquired cellulitis(day
   2)
   -Monitor fever curve and WBC curve
   -if patient continues to spike, or if any change on CXR would do
   mini-BAL and broaden to Vanc/Zosyn for VAP
   -f/u trach aspirate
   #Anemia: Pt with 8 pt hct drop Friday night-Sat morning.  Rechecked Sat
   PM (without intervention) and was increased, so likely spurious result
   (all counts cut were nearly in half).  Would be concerned for pulmonary
   bleeding or bleeding from trach site if repiratory status worsened or
   if CXR showed interval worsening.
   -q12h CBC
   -guiac stools
   -transfuse if <25
   # Neck swelling s/p fistula takedown: Pt has improved facial, neck &
   chest wall swelling due to air leak around tracheal opening and
   tracking subcutaneous emphysema.
   - Codeine 15mg q4hr to prevent cough
   - fentanyl versed gtt
s for pain/sedation
   - f/u ENT recs
   - ENT rec keep intubated for 3 days so tract can heal
   .
   # CAD/CHF: Pt with long standing CAD s/p CABG/PCI in [**2133**], EKG
   suggestive of old inferior MI.  No evidence of volume overload on
   admission to the ICU and pt denie any chest pain/jaw pain. Tachycardia
   improved yesterday, BNP 1800.
   -Echo with EF of 60% and ? Hypokinesis of inferior/lateral wall
   -Diurese with Lasix with goal -1L for 24 hours as long as SBP>100
   - consider restarting BB today if HR>60 and SBP >100 after lasix
   - Restarted ASA by OGT
   -Hold ACE
   # COPD/Pulm: Pt carries a diagnosis of COPD but uses only albuterol prn
   and no prior PFTs in OMR.  She had been using 2-3L home oxygen.  No
   audible wheezes on exam, but diffuse upper airway congestion.
   - Continue Nebs PRN
   .
   # OSA: Once extubated, while hold on CPAP/BIPAP given ongoing tracheal
   leak with subcutaneous air tracking through chest wall/face/neck
   .
   - supplemental oxygen only
   .
   # Anxiety/Bipolar disorder: Pt anxious due to post-op facial
   swelling/pain with swallowing
   - OG in place, continue Quetiapine 25mg TID with 100mg qhs down tube
   - continue Zoloft 100mg in am - Ativan 0.5mg  TID prn (hold for
   sedation) down tube

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy closure. She presented with diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been febrile, with a spike in temperature to 100.9°F, and has GPC clusters in blood cultures from 9/12. There is concern for cellulitis around the tracheostomy site, and the area of erythema is not expanding. The patient's respiratory status has improved with FiO2 weaned to 55% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. The plan is to extubate the patient tomorrow under direct visualization. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had an acute respiratory failure requiring intubation, and there is uncertainty regarding the etiology. It could be due to upper airway obstruction, pulmonary edema, aspiration, or infection at the tracheostomy site.
2. Infection: The patient has been febrile, with a spike in temperature to 100.9°F, and has GPC clusters in blood cultures from 9/12. There is concern for hospital-acquired cellulitis and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Anemia: The patient experienced an 8-point drop in hemat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. She underwent tracheostomy weaning but developed a persistent tracheocutaneous air leak. The patient then presented for elective takedown of the fistula but experienced complications during the procedure, including diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with unclear etiology. Possible causes include upper airway obstruction, aspiration of secretions or blood from the tracheostomy site, or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters need close monitoring, and weaning of FiO2 and PEEP should be done cautiously.

2. Fever and Possible Infection: The patient had a fever spike to 100.9°F overnight, raising concerns for cellulitis around the tracheostomy site. There is also a possibility of a pulmonary source of infection. Continuing Vancomycin for hospital-acquired cellulitis and monitoring fever and white blood cell count curves is recommended. Broadening antibiotics to cover ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and performing mini-balloon aspiration if the fever persists or there are changes on chest X-ray is advisable.

3. Anemia: The patient experienced an 8-point"

   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck and face
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema.  Course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Stable.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction. it is most
   likely that she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary
   edema.  Other etiologies include aspiration or secretions or blood from
   trach site. She has been afebrile and without leukocytosis so pneumonia
   is unlikely.  There may also be a cardiogenic aspect to her respiratory
   status, BNP is increased to 1800, though Echo showed EF of 60%.
   -Continue intubation for oxygenation.  Wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 5

   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck and face
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema.  Course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Stable.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction. it is most
   likely that she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary
   edema.
   -Successfully weaned to FiO2 to 40%, [**10-26**].  RSBI this AM was 45.  SBT
   now.  Will consider extubation with ENT if patient tolerates SBT

   take her back to the OR.
   #Fever: Continued to spike fever yesterday and overnight, GPCs in blood
   cultures from [**9-12**].  Also concern for cellulitis on neck around trach
   site.  Area of erythema is not expanding this morning. Also some
   concern for VAP.  Cefazolin d/c

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. She underwent tracheostomy and was in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) when she developed diffuse neck and face swelling, as well as subcutaneous emphysema. The swelling was due to an air leak around the tracheal opening. She required intubation due to acute respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has been experiencing fever spikes and has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci (GPCs). There is concern for hospital-acquired cellulitis around the tracheostomy site and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has anemia with a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) levels. Her condition is complicated by persistent tracheocutaneous air leak and subcutaneous emphysema. 

The patient's cardiac history includes coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There are signs of old inferior myocardial infarction on the electrocardiogram (EKG). 

Other medical issues include bipolar disorder, anxiety, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OSA). 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin), analgesics (fentanyl and loraz"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy weaning. She presented for elective takedown of fistula but experienced complications including diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 117/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on FiO2 40%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 44.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, elevated creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 184 K/uL. The patient also has elevated troponin-T levels, lactic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and hypermagnesemia.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure of unclear etiology"

   Assessment and Plan
   Upper airway obstruction, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- not yet ready for extubation.  Good progress
   with ventilator support, but with clinical evidence for persistent
   tracheocutaneous fistula.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION
 subglottic obstruction, <30%, may be
   contributing to airway distress.  Bypassed with ETT.
   TRACHEOCUTANEOUS FISTULA -- post-op maipulated in context of acute
   resp. distress.  Need to check with ENT to determine whether requires
   revision.  Wound infected.
   SUBCUTANEOUS AIR -- suggests persistent air leak.  Monitor exam.
   BACTEREMIA -- staph coag negative.  Likely related to tracheotomy.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   FLUIDS
 euvolemic.  Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is still intubated and mechanically ventilated, remaining off vasopressor. The patient complains of pain in the area of the tracheotomy flap. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, and nausea/vomiting from Percocet (oxycodone HCl/acetaminophen).

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam (versed), furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and lorazepam (Ativan). The patient's medical and family history, review of systems, and physical examination findings are unchanged from admission except for the noted above and below.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/56 to 133/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's blood cultures were obtained at 05:29 PM on 09/14/2138, and a pan culture was obtained at 04:00 AM on 09/15/2138. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 09/13/2138 at 01:52 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 09/15/2138 at 06:39 AM.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 44. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH = 7.30, PaCO2 = 45 mmHg, PaO2 = 80 mmHg, HCO3- = 30 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) = -2 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals crepitus around the tracheotomy incision, warm and dry skin without rash or jaundice, and normal neurologic examination findings. The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hgb) of 10.1 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 9.9 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 232 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 130 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.04 ng/mL.

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- not yet ready for extubation
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION --
   TRACHEOCUTANEOUS FISTULA -- post-op maipulated in context of acute
   resp. distress.  Need to check with ENT to determine whether requires
   revision.  Wound infected.
   SUBCUTANEOUS AIR -- suggests persistent air leak.
   BACTEREMIA -- staph coag negative.  Likely related to tracheotomy.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. They have a tracheotomy site infection with subcutaneous air, suggesting a persistent air leak. There is also evidence of bacteremia caused by staphylococcus coagulase-negative, which is likely related to the tracheotomy. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever and low blood pressure. They are currently on mechanical ventilation and have been intubated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Tracheocutaneous fistula: The infection at the tracheotomy site may lead to the development of a tracheocutaneous fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the trachea and the skin.
2. Persistent air leak: The presence of subcutaneous air suggests a persistent air leak, which can compromise the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation and increase the risk of lung injury.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection.
4. Bacteremia and sepsis: The bacteremia caused by staphylococcus coagulase-negative indicates a systemic infection, which can progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
5. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged ICU stay can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, especially in areas of increased pressure such as the sacrum or heels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure who presented for elective tracheostomy takedown. She had a postoperative course complicated by diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and an unclear etiology of respiratory failure. She has been intubated for five days and is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs show a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 103/52 to 90/42 mmHg, heart rate between 71-88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis, and septic shock. She has received various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and sedatives. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient also has multiple comorbidities such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation time and fever, there is a concern for VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck and face
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema.  Course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Stable.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction. it is most
   likely that she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary
   edema.
   Desaturation last night that did not respond to suctioning,  requiring
   increased vent settings.  Possible that it is related to worsening
   VAP/infection, but also concern for PE, problem with tube placement,
   secretions.
   -Given worsening respiratory status overnight, and lack of cuff leak
   this morning, today will try to wean Fi02 and PEEP, plan for RSBI and
   SBT this PM if she tolerates.
   -Maintain O2 Sats >90 given patient

   #Fever: Continued to spike fever yesterday and overnight, with multiple
   possible sources of infectio including blood, skin around trach site
   and lungs.  GPCs in blood from Thursday night, no growth since then.
   Increased secretions, length of intubation and mini-BAL results
   concerning for VAP.  Trach site tender, dressings changed frequently,
   but area of erythema not expanding, possible cellulitis vs.
   irritation.  Cefazolin d/c
d Saturday, started on Vanco Saturday with
   increased dose starting Monday.  Started on Zosyn Monday night.
   -Continue Vanco/Zosyn, narrow coverage when sensitivities returns.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of CAD, COPD, and respiratory failure who underwent a tracheostomy wean but developed persistent tracheocutaneous air leak. She presented for elective takedown of the fistula but experienced complications including diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.

- The patient has been experiencing ongoing respiratory issues, including desaturation last night that did not respond to suctioning, requiring increased vent settings. This could be related to worsening ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), problem with tube placement, or secretions.

- The patient continues to spike fevers, which are concerning for infection, including blood, skin around tracheostomy site, and lungs. Mini-balloon (mini-BAL) results are concerning for VAP. The tracheostomy site is tender, and dressings are changed frequently, but there is no expansion of erythema, suggesting possible cellulitis versus irritation. Cefazolin was discontinued, and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) were started.

- The patient has anemia but is now stable. Transfusion is recommended if the hemoglobin level is less than 25.

- The patient's neck swelling has improved since"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck and face
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema.  Course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Stable.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction. it is most
   likely that she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary
   edema.
   Desaturation last night that did not respond to suctioning,  requiring
   increased vent settings.  Possible that it is related to  increased
   secretions and derecruitment, worsening VAP/infection, but also low
   level of concern for PE.
   - will try to wean Fi02 and PEEP, plan for RSBI and SBT this.
   Extubation will be done by IP in the OR, IP and ENT following.
   -Maintain O2 Sats >90 given patient
s home O2 sats are in this range on
   2-3L.

   -f/u culture data and sensitivities
   -f/u ENT recs
   #Fever: Continued to spike fever yesterday and overnight, with multiple
   possible sources of infection including blood, skin around trach site
   and lungs.  GPCs in blood from Thursday night, no growth since then.
   Increased secretions, length of intubation and mini-BAL results
   concerning for VAP.  Trach site tender, dressings changed frequently,
   but area of erythema not expanding, possible cellulitis vs.
   irritation.  Cefazolin d/c
d Saturday, started on Vanco Saturday with
   increased dose starting Monday.  Started on Zosyn Monday night.
   -Continue Vanco/Zosyn,  if spikes fever today will consider broadening
   coverage with ceftazadime.

   # Neck swelling s/p fistula takedown: Pt has improved facial, neck
   swelling due to air leak around tracheal opening and tracking
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Still with crepitus over chest wall.
    -f/u ENT recs. Likely will trial extubation in the OR and if fails,
   may need permanent tracheostomy.
   # CAD/CHF: Pt with long standing CAD s/p CABG/PCI in [**2133**], EKG
   suggestive of old inferior MI.  No evidence of volume overload on
   admission to the ICU and pt denie any chest pain/jaw pain. Tachycardia
   improved yesterday, BNP 1800.
   -Echo with EF of 60% and ? Hypokinesis of inferior/lateral wall

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure who presented for elective takedown of a tracheocutaneous fistula. She experienced diffuse neck and face swelling with subcutaneous emphysema post-procedure, which was complicated by acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypoxia, and tachycardia. She has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and nutritional support. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains in the ICU until she is stable from a respiratory standpoint.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of intubation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Frequent suctioning, position changes, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are important in preventing or treating this condition.

3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. It is crucial to identify the source of infection through cultures and provide appropriate antibiotic coverage.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be monitored and managed accordingly. Blood transfusions may be required if the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's sputum production has increased, which suggests tracheobronchitis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/45 mmHg to 119/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 464 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. They have received antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin, for suspected bacteremia related to the tracheal wound and possible respiratory tract infection. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, elevated troponin-T levels, and slightly abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck and face
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema and acute respiratory failure
   requiring intubation.  Improved.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction. it is most
   likely that she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary
   edema.  Tolerated SBP last night, improving RSBIs.  Awaiting ENT/IP
   recs for extubation.
   - SBT today. Disucss extubation with ENT/IP.
   -Maintain O2 Sats >90 given patient

   2-3L.
   -Serial CXR
   -Diurese -500ml today if SBP stable (with lasix)
   -f/u ENT recs
   #Fever: Afebrile for 24 hour, surveillance blood cultures negative,
   skin around trach site improving. All cultures growing MRSA. Vanco day
   5, Zosyn day 3.
   -Continue Vanco for total 14 day course given positive blood cultures
   and possible VAP. D/C Zosyn
   -f/u blood cultures, urine cultures and mini-BAL culture sensitivities.

   emphysema.
     -f/u ENT recs. Likely will trial extubation in the OR and if fails,
   may need permanent tracheostomy.
   #Pain: Yesterday, patien put back on PO meds, tolerating well.
   -Continue home vicodin down NG tube
   # CAD/CHF: Pt with long standing CAD s/p CABG/PCI in [**2133**], EKG
   suggestive of old inferior MI.  No evidence of volume overload on
   admission to the ICU and pt denie any chest pain/jaw pain. Tachycardia
   improved yesterday, BNP 1800.
   -Echo with EF of 60% and ? Hypokinesis of inferior/lateral wall
   - ACE  as long as  if HR>60 and SBP >100 after lasix
   - Continue ASA by OGT
   - Hold BB
   # COPD/Pulm: Pt carries a diagnosis of COPD but uses only albuterol prn
   and no prior PFTs in OMR.  She had been using 2-3L home oxygen.  No
   audible wheezes on exam, but diffuse upper airway congestion.
   - Continue Nebs PRN
   # OSA: Once extubated, while hold on CPAP/BIPAP given ongoing tracheal
   leak with subcutaneous air tracking through chest wall/face/neck
    - supplemental oxygen only
   # Anxiety/Bipolar disorder: History of anxiety, bipolar.  Exacerbated
   by anxiety over intubation and possibility of permanent trach.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of CAD, COPD, and respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy weaning but developed a persistent tracheocutaneous air leak. She presented for elective fistula takedown but experienced complications in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), including diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) last night and is showing improvement in respiratory status, as indicated by the decreasing Respiratory Settling Base Index (RSBI).
- The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), tracheobronchial malacia, and acute onset of upper airway obstruction while off home CPAP. It is likely that she had acute obstruction of the airway and reactive pulmonary edema.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 109/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 40% FiO2.
- The patient is on midazolam drip, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. She underwent a tracheostomy and was taken to the operating room for the elective takedown of a tracheocutaneous fistula. Post-operative, she developed diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient tolerated spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) last night and is improving with reduced respiratory support.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with unclear etiology, possibly due to upper airway obstruction and reactive pulmonary edema. She is improving with ongoing respiratory support.
2. Fever: The patient had a fever, which has subsided. She has surveillance blood cultures negative, and the skin around her tracheostomy site is improving. All cultures growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She will continue vancomycin for another 8 days and discontinue zosyn. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and mini-balloon culture sensitivities will be followed up.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia has stabilized. She will have a CBC checked every 24 hours, and stool for occult blood will be done. If her hemoglobin level is less than 25, she may require a transfusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, upper airway obstruction.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Upper airway obstruction
   (subglottic stenosis, mild), diffuse tracheobronchomalacia, and likely
   episode of negative pressure pulmonary edema.  Tolerating SBT.  Would
   favor extubation in controlled setting.
   SEPSIS -- likely wound related.  Good response.
   BACTEREMIA -- continue antimicrobials.  Probable related to probing of
   surgical wound at bedside.
   TRACHEOCUTANEOUS FISTULA -- s/p surgical flap.  Slow improvement.
   Evidence for sealing off -- no subcutaneous air.
   FLUIDS -- continue net negative balance.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT --  TF.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and other complications. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube (ETT). They tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for 1.5 hours yesterday and were up in a chair while still intubated.

The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and Percocet (which contains oxycodone and acetaminophen). They received antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), on September 16th and 17th, respectively.

The patient's review of systems is largely unchanged from admission, with no significant findings in constitutional, cardiovascular, nutritional support, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, integumentary (skin), endocrine, heme/lymph, neurologic, psychiatric/sleep, or allergy/immunology systems.

Vital signs as of September 17th at 11:58 AM show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/49 mmHg to 113/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress and is well-nourished and overweight. No abnormalities were noted in the eyes, head/ears/nose/throat, lymphatic system, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory/chest, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal system, skin, or neurologic system.

Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets, as well as normal electrolyte levels and kidney function. Blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction, likely caused by subglottic stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia, and negative pressure pulmonary edema. The patient has tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial and may be considered for extubation in a controlled setting.

Additionally, the patient is suspected to have sepsis, possibly related to a wound infection, and bacteremia. Antimicrobial therapy should be continued. The patient also has a tracheocutaneous fistula, which is slowly improving after surgical intervention.

Fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a net negative balance. Nutritional support is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Other ICU care measures include glycemic control with regular insulin, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, upper airway obstruction.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Upper airway obstruction
   (subglottic stenosis, mild), diffuse tracheobronchomalacia, and likely
   episode of negative pressure pulmonary edema.  Tolerating SBT.  Would
   favor extubation in controlled setting.
   SEPSIS -- likely wound related.  Good response.
   BACTEREMIA -- continue antimicrobials.  Probable related to probing of
   surgical wound at bedside.
   TRACHEOCUTANEOUS FISTULA -- s/p surgical flap.  Slow improvement.
   Evidence for sealing off -- no subcutaneous air.
   FLUIDS -- continue net negative balance.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT --  TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, upper airway obstruction, sepsis, bacteremia, tracheocutaneous fistula, and fluid balance issues. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube. They tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial for 1.5 hours yesterday and were up in a chair while intubated. The patient appears bright and interactive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition requiring immediate medical attention. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status are essential.
2. Upper airway obstruction: The patient has subglottic stenosis and diffuse tracheobronchomalacia, which can contribute to upper airway obstruction. This can lead to further respiratory distress and compromise the patient's ability to breathe properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, likely wound-related. Prompt recognition and treatment of sepsis are crucial to prevent further complications and organ dysfunction.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, possibly due to probing of the surgical wound at the bedside. It is important to continue antimicrobial therapy to treat the infection and prevent its spread.
5. Tracheocutaneous fistula: The patient has a tracheocutaneous fistula that was surgically created. Monitoring for signs of improvement and evidence of sealing off is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. The patient underwent a tracheostomy wean but experienced a persistent tracheocutaneous air leak. She presented for an elective takedown of the fistula and developed diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has tolerated spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) without a cuff leak. Extubation is planned today in the operating room with ENT and IP involvement. The patient should maintain O2 saturation levels above 90% due to her home O2 saturation levels being in the same range on 2-3L. Serial chest X-rays and diuresis of -500ml today if systolic blood pressure (SBP) is stable (with lasix) are recommended.

2. Fever: The patient has been afebrile for 48 hours, and surveillance blood cultures are negative. However, the skin around the tracheostomy site is improving. All cultures growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin should be continued for a total of 10-day course given positive blood cultures and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). If spikes again, broadening with"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck and face
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema and acute respiratory failure
   requiring intubation.  Improved.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction she most likely
   that had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary edema.  Has
   tolerated SBTs.  Desats this morning likely [**2-22**] to increased secretions
   in the setting of the cuff down all night, easily weaned back to Fi02
   40%.  Looks clinically stable to extubated, more concerning is the 24
   hours post-extubation given her previous desaturation event.  Would
   like to use CPAP post-extubation to help keep her airways patent
   overnight.
   - Extubation today, bedside, with ENT and IP.
   -Maintain O2 Sats >90 given patient
s home O2 sats are in this range on
   2-3L.
   -Serial CXR
   -Diurese -1L today if SBP stable (with lasix)
   #Fever: Afebrile for 48 hours, surveillance blood cultures negative,
   skin around trach site improving. All cultures growing MRSA. Vanco day
   [**7-1**]
   -Continue Vanco for total 10 day course given positive blood cultures
   and possible VAP.
   -If spikes again, would broaden with cefepime.
   #Anemia: Now stable.
   -q24h CBC
    -guiac stools
   -transfuse if <25
   # Neck swelling s/p fistula takedown: Pt has improved subcutaneous
   emphysema.
    -f/u ENT recs about CPAP use.
   #Pain: Patient put back on PO meds, tolerating well.
   -Continue home vicodin down NG tube.  Once extubated we can bridge her
   with IV pain meds until she is taking PO.
   # CAD/CHF: Pt with long standing CAD s/p CABG/PCI in [**2133**], EKG
   suggestive of old inferior MI.  No evidence of volume overload on
   admission to the ICU and pt denie any chest pain/jaw pain. Tachycardia
   improved yesterday, BNP 1800.
   -Echo with EF of 60% and ? Hypokinesis of inferior/lateral wall
   - ACE this PM (did not receive yesterday) as long as  if HR>60 and SBP
   >100 after lasix
   - Continue ASA by OGT
   - Hold BB
   # COPD/Pulm: Pt carries a diagnosis of COPD but uses only albuterol prn
   and no prior PFTs in OMR.  She had been using 2-3L home oxygen.  No
   audible wheezes on exam, but diffuse upper airway congestion.
   - Continue Nebs PRN
   # OSA: Once extubated, on home CPAP
    - disucuss CPAP use post-exubation with ENT given possibility of
   opening up trach site.
   # Anxiety/Bipolar disorder: History of anxiety, bipolar.  Exacerbated
   by anxiety over intubation and possibility of permanent trach.
   - While OG in place, continue Quetiapine 25mg TID with 100mg qhs down
   tube
   - continue Zoloft 100mg in am
   - Ativan 0.5mg  TID prn (hold for sedation).
   # FEN: On tube feeds.  Will D/C OG when extubated.  Will keep PO at
   least 24 hours.
   - f/u lytes and replete prn
   -f/u nutrition recs
   # PPx: Pneumoboots (no heparin given HIT history), IV PPI while NPO
   - aggressive bowel regimen , had 1x BM yesterday with PR.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy weaning with persistent tracheocutaneous air leak. She presented for elective takedown of the fistula and experienced diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications to consider.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had an unclear etiology of respiratory failure, possibly due to acute obstruction of the airway and reactive pulmonary edema. She tolerated spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) and was easily weaned back to FiO2 40%. The plan is to extubate the patient today at the bedside with the assistance of ENT and IP. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation (SpO2) >90% will be maintained, and serial chest X-rays will be done.

2. Fever: The patient had a fever, which has now subsided. She had positive blood cultures growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin will be continued for a total of 10 days due to positive blood cultures and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). If the fever spikes again, broadening with cefepime will be considered.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is now stable."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with several medical complications. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube (ETT). They tolerated spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for most of the day but experienced a SaO2 desaturation, requiring an increased FiO2 to 60% with resolution of hypoxemia. The patient also had copious secretions and an ETT cuff deflated earlier in the morning. All of these issues have resolved with suctioning.

2. Tracheocutaneous Fistula: The patient has a tracheocutaneous fistula post-muscle flap surgery. Subcutaneous air resolved, suggesting the tract is sealed.

3. Upper Airway Obstruction: The patient has upper airway obstruction due to subglottic stenosis estimated at 30%. However, there is no cuff leak. This condition may contribute to underlying dyspnea.

4. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient also has tracheobronchomalacia, which is contributing to the underlying dyspnea.

5. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient experienced pulmonary edema acutely but has since resolved. This suggests a history of CHF.

6. Bacteremia: The patient is likely suffering from bacteremia"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure s/p trach wean with
   persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for elective
   takedown of fistula, PACU course complicated by diffuse neck and face
   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema and acute respiratory failure
   requiring intubation.  Improved.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction most likely that
   she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary edema.
   Extubated without problems and has kept O2 sats >90 on 2L NC.  Did well
   on CPAP last night also.
   -Maintain O2 Sats >90 given patient
s home O2 sats are in this range on
   2-3L.
   -CXR much improved, no pulm edema
   -ADAT
   #MRSA Infection: Afebrile for 3 days, surveillance blood cultures
   negative, skin around trach site improving. All cultures growing MRSA.
   Vanco day [**7-31**]
   -Continue Vanco for total [**7-29**] day course.
   -If spikes again, would broaden with cefepime.
   #Anemia: Now stable.
   -q24h CBC
   # Neck swelling s/p fistula takedown: Pt has improved subcutaneous
   emphysema.
    -Patient did well with CPAP.
   #Pain: Patient put back on PO meds, tolerating well.
   -Continue home vicodin.
   # CAD/CHF: Pt with long standing CAD s/p CABG/PCI in [**2133**], EKG
   suggestive of old inferior MI.  No evidence of volume overload on
   admission to the ICU and pt denie any chest pain/jaw pain.
   -Echo with EF of 60% and ? Hypokinesis of inferior/lateral wall
   - Continue ACE
   - Continue ASA
   - Restart home Lasix, KCl, and BB
   # COPD/Pulm: Pt carries a diagnosis of COPD but uses only albuterol prn
   and no prior PFTs in OMR.  She had been using 2-3L home oxygen.
   - Continue Nebs PRN
   # OSA: Extubated, on home CPAP
   # Anxiety/Bipolar disorder: History of anxiety, bipolar.  Exacerbated
   by anxiety over intubation and possibility of permanent trach.
   - continue Quetiapine 25mg TID with 100mg qhs
   - continue Zoloft 100mg in am
   - Ativan 0.5mg  TID prn (hold for sedation).
   # FEN: ADAT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. She underwent a tracheostomy and was weaned off mechanical ventilation but had a persistent tracheocutaneous air leak. The patient presented for an elective takedown of the fistula, but her post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) course was complicated by diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced acute respiratory failure with unclear etiology. Given her history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and tracheobronchial malacia, it is likely that she had acute obstruction of the airway and reactive pulmonary edema.
2. MRSA Infection: The patient had cultures growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and she is being treated with vancomycin for a total of 10 days. If the infection spikes again, cefepime will be added.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is now stable, and she should have serial complete blood counts (CBCs), guaiacol test for occult blood in stools, and transfusion if her hemoglobin level falls below 25.
4. Neck Swelling: The patient had neck swelling after the fistula takedown"

   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema and acute respiratory failure
   requiring intubation.  Improved.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction most likely that
   she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary edema.
   Extubated without problems and has kept O2 sats >90 on 2L NC.  Did well
   on CPAP last night also.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. She underwent an elective takedown of tracheocutaneous fistula but experienced complications such as diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation. 

The patient was extubated without problems and has maintained oxygen saturation levels above 90% on 2 liters of nasal cannula. She also did well on CPAP last night. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off home CPAP suggests that she may have had acute obstruction of the airway and reactive pulmonary edema. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and conducting serial chest X-rays are recommended.

2. MRSA Infection: The patient's surveillance blood cultures were negative, but all cultures growing MRSA. A 10-day course of vancomycin is being continued, and if the infection spikes again, cefepime will be broadened.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia has stabilized. Regular CBC monitoring, guaiac stool testing, and transfusion if hemoglobin levels fall below 25 g/dL are recommended.

4. Neck swelling post-fistula takedown: The patient has improved sub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with respiratory distress and sepsis. He was intubated but is now extubated and remains so. The patient tolerated CPAP without worsening of the tracheocutaneous fistula. He denies dyspnea, chest pain, jaw pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, Percocet, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 158/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 37.5°C. The patient appears well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Upper airway obstruction - stable post-extubation.
2. Respiratory failure - multifactorial, including upper airway obstruction, pulmonary edema, and COPD.
3. COPD - resume usual medications and home O2 at 2 L NP.
4. Tracheocutaneous fistula - looks intact after surgical repair. Tolerated CPAP last PM.
5. Obstructive sleep apnea - continue nocturnal CPAP.
6. Bacteremia - related to neck wound. Continue antimicrobials.
7. Bronchitis - complete course of antimicrobials.

   swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous emphysema and acute respiratory failure
   requiring intubation.  Now extubated, doing well on home Bipap.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Unclear etiology, given her history of
   OSA/tracheobroncial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off
   home CPAP, and complaints of upper airway obstruction most likely that
   she had acute obstruction of airway and reactive pulmonary edema.
   Extubated without problems and has kept O2 sats >90 on 2L NC.  Did well
   on CPAP last night also.
   -Maintain O2 Sats >90 given patient

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy weaning but experienced a persistent tracheocutaneous air leak. She presented for an elective takedown of the fistula and had a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) course complicated by diffuse neck and face swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient is now extubated and doing well on home BiPAP.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/tracheobronchial malacia and acute onset of presentation while off home CPAP. The patient is maintaining O2 sats >90 on 2L NC and did well on CPAP last night.
2. MRSA Infection: The patient has been afebrile for 3 days, and surveillance blood cultures are negative. The skin around the tracheostomy site is improving. All cultures growing MRSA, so vancomycin was given for 8 days and will be discontinued today.
3. Anemia: The patient is now stable, and a repeat complete blood count (CBC) should be done"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She has undergone a hip replacement surgery and developed a tracheocutaneous fistula, for which she was admitted for flap repair. Post-operatively, she experienced emphysema in the subcutaneous tissue, which resolved, but then developed acute respiratory failure likely due to OSA and flash pulmonary edema. She was reintubated eight days ago and extubated two days ago.

The patient's allergies include heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin), furosemide (Lasix), lorazepam (Ativan), metoprolol, and pantoprazole (Protonix). Her other medications include pantoprazole, Zoloft, Lamictal, Seroquel, simvastatin, nystatin, lisinopril, and lasix.

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned acute respiratory failure. The flow sheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/53 to 172/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute,"
