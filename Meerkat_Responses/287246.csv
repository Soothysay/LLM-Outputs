   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated. Pressures slowly improved overnight.
   - Continue to monitor in ICU with possible call-out to cardiology
   service later today if hypotension improves and blood pressures
   stabilize
   - Cover with vanco alone for ?cellulitis until 48 hours negative
   culture data; no evidence for gram negative infections currently
   - Avoid further boluses, as appearing overloaded
   - Follow-up last set of pending cardiac enzymes to rule out MI
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia overnight that spontaneously
   aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at time of
   ventricular tachycardic episode.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Appreciate cardiology input, for now they recommend additional 150 mg
   IV amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to
   400 mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam.
   - Diuresis when able.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Cover with vancomycin for now.
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.
   - Vascular following.
   - Will continue vanco with concern of ?cellulitis surrounding proximal
   ulcer.
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult; may need plastics intervention as well.
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.

   Disposition: ICU with potential call-out to cardiology later today
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who recently underwent axillo-bifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU after experiencing multiple episodes of wide complex tachycardia at a rehabilitation facility, which was initially thought to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but later identified as ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient also presents with hypotension, which could be due to sepsis/vasodilatory, cardiogenic, or medication-related causes. Other issues include hypoxia, congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction, leukocytosis, and a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient's current medications include amiodarone for VT, low-dose beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin. The plan involves monitoring in the ICU with a call-out to cardiology if the patient's blood pressure stabilizes, covering with vancomycin for cellulitis, avoiding further fluid boluses, following up with pending cardiac enzymes, holding ACE inhibitor and alpha-blocker, and attempting diuresis later in the day if the patient's blood pressure stabilizes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: The patient has already experienced multiple episodes of VT, and further interventions may be required to prevent future occurrences.
2. In"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypotension and tachycardia. The patient experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia during the night, but they spontaneously aborted after receiving 150 mg of amiodarone.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal range (81 bpm), but slightly lower blood pressure (88/61 mmHg) compared to previous readings. The respiratory rate is normal (19 breaths per minute), and the oxygen saturation is at 97% with nasal cannula support.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates an ongoing fluid deficit with a total input of 1725 mL and output of 800 mL, resulting in a balance of 925 mL. The blood products transfused were 800 mL, and the urine output was 800 mL as well.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (19.1 K/uL), slightly low platelet count (347 K/uL), and normal hemoglobin level (10.4 g/dL). The creatinine level is within normal range (1.3 mg/dL), while the troponin-T level remains low (0.09). Other lab values such as electrolytes, glucose, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, decubitus ulcer, and supraventricular tachycardia. The assessment and plan indicate"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; rehab rhythm appears to be
   Vtach.
   .
   # Hypotension.  Possible causes include sepsis/vasodilatory (given
   leukocytosis and questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers),
   cardiogenic (ACS or poor forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial
   effusion), most likely med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic
   agents for tachycardia).  Lactate not elevated.
   - Cover with vanco alone for ?cellulitis; no evidence for gram negative
   infections currently.  Will not continue levoflox but if unstable would
   provide more broad GNR coverage.
   - Avoid further boluses, as appearing overloaded.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Consider IV calcium or IV glucagon if continues to have low BPs.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia.  Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance
   is Vtach.  Discussed with cards at arrival to MICU.  Thought to be SVT
   at rehab given automatically generated ECG read.  Now back in sinus
   (vs. Apaced rhythm).  Seems to tolerate rhythm relatively well today as
   well as historically per cards (keeps pulses, asymptomatic).  Reason
   for recurrence of VT unclear - new ischemia, stretch from volume
   overload, further disruption of pacer leads leading to more irritation
   of ventricle.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Discussed with cardiology, will see in tonight.
   - If back in VT, may require further IV amiodarone load.  [**Month (only) 51**] not be
   great candidate for lido or other antiarrhythmics given poor systolic
   function.  Can also try IV beta block.
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   .
   # Hypoxia. On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam.
   - Diuresis when able.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic.
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  At baseline from prior admission.  Infection vs. other
   cause (with lots of monos, likely MDS or other bone marrow process).
   - Cover with vancomycin for now.
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   .
   # PVD with recent revascularization.
   - Vascular following.
   - Will continue vanco with concern of ?cellulitis surrounding proximal
   ulcer.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult; may need plastics intervention as well.
   .
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   .
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.
   .
   # Ppx: HSQ and PPI.
   # FEN: regular low Na
   # Access: PIV x 3
   # Code: full (discussed with family at admit)
   # Disp: ICU overnight, if stable to floor cards vs. med.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent recent axillo-bifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU after experiencing multiple episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which was initially suspected to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) at the rehabilitation facility but later identified as ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient also presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and dyspnea. 

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient was found to have leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.1 K/uL and signs of potential cellulitis around a vascular ulcer. His vital signs showed a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 81 bpm with a range of 70-131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67/51 mmHg to 76/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 1 overnight
   - Continue to monitor in ICU with possible call-out to cardiology
   service later today if blood pressures stabilize
   - Continue vanco for ?cellulitis until 48 hours negative culture data;
   no evidence for gram negative infections currently
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09-0.10 stable
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. No repeat episodes of v tach
   since admission.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Appreciate cardiology input- per cards, additional 150 mg IV
   amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to 400
   mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam. Sating 99-100% RA
   - Diuresis when able.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.

   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent recent axillo-bifemoral grafting. The patient was admitted to the MICU after experiencing wide complex tachycardia and received multiple nodal agents for suspected supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), but the rhythm appeared to be ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient has been experiencing low systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 70s, mostly when sleeping, which responded to a 250cc fluid bolus. There have been no episodes of VT since admission. The patient also has leukocytosis and questionable gangrenous ulcers, leading to concerns of sepsis or vasodilatory hypotension. Cardiogenic causes such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or congestive heart failure (CHF) are less likely, but the patient's elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray suggest possible systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic. 

The patient's hypotension is being closely monitored, and they may require a call-out to the cardiology service later today if blood pressures stabilize. The patient will continue to receive vancomycin for possible cellulitis until 48 hours of negative culture data, as well as continue low-dose beta-blockers for arrhythmia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who recently underwent axillo-bifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU after experiencing wide complex tachycardia, which was initially thought to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), but later identified as ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient's hypotension responded to a fluid bolus and is being closely monitored. He has multiple medical complications including congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic, leukocytosis, PVD with recent revascularization, sacral decubitus, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient is on multiple medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, amiodarone for VT, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis/vasodilatory shock, cardiogenic shock (acute coronary syndrome or poor forward flow from CHF), or medication-related causes. The use of multiple nodal agents and negative inotropic agents for tachycardia may contribute to the hypotension.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of VT, which has recurred despite treatment. The underlying cause of the VT is unclear, and further evaluation is needed. The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and critical limb ischemia. He also has a history of decubitus ulcer and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's baseline respiratory rate is on the higher end of normal, and there are crackles noted on pulmonary examination. These findings raise the possibility of pneumonia, especially considering the patient's critical condition and prolonged stay in the ICU.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has limited mobility due to PVD and critical limb ischemia, which increases the risk of DVT. If left untreated, DVT can lead to PE, a life-threatening condition.
3. Wound Infection: The presence of a decubitus ulcer increases the risk of wound infection. The patient's dry oral mucosa and thick secretions may also suggest dehydration, which could contribute to impaired wound healing and increase the risk of infection.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of SVT, and his vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits. However, the use of heparin for prophylaxis suggests concern for thromboembolic events, which can sometimes be associated with arrhythmias.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's limited"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 1 overnight
   - Continue to monitor in ICU with possible call-out to cardiology
   service later today if blood pressures stabilize
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. No repeat episodes of v tach
   since admission.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Appreciate cardiology input- per cards, additional 150 mg IV
   amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to 400
   mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam. Sating 99-100% RA
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.  ? R chest hematoma however crit
   stable.
   - Vascular following.
   - Lower extremity wound care per vascular
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult; may need plastics intervention as well.
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who recently underwent axillobifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU after experiencing wide complex tachycardia, which was initially treated with multiple nodal agents. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, hypoxia, congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic dysfunction and acute on chronic, leukocytosis, PVD with recent revascularization, and sacral decubitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, vasodilatory shock, cardiogenic shock, or medication-related causes. If left untreated, it can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: This condition increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. If not managed properly, it can progress to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, leading to cardiac arrest.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory support with a nasal cannula suggests that he may have difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation. If not properly managed, it can lead to respiratory failure and subsequent organ damage.
4. Congestive heart failure: The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and pulmonary ed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He was admitted to the ICU with acute decompensated heart failure and sepsis. The patient has a history of supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT), decubitus ulcer, and critical limb ischemia in the right lower extremity. 

24-hour events include low systolic blood pressure in the 70s while sleeping, which improved with intervention. The patient received two boluses of 0.9 NS for hypotension and had his metoprolol held. He lost access overnight and required prn nebs, which caused wheezing, so he was given solumedrol 125 mg IV. The patient also experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia this morning and was given amiodarone.

Allergies include penicillins, with an unknown last dose of antibiotics. The patient is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications.

Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and blood product administration. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100% with respiratory support using an aerosol-cool device.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's lack of responsiveness and inability to assess peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other systems.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He presented to the ICU with hypotension, shortness of breath, dysphagia, and a history of supra ventricular tachycardia. The patient required multiple interventions for his hypotension, including bolus infusions of 0.9 NS and holding metoprolol. He also experienced wheezing and received Solumedrol IV. Additionally, the patient had a sustained ventricular tachycardia, for which amiodarone was given. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and his last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin. The patient is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 139 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/46 to 150/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and has an ABG pending. His peripheral pulses are not assessed, and his neurologic examination is not complete. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin T. Other lab results are within normal ranges. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,590 mL, output of 1,040 mL through the PO site, and a negative balance of 690 mL. The patient has received respiratory support and is being closely monitored in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating ongoing issues with maintaining stable blood pressure. This could lead to inadequate perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Shortness of breath: The patient's respiratory distress and requirement for nebs (nebulized bronchodilators) suggest respiratory compromise. This could be due to underlying lung pathology or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Decubitus ulcer: The presence of a decubitus ulcer at admission indicates potential pressure injuries, which can complicate care and increase the risk of infection.
4. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's critical limb ischemia puts him at risk for further complications such as limb loss or poor wound healing.
5. Supra ventricular tachycardia: The patient's history of SVT and recent episode of sustained VT indicate arrhythmia risks, which may require further cardiac evaluation and management.
6. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and potential use of antibiotics suggest a possible infection, which needs to be closely monitored and treated if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 2 overnight
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia as BPs tolerate.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT this am.
   Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1. Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 1. CCU fellow at
   bedside.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Oral amiodarone dose increased to 400 mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Prednisone 60 mg q day.
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Beta blocker held for hypotension, continue as pressures tolerate,
   hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.  ? R chest hematoma however crit
   stable.
   - Vascular following.
   - Lower extremity wound care per vascular
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult
   - Continue wound care
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who recently underwent axillobifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU after experiencing multiple nodal agents for suspected supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), but rhythm appears to be ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has had several medical complications including hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, hypoxia, congestive heart failure (CHF) with acute on chronic systolic dysfunction, leukocytosis, PVD with recent revascularization, sacral decubitus, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure in the 70s while sleeping, which improved with intervention. He received 250 cc 0.9 NS bolus x 2 for hypotension and metoprolol was held. The possible causes of hypotension include sepsis/vasodilatory, cardiogenic (ACS or poor forward flow from CHF), and medication-related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia). Further monitoring and management are required to prevent recurrent hypotension.

2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient had wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach. He received amiodarone 150"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who recently underwent axillo-bifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU after experiencing multiple nodal agents for suspected supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), but the rhythm appeared to be ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

During the night, the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s while sleeping and improved with intervention. He received 250 cc of 0.9 NS bolus twice for hypotension and the administration of metoprolol was held. The patient lost access overnight and required prn nebs for wheezing, resulting in the administration of solumedrol 125 mg IV. In the morning, he had a sustained VT episode and was given amiodarone.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, and his last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin. He is currently on various infusions and medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following:
- Low blood pressure during sleep
- Hypotension responding to fluid bolus
- Ventricular tachycardia episodes
- Hypoxia requiring nebs and steroids

Physical examination findings include:
- Alert elderly male with no respiratory distress
- PERRL, EOMI, oral mucosa dry with"

   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.

   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT this am.

   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Oral amiodarone dose increased to 400 mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease who recently underwent axillo-bifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU after experiencing multiple nodal agents for suspected supraventricular tachycardia, but the rhythm appeared to be ventricular tachycardia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, hypoxia, congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction, leukocytosis, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: Possible causes include sepsis/vasodilatory, cardiogenic (acute coronary syndrome or poor forward flow from congestive heart failure), and medication-related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has had episodes of wide complex tachycardia, identified as ventricular tachycardia. Recurrence of VT is unclear and may be due to new ischemia, volume overload, or further disruption of pacer leads.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely related to volume overload and history of COPD. Wheezing and dyspnea overnight were treated with steroids and diuretics.
4. Congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction: Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR indicate systolic dysfunction,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT this
   morning. Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1, Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP
   converted to sinus rhythm via patient
s AICD.
   - Mexiletine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 2 overnight
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia as BPs tolerate.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Prednisone 60 mg q day.
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Beta blocker held for hypotension, continue as pressures tolerate,
   - hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.
   - Vascular following.
   - Lower extremity wound care per vascular
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult
   - Continue wound care
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT [**3-9**] am.
   Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1, Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP converted to
   sinus rhythm via patient
s AICD.  Repeat episode this am ([**3-10**]) which
   converted c/ amiodarone 150 mg IV.
   - Mexiletine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Per cards not a candidate for lead replacement, will continue medical
   management.
   - TTE [**3-9**] showed slightly inc EF (25-30%), slightly decreased left
   ventricular cavity size and slightly worse mitral regurg.
   - Will discuss with cardiology for potential transfer to cardiology
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated. Vancomycin d/c
d after 48 hours with continued
   negative culture data; Afebrile.
   - Pressures stable overnight.
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia as BPs tolerate.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Steroids and nebs d/c
   - Continue diuresis
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent recent axillofemoral grafting. He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to wide complex tachycardia and is now experiencing multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia. The patient's condition is complicated by congestive heart failure (CHF), systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic, as well as hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which could potentially lead to cardiac arrest if not properly managed.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray indicate acute decompensated heart failure. This condition can progress to severe heart failure, leading to further respiratory distress and organ dysfunction.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recent wheezing and dyspnea suggest the possibility of respiratory exacerbation. If not managed appropriately, this could result in severe respiratory compromise.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count raises concerns for an underlying infection or hemat"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT [**3-9**] am.
   Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1, Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP converted to
   sinus rhythm via patient
s AICD.  No repeat episodes since that time.
   - Mexiletine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Per cards not a candidate for lead replacement, will continue medical
   management.
   - TTE [**3-9**] showed slightly inc EF (25-30%), slightly decreased left
   ventricular cavity size and slightly worse mitral regurg.
   - Will call out to cardiology today as no v tach x 24 hours and BPs
   stable
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated. Vancomycin d/c
d after 48 hours with continued
   negative culture data; Afebrile.
   - Pressures stable overnight.
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia as BPs tolerate.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Steroids and nebs d/c
   - Continue diuresis
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - BB dose increased o/n continue beta blocker as pressures tolerate
   - hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - PO lasix  x  one overnight, 350 cc negative since midnight
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Vancomycin discontinued [**3-9**].
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent recent axillo-bifemoral grafting. The patient has been admitted to the MICU due to wide complex tachycardia and was treated with multiple nodal agents. The rhythm appeared to be ventricular tachycardia, which was successfully terminated with overdrive pacing. The patient also received amiodarone, lidocaine, and mexiletine for the ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, hypoxia, congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic dysfunction, leukocytosis, PVD with recent revascularization, sacral decubitus, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Ventricular tachycardia recurrence: The patient had an episode of ventricular tachycardia that was successfully terminated with overdrive pacing. There is a risk of further episodes occurring.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and gangrenous ulcers, which could indicate an infection. This may lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Cardiogenic shock"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with chronic systolic heart failure who was admitted for recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT). He received 150mg of amiodarone IV this morning. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, which is currently stable. He has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. The patient and his son do not want to receive shocks and have chosen a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
