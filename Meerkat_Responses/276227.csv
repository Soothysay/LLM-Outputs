   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with
   refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome transfered to MICU for
   multifactorial and unexplained Hct drop and fever, likely secondary to
   trauma from recent paracentesis.
   .
   1.  Anemia.  Patient noted to have falling Hct since [**12-23**] after
   getting a therapeutic paracentis in LLQ on that day.  CT abd/pelvis
   shows blood in ascitic fluid and LLQ abomdinal wall hematoma in patient
   with significant hepatic coagulopathy and worsening abdominal
   tenderness and distension over the past 24 hours.  She has not bumped
   appropriately with 3 units of PRBCs. Patient noted to have rising T.
   bili and low haptoglobin, though normal AST, ALT and LDH which argue
   against hemolysis (secondary to ?zosyn, macrobid).  Concern for DIC
   given new fever, though rare shistocytes seen on peripheral smear and
   low fibrinogen of unclear significance in patient with liver failure.
   EGD on [**7-17**] showed portal gastropathy but no history of significant GI
   bleed in recent days.  Noted to have ecchymosis covering her body.
   Suspect that patient has hemoperitoneum secondary to paracentesis due
   to hepatic coagulopathy.
   - transfuse cryo to keep fibrinogen > 80
   - transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct > 30
   - FFP x 2 to keep INR > 2
   - Vitamin K PO 10 x 1
   - keep platelets > 50
   - q 6 hour Hcts, coags, platelets, DIC labs
   - gauic stool
   - apreciate heme recs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] in case of element of GI bleed
   - consider repeat CT abd/pelvis if Hct does not respond to blood
   transfusions
   .
   2.  Fever.  Patient noted to have new fever to 101.4 in setting of
   being on Zosyn for UTI after being afebrile for > 1 week.  Given
   concern that zosyn was causing hemolysis, this was stopped and patient
   was switched to levaquin.  CXR could not rule out PNA though no
   symptoms of pneumonia.  Para negative for SBP on [**2185-12-23**].   Will avoid
   repeat tap at present given trauma secondary to previous para.  Blood
   cultures NGTD at present.  Patient noted to have numerous skin
   breakdowns/ecchymosis.  PICC in place without evidence of infection.
   Of note, WBC has been rising for two days.  Of note, patient has a
   history of resistant infection; VRE bacteremia on [**11-16**] treated with
   dapto completed [**2185-12-2**]; ESBL E. coli UTI on [**12-10**] treated with 3 days
   of bactrim.
   - switch to meropenem for UTI therapy and monitor patient given history
   of allergy (rash) to ertapenem (discussed with ID fellow)
   - Follow fever, wbc
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  WBC has been rising for two days.  Known UTI on
   appropriate antibiotics for two days.  However, prior ESBL E. coli from
   two weeks ago was treated with only three days of bactrim.  CXR cannot
   rule out PNA, though low clinical suspician.  Hold off on repeat para
   due to concern for prior trauma.
   - f/u ua and culture
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   4. Tachypnea.  Fount to be tachypneic in setting of significant
   abdominal ascites and after receiving 3 units of blood today.  Have
   been holding lasix throughout hospital stay.  However, satting 98% on
   RA.
   - lasix prn sob
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  HR had been in 70s-80s until [**12-23**] when Hct began to
   fall.  HR has been steadily rising sicne [**12-23**], now 100-130.  Likely
   secondary to anemia and abomdinal pain.
   - check EKG
   - transfuse blood
   .
   6.  Cirrhosis/ ESLD.  Patient is s/p TIPS [**10-17**] admitted initially for
   refractory ascites.  She underwent therapeutic tap 2 days ago ([**12-23**])
   which showed no evidence of SBP. Awaiting liver transplant, although
   need workup for newly diagnosed thyroid malignancy prior to trasplant.
   - continue lactulose
   - continue rifaxamin
   - lasix 40iv prn volume overload in setting of significant blood
   product transfusions
   .
   7.  Confusion.  Patient noted to be more confused over the past few
   days.  Triggered on [**12-23**] for confusion so lactulose was increased.  No
   evidence of asterixis at present.  Likely multifactorial etiology of
   confusion secondary to abdominal pain, anemia, fever, ?infection, and
   hepatic failure/encephalopathy.
   - follow fever/wbc
   - continue lactulose
   - continue antibiotics
   .
   8. ARF.  Patient has been treated for HRS for >2 weeks.  Urine sodium
   on [**12-10**] noted to be less than 2.  Has UTI at present, being treated
   with Levaquin.
   - U/A, urine lytes
   - monitor I/O
   - octreotide 100 mg SC TID
   - midodrine 7.5 mg TID
   - albumin 25g [**Hospital1 7**]
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   9. Papillary Thyroid Cancer. ***Patient currently UNAWARE of this
   diagnosis.**** While undergoing workup for hypercalcemia, patient found
   to have thryoid nodule.  Biopsy postiive for papillary carcinoma.
   Awaiting evaluation from surgery to determine if surgical resection is
   curable.  Liver transplant on hold pending malignancy workup/treatment.
   - surgery recs
   - liver team to inform patient of malignancy
   .
   10.  Hypercalcemia. Patient being followed by renal and endocrine for
   primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Had low 24 hour urine
   calcium.
   - continue to monitor calcium
   .
   11. Psoriasis.  Evaluated by dermatology who feels skin findings are
   consistent with patient's known history of psoraisis.  However, drug
   reaction remains in differential which could support zosyn-induced
   hemolysis diagnosis.
   -Continue clobetasol, hydrocortisone
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis and refractory ascites, admitted to the ICU for unexplained Hct drop and fever. She underwent therapeutic paracentesis, which resulted in a hematoma at the puncture site. The patient has a history of resistant infections, including VRE bacteremia and ESBL E. coli UTI. She is currently being treated with meropenem for fever and suspected UTI. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing tachypnea, tachycardia, and confusion. She has a history of papillary thyroid cancer and is awaiting evaluation for potential surgical resection. The patient's liver function is impaired, and she is being monitored closely for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatomegaly. She is also being evaluated for potential thyroid malignancy prior to liver transplant.

Potential medical complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels have been falling since December 23rd, indicating a decrease in red blood cell count. This could be due to blood loss during the paracentesis or ongoing bleeding from the hematoma. The patient has been transfused with PRBCs and cryo to maintain an adequate Hct level.
2. Fever: The patient has had recurrent fevers, despite being on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI). There is concern for an underlying infection, such as pneumonia or spontaneous bacterial per"

   hematoma. Relative high-density fluid layering dependently within the
   pelvis
   is present, suggestive of layering blood products
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with
   refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome transfered to MICU for
   unexplained Hct drop, likely secondary to trauma from recent
   paracentesis.
   .
   1.  Anemia.  Patient noted to have falling Hct since [**12-23**] after
   getting a therapeutic paracentis in LLQ on that day.  CT abd/pelvis
   shows blood in ascitic fluid and LLQ abomdinal wall hematoma in patient
   with significant hepatic coagulopathy and worsening abdominal
   tenderness and distension over the past 24 hours.  She has not bumped
   appropriately with 3 units of PRBCs. Patient noted to have rising T.
   bili and low haptoglobin, though normal AST, ALT and LDH which argue
   against hemolysis (secondary to ?zosyn, macrobid). Low haptoglobin may
   be due to hepatic impairment.  Concern for DIC given new fever, though
   rare shistocytes seen on peripheral smear and low fibrinogen of unclear
   significance in patient with liver failure.  EGD on [**7-17**] showed portal
   gastropathy but no history of significant GI bleed in recent days.
   Noted to have ecchymosis covering her body.  Suspect that patient has
   hemoperitoneum secondary to paracentesis due to hepatic coagulopathy.
   - transfuse cryo to keep fibrinogen > 80
   - transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct > 25
   - FFP x 2 to keep INR < 2
   - keep platelets > 50
   - q 6 hour Hcts, coags, platelets, DIC labs
   - gauic stool
   - apreciate heme recs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] in case of element of GI bleed
   - consider repeat CT abd/pelvis if Hct does not respond to blood
   transfusions
   - consider surgery consult if unable to stabilize bleed with reversal
   of coagulapathy and blood product supports
   .
   2.  Fever.  Patient noted to have new fever to 101.4 on [**12-25**] in
   setting of being on Zosyn for UTI after being afebrile for > 1 week.
   Given concern that zosyn was causing hemolysis, this was stopped and
   patient was switched to levaquin.  CXR could not rule out PNA though no
   symptoms of pneumonia.  Para negative for SBP on [**2185-12-23**].   Will avoid
   repeat tap at present given trauma secondary to previous para.  Blood
   cultures NGTD at present.  Patient noted to have numerous skin
   breakdowns/ecchymosis.  PICC in place without evidence of infection.
   Of note, WBC has been rising for two days.  Of note, patient has a
   history of resistant infection; VRE bacteremia on [**11-16**] treated with
   dapto completed [**2185-12-2**]; ESBL E. coli UTI on [**12-10**] treated with 3 days
   of bactrim.
   - switch to meropenem for UTI therapy and monitor patient given history
   of allergy (rash) to ertapenem (discussed with ID fellow)
   - Follow fever, wbc
   - consider empiric linezolid given VRE history if patient decompensates
   to cover line infection
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  WBC has been rising for two days.  Known UTI on
   appropriate antibiotics for two days.  However, prior ESBL E. coli from
   two weeks ago was treated with only three days of bactrim.  CXR cannot
   rule out PNA, though low clinical suspician.  Hold off on repeat para
   due to concern for prior trauma.
   - f/u ua and culture
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   4. Tachypnea.  Fount to be tachypneic in setting of significant
   abdominal ascites and after receiving 3 units of blood today.  Have
   been holding lasix throughout hospital stay.  However, satting 98% on
   RA.   Woresening CHF on CXR today, though appears comfortable and on
   room air.
   - lasix prn sob

   5.  Tachycardia.  HR had been in 70s-80s until [**12-23**] when Hct began to
   fall.  HR has been steadily rising sicne [**12-23**], now 100-130.  Likely
   secondary to anemia and abomdinal pain.
   - check EKG
   - transfuse blood
   .
   6.  Cirrhosis/ ESLD.  Patient is s/p TIPS [**10-17**] admitted initially for
   refractory ascites.  She underwent therapeutic tap 2 days ago ([**12-23**])
   which showed no evidence of SBP. Awaiting liver transplant, although
   need workup for newly diagnosed thyroid malignancy prior to trasplant.
   - continue lactulose
   - discuss with liver why not on rifaxamin
   - lasix 40iv prn volume overload in setting of significant blood
   product transfusions
   .
   7.  Confusion.  Patient noted to be more confused over the past few
   days.  Triggered on [**12-23**] for confusion so lactulose was increased.  No
   evidence of asterixis at present.  Likely multifactorial etiology of
   confusion secondary to abdominal pain, anemia, fever, ?infection, and
   hepatic failure/encephalopathy.
   - follow fever/wbc
   - continue lactulose
   - continue antibiotics
   .
   8. ARF.  Patient has been treated for HRS for >2 weeks.  Urine sodium
   on [**12-10**] noted to be less than 2.  Has UTI at present, being treated
   with Levaquin.
   - U/A, urine lytes
   - monitor I/O
   - octreotide 100 mg SC TID
   - midodrine 7.5 mg TID
   - discuss with liver if albumin 25g [**Hospital1 7**] can be stopped due to
   significant blood product transfusions
   - appreciate renal recs

   9. Papillary Thyroid Cancer. ***Patient currently UNAWARE of this
   diagnosis.**** While undergoing workup for hypercalcemia, patient found
   to have thryoid nodule.  Biopsy postiive for papillary carcinoma.
   Awaiting evaluation from surgery to determine if surgical resection is
   curable.  Liver transplant on hold pending malignancy workup/treatment.

   primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Had low 24 hour urine
   calcium.
   - continue to monitor calcium
   .
   11. Psoriasis.  Evaluated by dermatology who feels skin findings are
   consistent with patient's known history of psoraisis.  However, drug
   reaction remains in differential which could support zosyn-induced
   hemolysis diagnosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Anemia: The patient's Hct (hematocrit) has been falling since December 23rd after undergoing a therapeutic paracentesis. The CT abdomen/pelvis shows blood in the ascitic fluid and an abdominal wall hematoma. The patient has received blood transfusions but has not responded adequately. There is a concern for hemoperitoneum secondary to paracentesis due to hepatic coagulopathy.

2. Fever: The patient has a new fever of 101.4 on December 25th. This could be due to an infection, especially since the patient is on antibiotics for a UTI. The CXR (chest X-ray) could not rule out pneumonia, and blood cultures are pending. The patient has a history of resistant infections, including VRE bacteremia and an ESBL E. coli UTI.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC (white blood cell count) has been rising for two days. This could be a sign of an ongoing infection, especially considering the patient's history of UTIs and the current antibiotic therapy.

4. Tachypnea: The patient is experiencing rapid breathing, which may be related to significant abdominal ascites and recent blood transfusions. Lasix has been withheld due to the risk of volume depletion.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with recurrent ascites and
   recent HRS who was admitted to MICU with a drop in HCT which is at
   least in part due to a recent paracentesis [**12-23**] with  intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage and failure to respond to transfusions on the floor.
   Hypotension / Hct Drop: at least in part explained by intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage in the setting of elevated INR and paracentesis attempt. She
   has received in total 4UPRBC and 1 UFFP since [**12-23**]. There may also be
   an element of hemolysis with increasing bilirubin and low haptogloibin
   but normal LDH  Notably she has no varices on EGD in [**8-/2185**] and no
   evidence of bleeding from above or below (grossly) but she is heme
   positive in stool  .  We will work to actively reverse her INR to
   prevent further bleeding. Perhaps there is an element of hemolysis (?
   Relation to Pip-tazo) and we have changed Abx.  DIC seems less likely
   based on low D-dimer, her fibrinogen is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of her liver disease.
   - Hct > 25, INR < 2.0 (if possible), PLt>50
   -Vit K
   - Follow DIC labs
   Fever: has a Klebsiella UTI (from [**12-23**]), notably she has had a ESBL
   Kleb in the past.  Notably the paracentesis on [**12-23**] was neg for
   infection (by WBC and clx).  She also has a PICC line but clx have
   remained neg. Will cont meropenem for now (despite ertapenem allergy,
   ok per ID). We will defer additional paracentesis, but if she spikes a
   fever we may need to re-consider. Antibiotics choices are complicated
   in this patient given her multiple allergies.
   - Cont Meropenem. If spikes wll need to add gram pos coverage (has a hx
   of VRE)
   - Follow up blood clx and urine clx.
   Ascites/Liver failure underlying Hep C/MTX with progressive liver
   failure. We will cont the
   - cont lactulose. Will ask liver service why she is not on rifax.
   - defer lasix given hemodynamic instability
   Renal failure: her new chronic base line appears to be near 2.8 with a
   known recent hx of HRS (s/p treatment with midodrine)
   - cont octreotide and midodrine with high dose albumin. We may be able
   to defer the albumin in the setting of her transfusions.
   Eosinophilia: unclear etiology it has been present since the end of
   [**Month (only) 1148**]. It does not appear to be related to medication although this
   would be the concern in the setting of her fevers (no rash). The
   broader differential includes papillary thyroid cancer .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of HCV/MTX cirrhosis, recurrent ascites, and recent hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She was admitted to the MICU due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) following a recent paracentesis with intra-abdominal hemorrhage and failure to respond to transfusions on the floor. The patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) since December 23rd. There is evidence of hemolysis with increasing bilirubin levels and low haptoglobin, but normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). She is heme positive in stool, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding despite no evidence of varices on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and no gross bleeding from above or below. The patient has a history of Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and previous extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella infection. Her blood cultures remained negative. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple drug allergies, making antibiotic choices challenging. She is currently on meropenem, and additional gram-positive coverage may be needed if she spikes a fever.

   Assessment and Plan
   59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with recurrent ascites and
   recent HRS who was admitted to MICU with a drop in HCT which is at
   least in part due to a recent paracentesis [**12-23**] with  intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage and failure to respond to transfusions on the floor.
   Hypotension / Hct Drop: at least in part explained by intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage in the setting of elevated INR and paracentesis attempt. She
   has received in total 4UPRBC and 1 UFFP since [**12-23**]. There may also be
   an element of hemolysis with increasing bilirubin and low haptogloibin
   but normal LDH  Notably she has no varices on EGD in [**8-/2185**] and no
   evidence of bleeding from above or below (grossly) but she is heme
   positive in stool  .  We will work to actively reverse her INR to
   prevent further bleeding. Perhaps there is an element of hemolysis (?
   Relation to Pip-tazo) and we have changed Abx.  DIC seems less likely
   based on low D-dimer, her fibrinogen is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of her liver disease.
   - Hct > 25, INR < 2.0 (if possible), PLt>50
   -Vit K
   - Follow DIC labs
   Fever: has a Klebsiella UTI (from [**12-23**]), notably she has had a ESBL
   Kleb in the past.  Notably the paracentesis on [**12-23**] was neg for
   infection (by WBC and clx).  She also has a PICC line but clx have
   remained neg. Will cont meropenem for now (despite ertapenem allergy,
   ok per ID). We will defer additional paracentesis, but if she spikes a
   fever we may need to re-consider. Antibiotics choices are complicated
   in this patient given her multiple allergies.
   - Cont Meropenem. If spikes wll need to add gram pos coverage (has a hx
   of VRE)
   - Follow up blood clx and urine clx.
   Ascites/Liver failure underlying Hep C/MTX with progressive liver
   failure. We will cont the
   - cont lactulose. Will ask liver service why she is not on rifax.
   - defer lasix given hemodynamic instability
   Renal failure: her new chronic base line appears to be near 2.8 with a
   known recent hx of HRS (s/p treatment with midodrine)
   - cont octreotide and midodrine with high dose albumin. We may be able
   to defer the albumin in the setting of her transfusions.
   Eosinophilia: unclear etiology it has been present since the end of
   [**Month (only) 1148**]. It does not appear to be related to medication although this
   would be the concern in the setting of her fevers (no rash). The
   broader differential includes papillary thyroid cancer .
   Papillary carcinoma: deferring additional work up at this point, she
   may be a surgical candidate.

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis and recurrent ascites who was admitted to the MICU with a drop in HCT due to a recent paracentesis and intra-abdominal hemorrhage. She received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) since her admission on 12/23. The patient has elevated INR, low haptoglobin, and increasing bilirubin levels, suggesting hemolysis. There is no evidence of bleeding from varices or other sources, but she is heme positive in her stool. The plan is to actively reverse her INR to prevent further bleeding and consider hemolysis as a potential cause. DIC seems less likely based on low D-dimer levels and the patient's liver disease.

Other issues include a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and an Eosinophilia of unclear etiology. The patient's renal function is compromised with a baseline creatinine level of 2.8, and she has a history of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Treatment for HRS includes octreotide and midodrine with high-dose albumin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's liver failure, she is at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and"
