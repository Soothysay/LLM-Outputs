   24 Hour Events:
   Pt continued to be dypsneic over yesterday since transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]. At
   4pm, switched to 6L NC to maintain sat above 92%.  Increasingly
   tachypneic overnight (RR 20-30s -> 40s.) Last night had episode of
   acute dyspnea. CTA obtained, which ruled out PE. Did show possible
   worsening of underlying pulmonary process.
   Multiple fever spikes throughout the day and now this a.m. Does not
   always respond to Tylenol.
   Has also had multiple episodes of incontinence, currently using condom
   cath.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: the patient became tachypneic on a.m. of admission, but
   maintained his sats well. His repeat ABG showed a primary respiratory
   alkalosis with a slight increase in his A-a gradient. The patient felt
   that he was becoming very anxious and given that he responded to ativan
   very well and his CXR is unchanged from prior, his decrease in PO2 may
   very well have been from hyperventilation and increased dead space
   ventilation. CTA ruled out PE, but does support an atypical infectious
   process in his lungs. Pt continues to be tachypneic, despite
   anti-anxiety medication and reassurance, currently requiring 6LNC.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - Continue Doxycyclin (Day #2) per ID recs (concern for atypical
   infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin
   - Do not restart PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxia: evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   atypical infection. ID recommends restarting doxycyclin.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin, Doxycyclin
   .
   # Pancytopenia: bone marrow biopsy is concerning for AML M6 type. His
   very extensive infectious disease workup has so far been negative,
   including a negative PCR for ParvoB19. He appears to be hemolyzing
   given elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, although this is likely
   compounded by myelodysplasia.
   - further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Will talk with BMT regarding the risks/benefits of holding chemo
   while evaluating pulmonary process, as fever/symptoms may be secondary
   to the leukemia itself vs. pulmonary infection.
   - Will touch base with BMT regarding transfusion thresholds
   (?hematocrit>25, plts>20). Current hct =  21.7, plt = 13.
   - f/u ID recs, restarted doxycycline as above
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Tmax of 103.6 over yesterday.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days.
   -          Consider U/S RUQ to eval for infiltrative process, given
   pt
s dx of leukemia.
   -          Will touch base with BMT.
   .
   # HIV: Continue HAART therapy.
   - stable on atripla treatment
   .
   # HTN: HR elevated over most of yesterday (range 100-130s), BP in
   90s-110s. Pt also has had decreased urine output.
   -          Will try a fluid challenge to see if  UOP and HR will
   respond favorably.
   -          For now, will continue home Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **]. Will consider
   increasing if HR still not effectively controlled after fluid
   challenge.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cont zetia
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, replete as necessary
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. Will add H2 blocker today.

   # Dispo: Continue ICU monitoring as HR and respiratory status still
   unstable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV and currently on the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process. The patient has been transferred to the ICU due to dyspnea and hypoxia. 

The patient's 24-hour events include being dypsneic since transfer to the ICU, requiring increased oxygen to maintain saturation above 92%. The patient's respiratory rate has been increasing, reaching 40s overnight. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, ruling out pulmonary embolism (PE) but showing possible worsening of an underlying pulmonary process. The patient experienced multiple fever spikes throughout the day, which did not always respond to Tylenol. Additionally, the patient had episodes of incontinence and is currently using a condom catheter.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were cefepime at 10:00 PM on [date] and caspofungin at 12:03 AM on [date].

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.6°F, heart rate ranging from 110 to 149 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 71 to 103/57 to 61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 6 liters of nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: the patient became tachypneic on a.m. of admission, but
   maintained his sats well. His repeat ABG showed a primary respiratory
   alkalosis with a slight increase in his A-a gradient. The patient felt
   that he was becoming very anxious and given that he responded to ativan
   very well and his CXR is unchanged from prior, his decrease in PO2 may
   very well have been from hyperventilation and increased dead space
   ventilation. CTA ruled out PE, but does support an atypical infectious
   process in his lungs. Pt continues to be tachypneic, despite
   anti-anxiety medication and reassurance, currently requiring 6LNC.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - Continue Doxycyclin per ID recs (concern for atypical infection like
   pulmonary tularemia)
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin
   - Do not restart PCP treatment
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 3905**] anxiolytics
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxia: evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   atypical infection. ID recommends restarting doxycyclin.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin, Doxycyclin
   .
   # Pancytopenia: bone marrow biopsy is concerning for AML M6 type. His
   very extensive infectious disease workup has so far been negative,
   including a negative PCR for ParvoB19. He appears to be hemolyzing
   given elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, although this is likely
   compounded by myelodysplasia.
   - further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - may need chemo defer to BMT
   - will transfuse to keep hematocrit>25, plts>20
   - f/u ID recs, restarted doxycycline as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV and currently on the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, was transferred to the ICU due to tachypnea. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea and hypoxia since the transfer. On admission, he required supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation above 92%. His respiratory rate increased overnight (RR 20-30s -> 40s). The patient also had multiple fever spikes in the afternoon and episodes of incontinence.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He received his last dose of antibiotics (cefepime) on 08/31/2010 at 10:00 PM and caspofungin on 09/01/2010 at 12:03 AM. He is currently receiving multiple ICU medications and other medications.

There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.6°F at 5:00 PM, blood pressure ranging from 103/61 mmHg to 147/89 mmHg, heart rate between 110-149 bpm, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's current temperature is 37.6°C, and his blood pressure is within normal limits. His heart"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Oxygenation deteriorated slightly overnight with increased supplemental
   oxygen via nasal cannula, and then had more sudden change in
   respiratory rate in absence of reported anxiety. CTA obtained for
   tachypnea; it was negative for pulmonary embolism. Temp up to 103.6

   Variable respiratory rates and oxygenation through the past 24 hours.
   During my exam, I reduced his supplemental O2 to 3L via nasal cannula.
   O2 sats holding at 95-96%. With coaching, respiratory rate a bit
   slower, although he remains tachypneic. Probably represents some
   anxiety and some stimulation of pulmonary receptors from underlying
   pneumonia, which dose appear to have progressed slightly on CT scan. No
   evidence of pulmonary embolism. Cultures remain negative thus far.
   Fevers persist.
   Hct near transfusion threshold. Given variable oxygenation, I would
   favor transfusion for increased oxygen carrying capacity.
   Start H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis and pneumoboots for DVT
   prophylaxis.
   Patient appears somewhat volume depleted. Give additional IV fluids via
   boluses.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and pancytopenia. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with increased supplemental oxygen requirement and a sudden change in respiratory rate. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed, ruling out pulmonary embolism. The patient's temperature has been elevated, reaching 103.6°F yesterday. The patient is experiencing tachypnea and has a low oxygen saturation level.

Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, normal blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient appears well-nourished but anxious. No abnormalities were observed in the eyes, head, ears, nose, or throat. The cardiovascular examination revealed normal findings, while the respiratory examination showed crackles in the chest bilaterally and soft expiratory wheeze. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Extremities show trace edema, and there are no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. The musculoskeletal examination is normal, and the skin is warm without rash or jaundice. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, and has purposeful movements.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: pt continues to be tachypneic. Likely related to his
   underlying malignancy vs. pulmonary infiltrative process. Requiring
   increased O2 daily. Pt expressed desire to be intubated if necessary.
   - continue supplemental O2. [**Month (only) 60**] intubate later today if work of
   breathing continues to increase.
   - Continue high-dose Doxycyclin (Day #3) per ID recs (concern for
   atypical infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Per ID recs, will d/c Cefepime and start Meropenem (Day #5) for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - Will add Vanc per ID recs to cover gram +
   - Will change Caspofungin to Microfungin per ID recs to decrease
   effects on LFTs
   - Holding off on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - ID following
   .
   # AML M6 c/b Pancytopenia: likely poor prognosis per BMT. Pt is a poor
   candidate for BMT with his HIV status. Additionally, current chemo
   regimen available to pt is 2^nd line, with significant side effects. In
   family mtg, pt wanted to proceed with chemo.
   - Pending further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Pt started a dose of chemo with Cytarabine last night. Will touch
   base with BMT regarding additional dosing.
   - BMT following
   - Given mental status change and encephalopathy, will consider adding
   Lactulose (?non- PO form available).
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: pt continues to be afebrile with spikes to 103.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days. LDH
   spiked to [**Numeric Identifier 3932**] this a.m. Can be related to recent initiation of chemo
   last night.
   -          RUQ u/s obtained yesterday to eval for obstructive process
   given leukemia. Results negative for masses/ infiltrative process.
   -          BMT following. Will touch base regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   -          Will check q6 tumor lysis labs.
   .
   # HIV: Stable on HAART therapy.
   - Continue Atripla. Will touch base with ID regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   .
   # BP control: currently stable. Continue home lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].
   # Hyperlipidemia: Zetia d/c
ed given elevated LFTs.
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, but pt not taking much PO. Consider NGT for
   feeding (?mucositis given leukemia? Will check with BMT.) replete lytes
   as necessary.
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. H2 blocker IV.
   .
   # Lines: PIV, RSC CVL
   .
   # Dispo: Continue ICU monitoring as HR and respiratory status still
   unstable.
   .
   # Code: Full. Family meeting today to discuss possible plan for
   intubation today with patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV and possible acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M6. He is currently admitted to the ICU for tachypnea and has been diagnosed with febrile neutropenia. The patient has expressed his desire to be intubated if necessary. His vital signs include a temperature of 103.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 129 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/79 mmHg, respiratory rate in the 40s, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's mental status is unclear, possibly encephalopathic. He is receiving supplemental oxygen and is expected to undergo intubation later today if his work of breathing continues to increase. The patient is also receiving high-dose doxycycline, meropenem, vancomycin, and microfungin per ID recommendations. His blood work shows elevated levels of LDH, AST, and INR, indicating possible organ dysfunction or damage. The patient's family has been informed about the possible plan for intubation today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation may progress to respiratory failure if not adequately supported with oxygen and possible intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's febrile neutropenia indicates a high risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ failure if not promptly treated.

   alkalosis with a slight increase in his A-a gradient. The patient felt
   that he was becoming very anxious and given that he responded to ativan
   very well and his CXR is unchanged from prior, his decrease in PO2 may
   very well have been from hyperventilation and increased dead space
   ventilation. CTA ruled out PE, but does support an atypical infectious
   process in his lungs. Pt continues to be tachypneic, despite
   anti-anxiety medication and reassurance, currently requiring 6LNC.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - Continue Doxycyclin (Day #2) per ID recs (concern for atypical
   infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin
   - Do not restart PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxia: evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   atypical infection. ID recommends restarting doxycyclin.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin, Doxycyclin
   .
   # Pancytopenia: bone marrow biopsy is concerning for AML M6 type. His
   very extensive infectious disease workup has so far been negative,
   including a negative PCR for ParvoB19. He appears to be hemolyzing
   given elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, although this is likely
   compounded by myelodysplasia.
   - further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Will talk with BMT regarding the risks/benefits of holding chemo
   while evaluating pulmonary process, as fever/symptoms may be secondary
   to the leukemia itself vs. pulmonary infection.
   - Will touch base with BMT regarding transfusion thresholds
   (?hematocrit>25, plts>20). Current hct =  21.7, plt = 13.
   - f/u ID recs, restarted doxycycline as above
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Tmax of 103.6 over yesterday.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days.
   -          Consider U/S RUQ to eval for infiltrative process, given
   pt
s dx of leukemia.
   -          Will touch base with BMT.
   .
   # HIV: Continue HAART therapy.
   - stable on atripla treatment
   .
   # HTN: HR elevated over most of yesterday (range 100-130s), BP in
   90s-110s. Pt also has had decreased urine output.
   -          Will try a fluid challenge to see if  UOP and HR will
   respond favorably.
   -          For now, will continue home Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **]. Will consider
   increasing if HR still not effectively controlled after fluid
   challenge.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is pneumonia, hypoxemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and pancytopenia. The patient has been treated for AML and received blood transfusions for low hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress and requires supplemental oxygen.

The patient's fever was recorded at 103.3°F (39.6°C) and the heart rate is 142 bpm with sinus tachycardia. Blood pressure is 118/57 mmHg, respiratory rate is 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on supplemental oxygen. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

The patient's laboratory results show low white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), and low platelet count (Plt). Liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are elevated, indicating liver involvement. Kidney function tests such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) are within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal fatty infiltration of the liver and increased alveolar nodular opacities on chest X-ray, indicating lung involvement consistent with pneumonia.

The patient's assessment and plan include pneumonia, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, AML, pancytopenia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, dyspnea, and febrile neutropenia. The patient required intubation yesterday afternoon and has been on invasive ventilation since 3:00 PM. An arterial line was placed at 10:00 PM. The patient has a fever of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit. There have been multiple transfusions of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. The patient's renal function and respiratory function are worsening, as indicated by the ABG results. The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, with a lowest reading of 80s/40. Pressors were held off due to this. The patient's heart rate is elevated at 120 bpm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) due to worsening respiratory function and low oxygen saturation levels.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure due to the rising levels of uric acid and worsening renal function.
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to febrile neutropenia, fever, and hypotension.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization and risk factors.
6. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of corticosteroids and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: pt continues to be tachypneic. Likely related to his
   underlying malignancy vs. pulmonary infiltrative process. Requiring
   increased O2 daily. Pt expressed desire to be intubated if necessary.
   - continue supplemental O2. [**Month (only) 60**] intubate later today if work of
   breathing continues to increase.
   - Continue high-dose Doxycyclin (Day #3) per ID recs (concern for
   atypical infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Per ID recs, will d/c Cefepime and start Meropenem (Day #5) for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - Will add Vanc per ID recs to cover gram +
   - Will change Caspofungin to Microfungin per ID recs to decrease
   effects on LFTs
   - Holding off on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - ID following
   .
   # AML M6 c/b Pancytopenia: likely poor prognosis per BMT. Pt is a poor
   candidate for BMT with his HIV status. Additionally, current chemo
   regimen available to pt is 2^nd line, with significant side effects. In
   family mtg, pt wanted to proceed with chemo.
   - Pending further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Pt started a dose of chemo with Cytarabine last night. Will touch
   base with BMT regarding additional dosing.
   - BMT following
   - Given mental status change and encephalopathy, will consider adding
   Lactulose (?non- PO form available).
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: pt continues to be afebrile with spikes to 103.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days. LDH
   spiked to [**Numeric Identifier 3932**] this a.m. Can be related to recent initiation of chemo
   last night.
   -          RUQ u/s obtained yesterday to eval for obstructive process
   given leukemia. Results negative for masses/ infiltrative process.
   -          BMT following. Will touch base regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   -          Will check q6 tumor lysis labs.
   .
   # HIV: Stable on HAART therapy.
   - Continue Atripla. Will touch base with ID regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   .
   # BP control: currently stable. Continue home lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].
   # Hyperlipidemia: Zetia d/c
ed given elevated LFTs.
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, but pt not taking much PO. Consider NGT for
   feeding (?mucositis given leukemia? Will check with BMT.) replete lytes
   as necessary.
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. H2 blocker IV.
   .
   # Lines: PIV, RSC CVL
   .
   # Dispo: Continue ICU monitoring as HR and respiratory status still
   unstable.
   .
   # Code: Full. Family meeting today to discuss possible plan for
   intubation today with patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, currently on the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process. He was transferred to the ICU due to tachypnea and has since been intubated. The patient's condition has been unstable, with hypoxia, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, and worsening renal and respiratory function. He has received multiple blood products and has had his pressors held off. The patient's LFTs are also elevated, and there are concerns about an obstructive process in the liver. The patient is on HAART therapy for HIV, and his code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is worsening, and he requires increased oxygen daily. There is a concern for underlying malignancy or pulmonary infiltrative process contributing to his tachypnea. The patient is already intubated, but he may require further respiratory support.
2. Septic Shock: The patient has febrile neutropenia, which indicates an increased risk for infections. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he has required pressors in the past. There is a possibility of septic shock due to an ongoing infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by rising uric acid levels and oliguria. AKI can occur due to hypotension,"
