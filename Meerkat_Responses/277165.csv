   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of high-grade cardiac lymphoma, now presenting with pneumonia, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, ischemic heart disease, and compromised left ventricular function. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. He is on vaspressor support and has an indwelling PICC line that was removed due to erythema. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6Â°C, heart rate 94 bpm, blood pressure 111/57 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 14 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) of 1,550 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 105 mg/dL, elevated creatinine at 0.8 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals re-expansion of the left lower lobe (LLL) with resolving atelectasis and new infiltrate in the LLL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute respiratory failure: Suspect multifactorial, including LLL pneumonia (HAP), COPD/asthma exacerbation. Plan to continue mechanical ventilation and empirical Vancomycin/Zosyn. Work towards spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and assessment for extubation. Follow-up chest X-ray.
2. Sepsis: Mild hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. Less likely cardiogenic (cardiac lymphoma). Sources include lung and line-related (PICC). Wean Levophed, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
3. LLL atelectasis: Resolved. Monitor.
4. Ischemic heart disease: Likely secondary or demand ischemia, rather than primary event. Check echocardiogram in the morning.
5. Cardiac lymphoma: Recent chemotherapy. Mild compromised left ventricular function.
6. Fluids: Repleting. Monitor intake/output, maintain CVP >10 cm H2O.
7. Left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): s/p inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Monitor.
8. Nutritional support: Tube feeding (TF), hold as may be ready for extubation soon.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
3. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)
5. Ischemic heart disease progression or myocardial infarction"

- He is still on vasopressor support.
- Erythema was noted at the site of an indwelling peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), which was subsequently removed.
- The patient was awake and attempting to communicate this morning.
- His vital signs remain stable, with a heart rate between 94-104 beats per minute, blood pressure between 111/57-139/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure:
- The patient is suspected to have multifactorial respiratory failure, including lung pneumonia and exacerbation of COPD/asthma.
- Plan to continue mechanical ventilation and administer empirical antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn).
- Work towards spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and assess for extubation.
- Follow-up chest X-ray (CXR) is needed.

2. Sepsis:
- The patient has mild hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.
- Less likely to be cardiogenic in origin due to cardiac lymphoma.
- Sources of sepsis include lung infection and line-related (PICC).
- Weaning of Levophed is planned, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Atelectasis:
- The atelectasis has resolved.
- Monitoring is recommended.

4. Ischemic Heart Disease:
- The patient likely has secondary or demand ischemia rather than a primary event.
- Elevated cardiac enzymes may also be related to cardiac involvement of lymphoma.
- Check for an echocardiogram in the morning.

5. Cardiac Lymphoma:
- The patient has a history of recent chemotherapy for cardiac lymphoma.
- Mild compromised left ventricular (LV) function is noted.

6. Fluids:
- Fluid repletion is ongoing.
- Monitor intake/output (I/O) and maintain central venous pressure (CVP) above 10 cm H2O.

7. Left Lower Extremity (LLE) Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):
- The patient has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place.
- Monitor for any complications related to the IVC filter.

8. Nutritional Support:
- Tube feeding (TF) has been held as the patient may be ready for extubation soon.

9. ICU Care:
- Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis"

   #.  Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - In setting of elevated WBC,
   imaging with LLL infiltrate, most likely etiology PNA but must also
   consider given history, COPD exacerbation([**12-30**] FEV1 1.01) or heart
   failure from cardiac tumor. He has no known systolic or diastolic
   dysfunction but known right atrial lymphoma mass. No evidence of PE on
   OSH CTA chest. Must also consider aspiration pneumoia
   - cover for hospital acquired PNA given recent hospitalization,
   continue vanc, start zosyn, will discontinue azithromycin for atypicals
   - send endotracheal sputum sample, check viral respiratory cx,
   legionella UA, f/u blood cx sent from ED
   - albuterol/ipratropium inhalers Q6H, prn high resistance
   - continue with mechanical ventilation, AC 550/12/5, decrease FiO2 as
   tolerated
   - VAP bundle, fentanyl/versed for sedation
   .
   #. Shock - Presumed sepsis from pulmonary source vs. PICC line vs.
   cardiogenic vs. obstructive [**12-23**] right atrial tumor. No evidence of
   right heart failure, exam not consistent with distributive shock.
   - d/c left PICC, sent cath tip for culture, obtain Blood culture off
   line prior to d/c
   - IVF boluses to CVP>12, MAP>65, UOP> 40 cc/hr, then levophed to
   maintain MAP>65
   - trend lactate Q2H
   - continous SvO2 monitor w/ goal >70%
   .
   #. Possible NSTEMI - Initial set of CEs elevated in the ED. Most recent
   troponin from [**2-9**] elevated at 0.33/0.43. No prior BNP in our system.
   Unclear what to make of CE elevation in setting of recent chemotherapy
   targeted and cardiac tumor. EKG at baseline.
   - trend CEs Q8H x2 additional sets
   - monitor on telemetry, obtain ECHO in am as below
   - if rules in, start BB, ASA, STATIN
   .
   #. High-grade Cardiac Lymphoma - S/p 2nd cycle R-[**Hospital1 988**], last discharged
   from BMT [**2-14**], completed neupogen. Plan for next cycle of chemo [**2201-2-27**]
   and ECHO to assess response on [**2-24**]
   - obtain planned TTE to assess EF and tumor response in am
   - continue prn antiemetics, allopurinol
   - will make BMT team aware of admission in am
   .
   #. DVT - s/p filter placement, decision made during last admission
   patient at too high risk for anticoagulation. No evidence of PE on CTA
   Chest at OSH.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of high-grade cardiac lymphoma, who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and sepsis. The patient's medical history includes a recent hospitalization, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with filter placement, and chemotherapy treatment. The patient's current conditions include acute hypoxic respiratory failure, shock (presumed sepsis), possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and high-grade cardiac lymphoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and imaging with left lower lobe infiltrate, which suggests a possible pneumonia. This can be confirmed by sending an endotracheal sputum sample and checking for viral respiratory infections, Legionella urinary antigen, and other relevant tests.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should follow the VAP bundle protocol, including regular weaning trials and appropriate antibiotic coverage.
3. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and the source of infection appears to be pulmonary. Continuous monitoring of lactate levels and maintaining adequate tissue perfusion are important to manage sepsis.
4. Right atrial mass: The patient has a known right atrial lymphoma mass, which could potentially cause obstruction or compress nearby structures. Close"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. A right atrial mass is suggested but
   not well defined on the basis of this study. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with high-grade cardiac lymphoma who presented with acute respiratory distress and left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) for hospital-acquired pneumonia and is showing improvement in respiratory status. The patient's WBC count is trending downward, and they have remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.

The patient's cardiac status is being monitored due to high-grade cardiac lymphoma. An echocardiogram shows mild dilation of the left atrium and a right atrial mass that is not well defined. Other cardiac findings are within normal limits.

The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. The patient is not eligible for anticoagulation due to the DVT.

The patient's current plan includes continuing antibiotics, weaning off the BiPAP as tolerated, providing additional doses of ativan for anxiety, using albuterol/ipratropium inhalers as needed, and monitoring closely for any signs of respiratory distress or tiring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of further infections, cardiac complications related to the lymphoma and chemotherapy, and potential thromboembolic events due to the history of DVT and IVC filter placement."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of high-grade cardiac lymphoma, now presenting with pneumonia and sepsis. The patient is currently extubated and on BiPAP for respiratory distress. Sedation and vasopressors have been discontinued, and the patient appears much improved in the morning. The patient has a complex medical history and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further respiratory distress due to pneumonia and underlying COPD/asthma exacerbation. Close monitoring of respiratory rate and oxygen saturation is necessary, along with providing supplemental oxygen and continuing antimicrobial therapy.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence if infection persists or new infections occur. Monitoring blood pressure and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is crucial.

3. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Atelectasis: The patient had resolved LLL atelectasis previously, but it can recur if not properly managed. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and possibly obtaining a follow-up chest X-ray is recommended.

4. Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient may have ischemic heart disease likely secondary to demand ischemia or a primary event. Elevated cardiac enzymes could be indicative of ongoing myocardial injury. A follow-up echocardiogram should be performed to assess cardiac function.

5. Cardiac Lymphoma: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of high-grade cardiac lymphoma, now presenting with pneumonia and sepsis. The patient has experienced acute respiratory failure, resolved sepsis, left lower lobe atelectasis, ischemic heart disease, cardiac lymphoma, compromised left ventricular function, and left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is currently extubated and on BiPAP for respiratory distress. Sedation has been discontinued, and vasopressors were stopped yesterday afternoon. The patient appears much improved this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's current symptoms of respiratory distress, along with the presence of pneumonia on imaging, suggest ongoing infection in the lungs. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms and ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy is continued.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk for recurrent septic episodes, especially if the source of infection is not adequately treated. Close monitoring of vital signs and early recognition of any signs of infection or organ dysfunction is crucial.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent episode of acute respiratory failure highlights the potential for severe respiratory compromise. Continued monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, along with readiness to provide respiratory support if needed, is essential.

4. Cardiac Lymphoma: The patient's history of cardiac lymphoma raises concerns about ongoing cardiac involvement"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with high-grade cardiac lymphoma who recently completed the second cycle of chemotherapy at Hospital1. He presented with acute respiratory distress and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. The patient has been improving and is currently on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/74 to 92/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 5 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,980 mL and output of 2,220 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 240 mL. He has received a total of 1,290 mL of intravenous fluids and 171 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output is 2,220 mL.

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is using a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and has a SpO2 of 98%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH 7.30, PaCO2 28 mmHg, PaO2 95 mg/dL, HCO3- 10.4 mEq/L, and base excess -24.4. The physical examination reveals a few coarse breath sounds at the left base, but otherwise clear to auscultation. No wheezing or rales are heard.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 24.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 152 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 152 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.07 ng/mL, and troponin I of 0.08 ng/mL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical history includes high-grade cardiac lymphoma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), azithromycin, and vancomycin. The patient's allergies include terazosin.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's presentation with acute respiratory distress and LLL pneumonia indicates the possibility of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory rate appears to be related to anxiety, but close monitoring is necessary to ensure he is not tiring.

2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient's respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with high-grade cardiac lymphoma who presented with acute respiratory distress and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. He has been treated with antibiotics and is currently improving. His respiratory status is stable, and he is expected to continue weaning off the ventilator. The patient's white blood cell count is trending downward, and he remains afebrile and hemodynamically stable.

The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. He is not eligible for anticoagulation due to his high risk. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated likely due to chemotherapy. His lymphoma is being treated with chemotherapy, but the next cycle may be postponed.

The patient is advised to consume thin liquids and a soft diet, and his electrolytes should be replenished as needed. Pain management is provided with a lidoderm patch. He is being monitored closely for any signs of complications such as acute hypoxic respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or further DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pneumonia put him at risk for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is essential.

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: Although the patient's current respiratory status is improving, there is still a risk for hospital"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of high-grade cardiac lymphoma and recent pneumonia, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, cardiac lymphoma, left lower extremity (LLE) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and compromised left ventricular (LV) function. 

The patient's current condition is stable, with improvements observed in acute respiratory failure, resolved pneumonia, and sepsis. However, there are ongoing concerns regarding ischemic heart disease, cardiac lymphoma, and nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's history of pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, ARDS may develop due to the inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs.
2. Prolonged bed rest: Immobility can lead to muscle weakness, pressure ulcers, and venous thromboembolism (VTE).
3. Infection: As the patient has recently had pneumonia and sepsis, there is a risk of developing another infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of ischemic heart disease and cardiac lymphoma increases the risk of cardiac events, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has a confirmed LLE D"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yom high grade cardiac lymphoma, now with pneumonia, sepsis.
   ACUTE RESPIRTATORY FAILURE -- Resolved.  Suspect multifactorial,
   including LLL pneumonia (HAP), COPD/asthma exacerbation.   Plan monitor
   RR, SaO2, provide oxygen, continue antimicrobials.
   F/U CXR.  Continue albuterol nebs.
   RLL PNEUMONIA -- continue antimicrobials.
   SEPSIS -- Resoved.  Monitor BP, maintaining MAP >60 mmHg.
   LLL ATALECTASIS --   Resolved.  Monitor.
   ISHCEMIC HEART DISEASE - likely secondary or demand ischemia, rather
   than primary event. [**Month (only) 8**] also be component of cardiac involvement of
   lymphoma (if remains elevated).  Check Echo in AM.
   CARDIAC LYMPHOMA -- s/p recent chemotherapy.  Mild compromised LV
   function.
   FLUIDS -- repleting.  Monitor I/O, maintain CVP >10 cm H2O
   LLE DVT -- s/p IVC filter.  Monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate sips.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of high-grade cardiac lymphoma, now presenting with pneumonia, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia, sepsis, left lower lobe (LLL) atelectasis, ischemic heart disease, cardiac lymphoma, compromised left ventricular (LV) function, fluid repletion, left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and nutritional support initiation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, not overweight/obese, thin, anxious, or diaphoretic.
- Vital signs: Heart rate (HR) of 109 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 133/77 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on nasal cannula, temperature (Tmax) of 36.9Â°C, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 3 mmHg.
- Respiratory system: Clear breath sounds with crackles in the posterior right lower lobe, no wheezing, bronchial breath sounds, or diminished breath sounds.
- Cardiovascular system: Normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, S3, S4, rub, or loud S2.
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present, no distention, tenderness, or obesity.
- Neurologic system: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, purposeful movement, normal tone, no sedation or paralysis.
- Laboratory results: Hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.5 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) of 24.2 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 227 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.07, TCO2 of 28, glucose of 152 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient's medical complications include acute respiratory failure, resolved; RLL pneumonia, ongoing; sepsis, resolved; LLL atelectasis, resolved; ischemic heart disease; cardiac lymphoma with compromised LV function; fluid repletion; LLE DVT with IVC filter placement; and nutritional support initiation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of RLL pneumonia, recurrence of sepsis, development of new lung infections, cardiac complications related to ischemic heart disease and cardiac lymphoma, worsening LV function, deep vein thrombosis, and malnutrition."
