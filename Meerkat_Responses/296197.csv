","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, bilateral pulmonary emboli, and suspected cord compression. She has a history of herpes ophthalmicus, for which she has been taking acyclovir for the past two years. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 89/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The patient is currently on bedrest with TLSO brace and logroll precautions due to the T6 vertebral body collapse and suspected cord compression. She is also on subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cord compression: The patient has evidence of cord compression on MRI, which can lead to neurological symptoms if not managed properly.
2. Pulmonary emboli: The patient has bilateral pulmonary emboli, which can cause respiratory distress and potentially fatal complications if further embolization occurs.
3. Metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma: The patient has metastatic lung cancer that requires tissue diagnosis and further management, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
4. Herpes ophthalmicus: The patient has a history of herpes ophthalmicus, which requires ongoing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma and bilateral pulmonary emboli. She presented to the hospital with suspected cord compression, but neurological symptoms were likely due to pain rather than the T6 lesion. She is currently clinically stable and has been evaluated by neurosurgery. CT scans of the thoracic and lumbar spine are pending for further evaluation. The patient is advised to have bedrest, wear a TLSO brace, and take logroll precautions until the brace is obtained. Neurosurgery recommends against the use of steroids. Consultations with the radiation oncology and hematology/oncology teams have been scheduled.

The patient has a history of pulmonary emboli, for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter will be placed by interventional radiology (IR). She also has bronchogenic carcinoma that requires tissue diagnosis. Pulmonary consultation has been scheduled, and a bronchoscopic biopsy is planned for today. The possibility of external beam radiation therapy (XRT) is being considered, and the patient will be consulted with a radiation oncologist in the morning.

The patient also has a history of herpes ophthalmicus, which has been treated with acyclovir. She will continue taking acyclovir and will be followed up with outpatient care.

Additionally, the patient presents with leukocytosis and hyperglycemia, which are mild and likely related to prednisone use. Her electrolytes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of likely metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, bilateral pulmonary emboli, and back pain. She was transferred from another hospital for evaluation of cord compression. The patient is currently stable, with no evidence of neurologic symptoms consistent with the T6 lesion seen on MRI. She has been evaluated by neurosurgery and will be given clinical stability, holding on steroids per their recommendations. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 100/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals multiple metastatic lesions in the spine, right iliac bone, right hilar mass, atelectasis, prominent lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilum, and bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient's assessment and plan include cancer (malignant neoplasm), anxiety, and acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cord compression: The patient's MRI shows evidence of cord compression due to the T6 lesion. If left untreated or worsens, it can lead to neurologic deficits or paralysis.
2. Pulmonary embol"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, bilateral pulmonary emboli, and a possible cord compression. She has been experiencing back pain, and an MRI showed evidence of cord compression; however, her neurological symptoms may be related to pain rather than the T6 lesion. The patient is currently neurologically intact. She was evaluated by neurosurgery and will hold on steroids per their recommendations.

The patient is currently on bedrest with a TLSO brace, logroll precautions, and q4hr neuro checks. She is also scheduled for radiation therapy today. There is no current evidence of hemodynamic compromise from the pulmonary emboli, but further embolization could be fatal. An IVC filter has been placed to prevent further embolism.

A tissue diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma is needed, and a bronchoscopy and biopsy were performed on [**9-5**], with follow-up path report pending. Radiation therapy will also be administered today.

The patient has a history of herpes ophthalmicus, which has been treated with acyclovir, and she will continue the medication with outpatient follow-up.

There are mild leukocytosis and hyperglycemia, which are likely related to prednisone use. A social work consult has been requested.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition with full liquid diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. Her lines include an 18-gauge line placed on [**2155-9-6**] at 04:00 AM. She is on SQ UF heparin for DVT prophylaxis and VAP prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and she is scheduled for transfer to the floor."
