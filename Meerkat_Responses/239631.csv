","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was admitted for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) on the native omohyoid artery (OM2). The patient's symptoms include symptomatic bradycardia, chest pain with hypertension, and intermittent second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block with junctional escape beats. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. CAD: The patient likely has stable angina due to inadequate revascularization of the OM2 territory. Medical management is being continued.
- Hold beta-blocker for bradycardia.
- High-dose statin therapy.
- ACE inhibitor.
- Continue isosorbide dinitrate (Cont isolation).
- Control hypertension.

2. PUMP: The patient has an ejection fraction of 55-60% and mild aortic stenosis. The echo peak gradient is 38, mean 24. The patient appears euvolemic at this time.
- Monitor volume status.

3. Rhythm: The patient has intermittent 1-17 second pauses on telemetry with junctional escape beats. He is symptomatic with chest pain possibly due to coronary hypoperfusion. This may be"

He was admitted for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and had an unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) on the native obtuse marginal artery (OM2). The patient presented with symptomatic bradycardia and chest pain with hypertension.

Assessment:
1. CAD/Stable Angina: The patient has lateral ST depressions with chest pain, indicating stable angina. Medical management is being continued, including antiplatelet therapy, statin, ACE inhibitor, and nitrates.
2. Sinus Pauses: The patient has intermittent sinus pauses on telemetry, ranging from 1 to 17 seconds, with junctional escape beats. This is likely due to sinus node dysfunction, possibly exacerbated by the last dose of beta-blocker almost 48 hours ago. A pacemaker is planned to be inserted on Monday.
3. HTN: The patient's blood pressure remains inadequately controlled, with SBP's in the 140's to 170's. Medications include lisinopril, amlodipine (recently changed to nifedipine), and titration of imdur. Clonidine may also be started.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He was admitted for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and had unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) on the native omohyoid artery. The patient's course is marked by symptomatic bradycardia and chest pain with hypertension. He has lateral ST depressions with chest pain, but revascularization of the omohyoid territory is not possible. The patient is currently being treated with medical management.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Continue antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.
2. Hold beta-blocker due to symptomatic bradycardia and pauses.
3. Simvastatin for cholesterol management.
4. Continue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) for blood pressure control.
5. Continue nitrates for angina symptoms.
6. Consider ranolazine for anginal symptoms.
7. Plan for pacemaker insertion to address sinus pauses.
8. Adjust antihypertensive therapy, including adding clonidine or nifedipine, and titrating imdur.
9. Follow up on spinal stenosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, and depression/anxiety.
10. Replete electrolytes and provide cardiac diet.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previously underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and is currently admitted for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient experienced an episode of chest pain (CP) at 10:45 AM with dynamic ST depression on electrocardiogram (EKG), which improved with nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate (HR) of 68 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 139/51 mmHg to 157/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals a prominent arterial pulsation in the neck without jugular venous distention (JVD), a third heart sound (S3) with an early harsh crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the base, clear lungs with no wheezing or crackles, and a right groin hematoma with echymosis extending down to the scrotum and penis. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 28.0 g/dL, platelet count of 250 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.8 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.17, and other abnormalities. The patient's medical management includes optimizing medical therapy including aggressive control of hypertension, holding beta-blocker due to bradycardia, high-dose statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), titrating up isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), and controlling blood pressure. The patient's rhythm is described as intermittent first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block with junctional escape beats, and there are plans for follow-up with electrophysiology (EP) for possible pacemaker consideration. Other ongoing assessments and plans include monitoring fluid status, addressing uncontrolled hypertension, managing spinal stenosis with percoset PRN, managing diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) with insulin sliding scale and oral medications, managing dementia/depression/anxiety with Aricept and Lexapro, and repleting electrolytes. The patient's code status is full code, and the current ICU care includes nutrition, lines, prophylaxis, communication, and disposition."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 M with CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2, SVG-PDA) and DES to
   OM2 in [**2180**] admitted for NSTEMI and had subsequent unsucessful PTA on
   the native OM2.  Course marked by symtomatic bradycardia and chest pain
   with hypertension.
   .
   # CAD.  Lateral STD's with chest pain concerning but unable to
   revascularize the OM2 territory by cath.  EKG changes and + stress test
   at OSH seem to suggest large ischemic burden.  Options include medical
   management vs. redo-CABG.  However, given age, dementia, bradycardia,
   favor optimizing medical therapy including aggressive control of
   hypertension for now.
   -- asa, plavix (need to hold if planning for CT [**Doctor First Name **])
   -- hold bblocker for bradycardia
   -- high dose statin
   -- ace-i
   -- titrate up imdur
   -- control htn
   .
   # PUMP: Inferior HK but EF 55-60%.  Mild AS which likely does not
   explain the fall in BP when SL nitro was given; futhermore patient
   already taking Imdur.  Echo peak gradient 38, mean 24.  Seems euvolemic
   at this time
   -- monitor volume status
   .
   # Rhythm: Intermittent [**1-17**] second pauses on telemetry with 6 second
   pauses recorded, with junctional escape beats.  Symtomatic with chest
   pain possibly due to coronary hypoperfusion.  Likely sinus node
   dysfunction and last dose of bblocker almost 48 hours ago.
   -- f/u EP for possible pacemaker
   .
   # Htn: Inadequately controlled on the floor with SBP's in the 140's to
   170's.
   -- continue lisinopril 40, amlodipine 10
   -- titrate up imdur
   -- can also start clonidine (hydral less ideal)
   .
   # Spinal Stenosis: Patient was evaluated at OSH for possibility of
   epidural block.
   -- percoset PRN
   .
   # DM2: continue ISS and lantus. On d/c will likely be able to take his
   oral medications again.
   .
   # Dementia/depression/anxiety: Will continue Aricept and lexapro
   .
   # FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Cardiac diet. No IVF at
   present.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He was admitted for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and had an unsuccessful peripheral transatlantic (PTA) on the native omohyoid muscle (OM2). The patient experienced symptomatic bradycardia and chest pain with hypertension. There were lateral ST depression's on EKG and positive stress test at OSH, suggesting a large ischemic burden. The patient's condition is being managed medically, with options including medical management versus redo-CABG. The patient has been placed on aggressive control of hypertension, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), beta-blockers (BB), high-dose statins, nitrates, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's low heart rate could lead to inadequate cardiac output and reduced blood flow to vital organs.
2. Hypertension: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can strain the heart and increase the risk of further cardiac events or complications.
3. Coronary Hypoperfusion: Reduced blood flow to the heart muscles due to coronary artery disease may result in inadequate oxygen supply, leading to ischemic damage.
4. Junctional Escape Beats: Intermittent pauses in the heart rhythm may indicate sinus node dysfunction, which could compromise cardiac output"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had subsequent unsuccessful peripheral transluminal angioplasty (PTA) on the native om2. He was admitted for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and has been experiencing symptomatic bradycardia, chest pain with hypertension, and lateral ST depressions. The patient's current condition appears to be stable angina, and medical management is being continued.

Medical Complications:
1. Sinus pauses: The patient is experiencing intermittent sinus pauses on telemetry, with the longest recorded pause being 6 seconds. These pauses are likely due to sinus node dysfunction and may be related to coronary hypoperfusion causing chest pain. A pacemaker is planned to be inserted on Monday.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still not adequately controlled, with readings in the 140's to 170's. Medications such as lisinopril, amlodipine, nifedipine, imdur, and clonidine are being considered for titration to achieve better blood pressure control.
3. Spinal stenosis: The patient was evaluated for the possibility of an epidural block due to spinal stenosis. He is currently prescribed percocet as needed for pain relief.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and had unsuccessful peripheral transluminal angioplasty (PTA) on the native om2. The patient experienced symptomatic bradycardia, chest pain, hypertension, and intermittent sinus pauses on telemetry. The patient's condition has been marked by coronary hypoperfusion, likely sinus node dysfunction, and stable angina.

Medical Complications:
1. Sinus node dysfunction: The patient experienced intermittent sinus pauses with junctional escape beats. This suggests possible sinus node dysfunction, which may require a pacemaker insertion.
2. Uncontrolled hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been inadequately controlled, ranging from 140's to 170's on the floor. Adjustments to antihypertensive medications are needed.
3. Stable angina: The patient has lateral ST depression with chest pain, indicating stable angina. Medical management is being continued with antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker hold due to bradycardia, statin therapy, ACE inhibitor, nitrates, and ranolazine for anginal symptoms.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2): The patient's DM2 is being managed with insulin and will likely be transitioned to oral medications upon discharge.
5. Spinal stenosis: The patient was evaluated for the possibility of an epidural block.
6. Dementia/depression/anxiety: The patient is on Aricept and Lexapro for these conditions.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes need to be monitored and repleted as necessary.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) at the moment, and nutrition should be assessed and addressed accordingly.
9. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and careful monitoring and management are required.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient is receiving heparin subcutaneously three times a day.
11. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
12. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): VAP prevention measures should be implemented.
13. Pacemaker insertion: The patient is planned to have a pacemaker inserted today due to symptomatic bradycardia and sinus pauses.

Please note that the information provided is a summary of the patient's medical history, current condition, and potential medical complications. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate management."
