   to have large saddle emboli and e/o RV strain.
   .
   # Pulmonary Embolism: Currently HD stable with SBP > 100 and HR in low
   100s.  Patient with adequate O2 saturation on 6L but with increased
   WOB.  Etiology could be immobility with recent surgergy and rehab vs.
   hypercoaguable state from ?FH with father having [**Name2 (NI) **] clot.  With
   severe underlying COPD, will need to maximize pulmonary dynamics.
   - Heparin gtt for goal PTT 60-100
   - Follow up LENI and ECHO
   - Monitoring with Telemetry and A line
   - Follow-up cardiac surgery / thoracics recommendations
   - Hold TPA unless e/o HD compromise such as SBP < 90, HR > 120, hypoxia
   not fixed by supplemental O2 alone
   - Continue COPD treatment: Advair, tiotroprium, Albuterol PRN and
   steroid taper
   - Oxycodone for pain relief
   .
   # RV strain: Concerning on EKG and by CTA.  Given current hemodynamics,
   is very pre-load dependent.  Does have 18g IV x 3.
   - Given FENa of 0, and BUN/Cr > 20 and a high urine specific gravity,
   we can be confident that patient requires fluid resuscitation.
   Currently running at 250mL/hr of NS, and will decrease to 125mL/hr
   after the first liter.
   - Re-evaluate in PM.
   - If acute decompensation, consider TPA and continue IVF

   # COPD: Signficant underlying disease.  Likely contributing to overall
   pulmonary compromise with tacypnea not helpful given need to have
   prolonged expiration.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She presented with acute hypoxemia during rehabilitation and was found to have large saddle emboli and evidence of right ventricular strain.

The patient's current condition is stable with a systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg and a heart rate in the low 100s. She has adequate oxygen saturation on 6 liters of oxygen but experiences increased work of breathing. The etiology of her condition could be related to immobility from recent surgery and rehabilitation or a hypercoagulable state due to a family history of thrombosis.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient will be started on heparin drip for a goal PTT of 60-100. Follow-up with a lung scan (LENI) and echocardiogram (ECHO) will be conducted. Telemetry and arterial line monitoring will be continued. Cardiac surgery/thoracics recommendations will be followed up on, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) will be held unless there is evidence of hemodynamic compromise such as systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, heart rate above 120 beats per minute, or hypoxia not corrected by supplemental oxygen alone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who underwent cardiovascular surgery and received thrombolytic therapy, which was deferred. The patient's urine output has been low despite receiving 2.5 liters of fluid. An arterial line was started at 09:56 PM on [**2180-11-22**]. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion. Other medications and ICU medications are also being administered. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 100-112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/79 to 93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Flow sheet data shows fluid balance with total inputs of 622 mL and 972 mL, total outputs of 200 mL and 105 mL, resulting in a balance of 422 mL and 867 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, PaO2 of 304, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 304.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pulmonary emboli (""saddle"")
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to actue pulmonary embolism, on
   background of COPD and partial RUL resection.  Treat PE, continue COPD
   medications.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- ""saddle"" by CT angio;  therapeutic on iv
   Heparin.  Evidence for RV strain by echo in ER --> repeat formal study
   to assess RV function (may have underlying pulmonary hypertension
   related to COPD).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to extensive pulmonary embolism.  Continue
   supplimentall oxygen --> maintain >90%.
   OLIGURIA -- prerenal; improved with iv fluids.  Monitor uo, BUN,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic;  receiving iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   s/p RUL RESECTION, partial (wedge) -- no further plans.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, which is attributed to acute pulmonary embolism on the background of COPD and partial right upper lobe (RUL) resection. Treatment for the PE includes therapeutic IV heparin, and the patient will continue COPD medications.

2. The patient has a confirmed pulmonary embolism, described as a ""saddle"" embolism by CT angiography. There is evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain by echo in the emergency room, so a repeat formal study is planned to assess RV function. There is a concern for underlying pulmonary hypertension related to COPD.

3. The patient is also experiencing hypoxemia, attributed to the extensive pulmonary embolism. Supplemental oxygen will be continued to maintain an oxygen saturation level of >90%.

4. Oliguria, or decreased urine output, has been observed and is believed to be prerenal in origin. It has improved with IV fluids, and the plan is to monitor urine output (uo), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.

5. The patient is hypovolemic and is receiving IV fluids. Fluid balance will be closely monitored.

6. The patient has undergone a partial RUL resection (wedge resection) in the past, and no"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), attributed to the presence of a saddle embolus seen on CT angio. The PE is believed to be the cause of the patient's respiratory distress, which is further complicated by underlying COPD and partial right upper lobe (RUL) resection. The patient is currently receiving therapeutic doses of intravenous (IV) heparin. An echocardiogram performed in the emergency room (ER) revealed evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain, and a repeat formal study has been ordered to assess RV function. It is suspected that the patient may have underlying pulmonary hypertension related to COPD. Hypoxemia has been attributed to the extensive PE, and supplemental oxygen is being administered to maintain oxygen saturation levels above 90%. Oliguria has been observed, likely due to prerenal causes, and has improved with IV fluids. Monitoring of urine output (uo), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels is ongoing. The patient is also being monitored for fluid balance and is receiving IV fluids to address hypovolemia. No further plans are in place for the partial RUL resection. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition remains in the intensive care unit (ICU). Total time spent at the patient's bedside is 55 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4th. She presented with acute hypoxemia during rehabilitation and was found to have large saddle emboli along with right ventricular strain. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in both lower extremities. The source of the emboli is suspected to be immobility with recent surgery and rehab versus a hypercoagulable state from a possible family history of clotting disorder. 

The patient's current condition is stable with blood pressure ranging from 100-120 and heart rate in the 90-100 range. She has been weaned down from 6 liters of oxygen and is now on 2 liters with adequate oxygen saturation, although she experiences mild shortness of breath. Her ECHO showed a severely dilated right ventricle with moderate hypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, but the left ventricle function is preserved.

The patient is receiving heparin through a continuous infusion to maintain a target partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-100. She will also begin a coumadin bridge with Coumadin 5mg PO qday for the next two days and discuss the regimen on Monday. The patient is being monitored with telemetry and arterial line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**].
- She presented with acute hypoxemia during rehabilitation and was found to have large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain.
- She is currently in the ICU and has been stable with systolic blood pressure above 100 and heart rate in the low 100s. Her oxygen saturation is adequate on 6 liters of supplemental oxygen, but she has increased work of breathing.
- The possible etiology of her pulmonary embolism could be immobility with recent surgery and rehabilitation, or a hypercoagulable state from her family history with her father having a clot.
- She also has severe underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and will need to maximize pulmonary dynamics.
- She is receiving heparin intravenously for a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-100.
- Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin T levels, but other values are within normal range.
- The patient has been started on COPD treatment with Advair, tiotropium, albuterol as needed, and a steroid taper for pain relief.
- There are concerns about right ventricular strain, which is preload-dependent and requires close monitoring.
- Fluid resuscitation with normal saline at a rate of 250 mL/hr is being administered and will be decreased to 125 mL/hr after the first liter.
- The patient's underlying COPD is significant and likely contributing to overall pulmonary compromise.
- She will continue on COPD medications and steroid taper.
- The surgical incision from the thoracotomy is healing well.
- There is a recent history of nausea and vomiting, which may be due to a recent illness or possible medication side effects.
- The patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and will continue using CPAP inpatient.
- Her hyperglycemia may be due to the use of steroids, and she will continue on her current medication regimen.
- The patient's diet is being advanced to regular, and she is NPO (nothing by mouth).
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU until further improvement."

","The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She presented with acute hypoxemia during rehabilitation and was found to have large saddle emboli and evidence of right ventricular strain.

Assessment:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with blood pressure ranging from 100-120 mmHg and heart rate in the 90-100 beats per minute range. She has adequate oxygen saturation on 6 liters of supplemental oxygen but experiences increased work of breathing. The etiology could be immobility with recent surgery and rehab versus a hypercoagulable state from a possible family history of clotting disorder. With severe underlying COPD, pulmonary dynamics need to be maximized. Bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis were shown on lower extremity venous ultrasound, suggesting a source for the emboli. The echo showed a severely dilated right ventricle with moderate hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, consistent with hemodynamically significant pulmonary emboli. The left ventricle has preserved regional and global function but is likely underfilled.
2. RV Strain: Concerning findings on echo, EKG, and CTA indicate right ventricular strain. The patient is preload-dependent and has low urine output. A 250cc normal saline"

","The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with right upper lobe lung resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She presented with acute hypoxemia during rehab and was found to have large saddle emboli and evidence of right ventricular strain. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she appears more comfortable, able to speak in whole sentences, and has well healing incisions. However, she exhibits intermittent tachycardia and tachypnea. Her extremities show warm and well-pulsating blood flow without erythema or signs of peripheral thrombosis. Neurological examination is non-focal.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of leukocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, and liver enzymes are within normal limits. The patient's troponin-T level is normal, but there is an elevated lactate level.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with right upper lobe lung resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She presented with acute hypoxemia during rehabilitation and was found to have large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain. The patient is currently stable on hemodynamic support, with a blood pressure range of 100-120 mmHg and heart rate in the 90-100s. She is adequately oxygenated on 6 liters of supplemental oxygen but experiences increased work of breathing. The etiology of the pulmonary embolism could be immobility following surgery and rehabilitation or a hypercoagulable state from a possible familial hypercoagulability disorder. The patient also has underlying severe COPD and requires maximal pulmonary dynamics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has already been diagnosed with a large saddle emboli causing right ventricular strain. There is a potential risk of further complications such as recurrent pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension.
2. Right Ventricular Failure: The severely dilated right ventricle with moderate hypokinesis suggests the possibility of right ventricular failure. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's underlying severe COPD, along with the presence of tachypnea and increased work of breathing, may"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is hypoxemia, and they are critically ill. The patient has a history of respiratory distress, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, hypotension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

From the review of systems, the patient does not have any constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or weight loss. There are no eye or ear, nose, throat abnormalities. The cardiovascular system shows no chest pain, palpitations, edema, tachycardia, or orthopnea. The respiratory system is clear with no cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, or wheeze. The gastrointestinal system is normal with no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. The genitourinary system is also normal with no dysuria or dialysis. There are no musculoskeletal issues, and the skin shows no jaundice or rash. The endocrine system reveals hyperglycemia but no history of thyroid disease. The heme/lymphatic system is normal with no anemia or coagulopathy. Neurologic symptoms such as numbness, tingling, headache, or seizures are absent. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears comfortable without any pain. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/69 mmHg to 131/80 mmHg"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions and complications. They are experiencing respiratory distress attributed to a pulmonary embolism, heart failure with evidence of right heart strain, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypotension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, acute renal failure, and a history of tracheobronchomalacia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: This condition involves a blood clot blocking one of the pulmonary arteries, leading to impaired oxygenation and potential respiratory failure.
2. Heart failure: The right heart strain suggests that the patient's heart may not be able to effectively pump blood, potentially resulting in fluid accumulation and organ dysfunction.
3. Obstructive sleep apnea: This chronic condition causes interrupted breathing during sleep, leading to reduced oxygen levels and potential daytime sleepiness or fatigue.
4. Hypotension: Low blood pressure can compromise organ perfusion and lead to tissue damage or organ failure if not managed promptly.
5. COPD exacerbation: Acute worsening of COPD symptoms can result in increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, and increased risk of respiratory infections.
6. Acute renal failure: Kidney dysfunction can occur due to decreased blood flow or damage to the renal tissues, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Tracheobronchomalacia: Weakened walls of the trachea or bronchi"

   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty. She is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation, with large saddle emboli and evidence of right ventricular strain. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and creatinine levels. The INR is at 1.2 and PTT is at 76.7 seconds.

The patient's current medical issues include pulmonary embolism, RV strain, underlying COPD, recent surgery (thoracotomy and tracheo/bronchoplasty), nausea/vomiting, possible deep vein thrombosis, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperglycemia, and fluid overload.

The plan includes continuing COPD treatment, initiating heparin therapy for the pulmonary embolism, starting Coumadin bridge, monitoring with telemetry and arterial line, holding tissue plasminogen activator unless there is hemodynamic compromise, providing pain relief, advancing diet,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehab, and it was found that she has large saddle emboli and evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain.

The patient is stable with systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 100-120 mmHg and heart rate (HR) in the 90-100s. She has been weaned down from 6L O2 and is currently on 2L with adequate oxygen saturation but experiences mild shortness of breath (SOB). Bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses (LE DVTs) were discovered, suggesting a potential source could be immobility with recent surgery and rehab or a hypercoagulable state from her father's history of a clot.

The patient's underlying severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires maximizing pulmonary dynamics. An echocardiogram showed a dilated RV with moderate hypokinesis and pulmonary arterial hypertension with preserved left ventricular global function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute renal failure, hypokalemia (low potassium), and pulmonary embolism. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including NAC, steroids, and Coumadin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for respiratory support and is receiving intravenous fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and potentially require renal replacement therapy.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening. Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory distress or new-onset hemodynamic instability is crucial.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications. Monitoring potassium levels and administering potassium supplements if necessary is important.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to various factors such as infection"

s and HR in
   90-100s.  Patient weaned down from 6L O2 with current adequate O2
   saturation on 2L but with mild SOB.  LENI showed Bil LE DVTs; etiology
   suggesting source could be immobility with recent surgery and rehab vs.
   hypercoaguable state from ?FH with father having [**Name2 (NI) **] clot.  With
   severe underlying COPD, will need to maximize pulmonary dynamics. ECHO
   showed dilated RV with mod hypokinesis and pulm art HTN with preserved
   LV global function.

   - Heparin gtt per SS for goal PTT 60-100. Will cont. coumadin bridge
   with 5mg PO qday for the next two days and discuss regimen on Monday.
   - Monitoring with Telemetry and A line
   - Hold TPA unless e/o HD compromise such as SBP < 90, HR > 120, hypoxia
   not fixed by supplemental O2 alone; CT of head neg reassuring if TPA is
   necessary.
   - Continue COPD treatment: Advair, tiotroprium, Albuterol PRN and
   steroid taper
   - Oxycodone for pain relief
   .
   # RV strain: Concerning on ECHO, EKG and CTA.  Given current
   hemodynamics, pt is very pre-load dependent.   Does have 18g IV x 3.
   - Re-evaluate in UOP PM, and dose IVF accordingly.
   - If acute decompensation, consider TPA and continue IVF
   .
   # COPD: Significant underlying disease.  Likely contributing to overall
   pulmonary compromise with tachypnea not helpful given need to have
   prolonged expiration.
   - Continue COPD meds
   - Continue steroid taper (currently at Prednisone 10mg PO daily #[**3-6**]
   days), with ISS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She presented with acute hypoxemia from rehab and was found to have large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain. The patient has been on heparin and started on coumadin. She is currently hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure range of 100-120 and heart rate in the 90-100s. She has mild shortness of breath and is weaned down from 6L O2, currently maintaining adequate oxygen saturation on 2L.

The patient has bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), with the source potentially being immobility from recent surgery and rehab or a hypercoagulable state from a family history of thrombosis. An echo showed dilated right ventricle with moderate hypokinesis and pulmonary artery hypertension with preserved left ventricular global function.

The plan includes continuing COPD treatment, monitoring with telemetry and arterial line, holding tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) unless there is evidence of hemodynamic compromise such as systolic blood pressure less than 90, heart rate greater than 120, hypoxia not fixed by supplemental O2 alone, and reassurance if TPA is necessary. The patient will receive pain relief with oxycodone, and"
