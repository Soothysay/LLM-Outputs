   - Patient received 12 [**Location 392**], 5 [**Location 8394**], and 1 U of cryo
   - Given 30 mcg of DDAVP
   - Intubated for emergent EGD
   - GI performed EGD, which showed: Esophageal varices, Blood in the
   stomach, Blood in the duodenal bulb and second part of the duodenum
   A large visible vessel was seen in the proximal duodenum and appeared
   to be the source of bleeding. This vessel likely represents vessel in
   an ulcer base, and less likely a duodenal varix. (injection, thermal
   therapy)
   - CVL and arterial line placed
   - Renal was C/S for ARF in the setting of massive GIB: Cr improved to
   1.5 from 3, so it is thought that this is more likely [**2-6**] pre-renal
   intravascular depletion.  Continue aggressive fluid repletion, check

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o M with PMHx of etoh cirrhosis is transfered to MICU after
   developing GIB and noted to have acute anemia, leukocytosis and
   elevated INR.
   # GIB: Duodenal ulcer. HCT stable overnight.
   - pIVx3
   - t/s + crossmatch
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI and octreotide ggt
   - HCT>30, PLT>50, INT<1.5
   - hold BB, antihypertensives
   - GI to scope in am (would do both EGD and colonoscopy)
   # Bradycardia: sinus
   - monbitor
   - atropine/lifepoac at baseline
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection
   - RISBI 15, extubate later
   - CXR with r hilar fullnea but no fever, improving wbcs
   # Leukocytosis:Likely SBP but para without PMNs. Cx pnd
   - zosyn, if negative cx then CTX
   - monitor
   # Acute renal failure: cre improving to 1..8. Likely volume depletion
   but urine Na high, so still suspect a intrinsic component.
   - urine output still oligouric
   - monitor
   # Non anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: HCO3 improving to
   15.  Likely secondary to loose stool and GI losses.
   - NaHCO3 ggt if worsens
   # Cirrhosis: EtOH
   - impared synthetic function: reverse INR, follow bili
   - hepatic encephalopathy: lactulose/rifaximin
   - grade 1 varices: holding nadolol, PPI [**Hospital1 **], monitor for emesis
   - ascites: holding diuretics, dx para in am
   # EtOH abuse: last drink 3 wks ago.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of etoh cirrhosis who was admitted to the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and acute anemia. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 108/64 mmHg and a heart rate of 44 bpm. He is intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, which has led to complications such as portal hypertension, resulting in esophageal varices and duodenal ulcer bleeding. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed esophageal varices, blood in the stomach, and blood in the duodenal bulb. A large visible vessel was seen in the proximal duodenum, likely representing a vessel in an ulcer base, and less likely a duodenal varix.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with an initial creatinine level of 3. However, it has improved to 1.5 after aggressive fluid repletion. His liver function tests show elevated bilirubin levels and prolonged prothrombin time (INR) due to impaired synthetic function. He also has metabolic acidosis with a decreased bicarbonate level.

The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (pro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter placement. He has undergone an endoscopy, which revealed esophageal varices, blood in the stomach, and blood in the duodenal bulb. A large visible vessel in the proximal duodenum was seen, likely representing a vessel in an ulcer base.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level was initially high at 3 but improved to 1.5. It is suspected to be pre-renal intravascular depletion. Aggressive fluid repletion and daily monitoring of urine sodium, osmolality, and intravesicular pressure are recommended to keep it below 20.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and a respiratory system compliance of 15. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has impaired synthetic function indicated by an elevated INR. Lactulose and rifaximin may be considered for treatment.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's etiology of cirrhosis is related to"

   ulcer. Continued slow HCT drop overnight, s/p transfusion of PRBC with
   appropriate increase in hct, without evidence of active GIB now. Will
   plan to extubate and to continue to observe (after discussion with GI
   to ensure that he does not need another procedure). If bleeding recurs,
   GI will likely repeat endoscopy given another possible source more
   distal in the duodenum. IR would be the next option. Adequate access.
   The etiology of the ulcer is unclear
 will try to obtain a better
   history. H.pylori antibodies reportedly negative in the past.
   Etiology of acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, possible
   pre-renal vs. intrinsic renal vs. HRS. Renal impression is ATN. Appears
   to be improving with aggressive fluid resuscitation and after

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with life-threatening bleeding from a duodenal ulcer. The patient underwent clipping of a visible vessel within the ulcer. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various infusions including pantoprazole (Protonix), octreotide, and propofol.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension (blood pressure of 115/69 mmHg) and bradycardia (heart rate of 48 bpm). He has been sedated and unable to provide a history. Allergies are not reported.

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. His liver function tests show elevated ALT and AST levels, while his bilirubin levels are within normal range. The platelet count is low at 104 K/uL.

Imaging reveals improved lung volumes and an endotracheal tube in place. The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender, distended abdomen with edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's current medical conditions include renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. The etiology of the ulcer is unclear, and the cause of acute renal failure is suspected to be multifactorial.

The plan includes continued observation after extubation, ensuring no further gastrointestinal bleeding. If bleeding recurs,"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis who presented with life-threatening bleeding from a duodenal ulcer. The patient underwent clipping of a visible vessel within the ulcer. The patient's condition overnight showed continued slow HCT drop, and he received a transfusion of PRBC to increase his HCT without evidence of active GIB. The plan is to extubate the patient and continue to observe, ensuring that he does not require another procedure. If bleeding recurs, a repeat endoscopy may be performed to identify another possible source of bleeding in the duodenum. If necessary, interventional radiology (IR) would be the next option. The etiology of the ulcer is unclear, and obtaining a better history is planned as H.pylori antibodies were reported negative in the past.

The patient's renal failure is likely multifactorial, possibly pre-renal, intrinsic renal, or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The renal impression is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and appears to be improving with aggressive fluid resuscitation.

ICU care includes nutrition support (NPO for now due to GIB), glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and various lines inserted for monitoring and treatment. Prophylaxis measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with boots and systemic anticoagulation, and ventilator-associated pneumonia"

   # Leukocytosis:  Improving.  Likely SBP but para without PMNs. Cx pnd.
   - will d/c zosyn and start ciprofloxacin
   - f/u cx data
   - monitor
   # Acute renal failure: ATN with possible elements of HRS.
   - start midodrine and continue octreotide per liver
   - urine output improving
   - renal recs
   - monitor
   # Non anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: HCO3 improving to
   15.  Likely secondary to loose stool and GI losses.
   - NaHCO3 ggt or boluses if worsens
   # Cirrhosis: EtOH in nature
   - impared synthetic function: reverse INR, follow bili
   - hepatic encephalopathy: lactulose/rifaximin
   - grade 1 varices: holding nadolol, PPI [**Hospital1 **], monitor for emesis
   - ascites: will start lasix for LE edema.  Consider starting
   spironolactone in future.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of ethanol cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also has leukocytosis and elevated INR. He has been treated for various complications including duodenal ulcer, acute renal failure, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, cirrhosis, and ethanol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient developed GIB, which required hospitalization and treatment. There is a risk of rebleeding or ongoing bleeding.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory infections.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). There is a risk of worsening renal function and fluid imbalance.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as altered mental status or confusion.
5. Hepatocellular carcinoma: Patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Surveillance imaging may be necessary.
6. Variceal bleeding: The patient has grade 1 esophageal varices, which carry"

   - HCT>30, PLT>50, INT<1.5
   - hold BB, antihypertensives
   - Check Hct q12h
   # Respiratory: extubated
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Likely SBP but para without PMNs. Cx pnd
   - Continue Zosyn, if negative cx then CTX
   - monitor
   # Acute renal failure: ATN.
   - urine output picking up
   - renal recs
   - monitor
   # Non anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: HCO3 improving to
   15.  Likely secondary to loose stool and GI losses.
   - NaHCO3 ggt or boluses if worsens
   # Cirrhosis: EtOH in nature
   - impared synthetic function: reverse INR, follow bili
   - hepatic encephalopathy: lactulose/rifaximin

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He presented with life-threatening bleeding from a duodenal ulcer, which was successfully controlled through clipping of a visible vessel within the ulcer. The etiology of the ulcer is unclear, as H.pylori antibodies were reported to be negative in the past.

The patient's current medical conditions include bradycardia, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed (hematemesis, bloody gastric contents per nasogastric tube, GI bleed, GIB), and cirrhosis of the liver.

24-hour events:
- Urine culture was obtained on [**2164-8-24**] at 10:30 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis who was admitted to the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and acute anemia. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and was found to have a duodenal ulcer. His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has stabilized overnight, and he is no longer requiring transfusions. He is receiving octreotide and pantoprazole via continuous infusion. The target HCT is greater than 30, platelet count is greater than 50,000, and international normalized ratio (INR) should be less than 1.5. Beta-blockers and antihypertensives have been held.

The patient is intubated for airway protection due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He underwent extubation on 08/24/2164. He is currently being monitored.

Leukocytosis is improving, likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but paracentesis without neutrophil prediction (PMNs) has been pending. Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) has been discontinued, and ciprofloxacin has been started. The patient's culture data will be followed up on, and he will be monitored.

The patient has acute renal failure with possible elements of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Midodrine has been started, and oct"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of ethanol cirrhosis, who was admitted to the MICU after developing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and acute anemia. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed a duodenal ulcer. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has stabilized, and transfusions are no longer required. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, possibly due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but further investigation is needed as the paracentesis did not show any signs of infection. The patient's renal function is impaired, with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and possible elements of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient's metabolic acidosis is non-anion gap, hyperchloremic in nature and is likely secondary to gastrointestinal losses. The patient's liver function is compromised, with impaired synthetic function and evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has ascites that responded well to lasix, and consideration may be given to starting spironolactone in the future. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, with the last drink occurring three weeks ago.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can occur due to the impaired liver function and the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o M with PMHx of etoh cirrhosis is transfered to MICU after
   developing GIB and noted to have acute anemia, leukocytosis and
   elevated INR.
   # GIB: Duodenal ulcer s/p EGD. Maroon stools yesterday but HCT stable
   overnight and no longer requiring transfusions.
   - Change PPI and Octreotide from gtt to [**Hospital1 **]
   - HCT>21, PLT>50, INR<1.7
   - hold BB, antihypertensives
   - Check Hct q12h
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Pt
s platelets have been decreasing over the past
   three days.  DDx includes underlying liver disease, splenomegaly,
   medication effect (PPI)
   - Continue to monitor plts and transfuse for < 50.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   UGIB.  S/p extubation on [**2164-8-24**].
   - continue to monitor
   # Leukocytosis:  Improving.  Likely SBP but para without PMNs. Cx
   NGTD.  He was started on Cipro yesterday.
   - Continue Cipro 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 7 days and then transition to ppx dose
   # Acute renal failure: ATN with possible elements of HRS. Cr decreased
   yesterday and UOP increased dramatically.
   - Continue midodrine, albumin, and octreotide today
   - F/U renal recs
   # Non anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: HCO3 improving to
   17.  Likely secondary to loose stool and GI losses.
   - NaHCO3 ggt or boluses if worsens
   # Cirrhosis: EtOH in nature.  Asterixis increased today.
   - impared synthetic function: reverse INR, follow bili
   - hepatic encephalopathy: lactulose/rifaximin
   - grade 1 varices: holding nadolol, PPI [**Hospital1 **], monitor for emesis
   - ascites: responded very well to lasix. Consider starting
   spironolactone in future.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and acute anemia. He also has leukocytosis and elevated INR. The patient's platelet count has been decreasing over the past three days, and he is at risk for thrombocytopenia. He was intubated for airway protection due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) but has since been extubated. He is being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with antibiotics. The patient has acute renal failure with possible elements of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. He also has cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal hypertension with grade 1 varices. Additionally, the patient has a history of ethanol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has maroon stools indicating ongoing bleeding. There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of his current condition if not properly managed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing, which can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the context of his gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's increased asterixis and impaired synthetic function indicate worsening hepatic encephalopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of ethanol cirrhosis. He was transferred to the MICU after developing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and presenting with acute anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated INR. The patient had a duodenal ulcer and maroon stools but is no longer requiring transfusions. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 123/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals sclera icteric, increased asterixis, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, distended abdomen, pitting edema, and diffuse jaundice. Laboratory results show abnormal liver function tests, elevated lactate levels, and a low platelet count. The patient has several medical conditions including gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, cirrhosis, and ethanol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and the presence of maroon stools indicate a risk of ongoing bleeding. There is a possibility of further bleeding or development of complications such as hypotension, shock, or organ failure.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count"

   52M with etoh cirrhosis, presented with life-threatening bleeding from
   duodenal ulcer, s/p clipping of a visible vessel within a duodenal
   ulcer. The etiology of the ulcer is unclear. H.pylori antibodies
   reportedly negative in the past.
   - UGI bleed with blood loss anemia: stable Hct now. Continue to f/u Hct
   q12h but if stable would decrease to daily. If bleeding recurs, GI will
   consider repeat endoscopy given another possible source more distal in
   the duodenum. IR would be the next option. Adequate access.
   - Acute renal failure: creat peaked at 3.0. Etiology likely
   multifactorial, possible pre-renal vs. intrinsic renal vs. HRS. Per
   hepatology recs, will start midodrine and continue octreotide. Renal
   impression is ATN. Had improvement initially with aggressive fluid
   resuscitation and after decompression of stomach post EGD. Past 24
   hours has put out 3L fluid with no change in creatinine. Will continue
   midodrine, albumin and octreotide.
   - Cirrhosis/hyperbilirubinemia

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He presented with life-threatening bleeding from a duodenal ulcer, which was successfully treated with clipping of a visible vessel. The etiology of the ulcer is unclear, as H.pylori antibodies were reportedly negative in the past.

The patient's current condition includes electrolyte and fluid disorder, bradycardia, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. However, the patient has splenomegaly, right and left lower extremity edema, and asterixis (flapping) tremor, which may indicate hepatic encephalopathy.

The lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated total bilirubin, low albumin levels, abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR), and signs of kidney dysfunction (creatinine). The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with low potassium and sodium levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an ongoing fluid deficit, as evidenced by negative fluid balance. Diuretics (Lasix) are being used to manage fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid status and electrolytes is necessary.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, so"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. Upon reviewing the progress note, it is evident that the patient has multiple medical complications.

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in their electrolytes, as indicated by the laboratory results showing low sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and magnesium (Mg++). Additionally, there is a fluid disorder with a negative fluid balance of 1,469 mL since 12 AM.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is within the normal range at 60 bpm, which falls within the acceptable range of 56-84 bpm.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although not explicitly stated, the presence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and a history of antibiotic use suggests the possibility of a UTI.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. This can be a result of the fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as potential complications from the gastrointestinal bleeding.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by the presence of hematochezia, bradypnea, and a history of gastrointestinal issues.

6. Alcoholic Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient's history and"

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted to the MICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and was found to have acute anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated INR. The patient has a duodenal ulcer and has been experiencing maroon stools. His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has been stable overnight, and he is no longer requiring transfusions. The patient is on continuous heparin flush in both upper extremities and has an arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a duodenal ulcer, which can lead to further bleeding and potential complications such as hypotension and shock.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing over the past three days. This could be due to underlying liver disease, splenomegaly, or medication effect (PPI). If the platelet count continues to decrease, there is a risk of bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If the patient experiences respiratory distress or failure again, extubation may not be feasible.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. This could lead to complications such as sepsis or organ"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with severe duodenal ulcer bleeding and acute renal failure. The patient has undergone a gastrointestinal intervention and is currently stable with improved urine output. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Rebleeding: Despite the initial successful intervention, there is a risk of rebleeding in patients with duodenal ulcers.

2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to alcohol abuse and acute renal failure, making him susceptible to infections.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis, there is a possibility of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion and altered mental status.

4. Hepato-renal syndrome: Acute renal failure in the setting of cirrhosis can lead to hepatorenal syndrome, a condition characterized by worsening kidney function.

5. Liver failure: The patient's underlying alcoholic cirrhosis increases the risk of further liver deterioration and potential liver failure.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness can predispose the patient to developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a life-threatening condition.

7. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia and underlying cardiac abnormalities make him at"
