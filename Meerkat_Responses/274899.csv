   Assessment and Plan
   54yoM w/ a h/o ETOH abuse presents after being found down.
   # ETOH withdrawal:
   -thiamine, folate, MVI daily
   -valium 10mg IV q6hrs and CIWA scale
   # Bandemia: significant bandemia in the setting of severe physiologic
   stress.  Possible RLL infiltrate on CXR and given levofloxacin and
   flagyl in ER.
   -continue levo flagyl
   -f/u cultures
   -send sputum culture
   -culture if spikes, broaden abx if hemodynamically unstable
   #  Anion Gap Acidosis: the patient has a lactic acidosis, in addition
   to an osmolar gap.  Likely related to ETOH related ketoacidosis (+
   ketones in urine) and lactic acidosis.  Patient gives history of ETOH
   intoxication.
   -monitor gap acidosis
   -start Bicarbonate drip as has some respiratory compensation but not
   able to bring pH above 7.19
   -lactate elevation possibly elevated due to hypoperfusion related to
   relative hypotension- normalized after 7 liters of fluid.  Another
   possibility is seizure given ETOH withdrawal.
   # ARF: baseline Cr normal
   -send urine lytes
   -renal ultrasound if Cr not improved by a.m.
   #  Chest pain: ROMI, repeat EKG in a.m.
   -cycle cardiac enzymes
   -tele
    #  COPD: no diagnosis of COPD, no PFTs in system but diffuse wheezing
   and significant smoking history.
   -standing nebulizers
   -treatment for aspiration PNA
   # Hep C cirrhosis:
   -send albumin and INR
   -send LFTs
   # Nausea: send LFTs and lipase.
   -zofran prn
   # Diarrhea: send stool culture and c diff.
   # Smoking:
   -nicotine patch
   #  NSVT: non sustained VT on tele in ER.
   -start beta blocker- metoprolol 25mg po bid
   -trend cardiac enzymes as above
   -monitor on tele
   -correct pH
   -discontinue amiodarone- has rec'd bolus dose amiodarone
   -very likely secondary to electrolyte / acid base disturbances
   -echo in a.m.
   # Hypoglycemia:
   -qid fingersticks
   -unclear cause- possibly related to ETOH and poor PO intake vs.
   advanced liver disease- send INR and PT as above.

   Assessment and Plan
   54yoM w/ a h/o ETOH abuse presents after being found down.
   # ETOH withdrawal:
   -thiamine, folate, MVI daily
   -valium 10mg IV q6hrs and CIWA scale
had high Valium requirement since
   admission. Change to po.
   -Has increased O2 req
t with sedation from benzodiazepines.
   # Bandemia: significant bandemia in the setting of severe physiologic
   stress.  Possible RLL infiltrate on CXR and given levofloxacin and
   flagyl in ER.
   -continue levo and flagyl
   -f/u cultures including stool
   -send sputum culture
needs a new specimen
   -culture if spikes, broaden abx if hemodynamically unstable
   #  Anion Gap Acidosis: the patient has a lactic acidosis, in addition
   to an osmolar gap.  Likely related to ETOH related ketoacidosis (+
   ketones in urine) and lactic acidosis.  Patient gives history of ETOH
   intoxication.  Gap now 17.
   -monitor gap acidosis
   -was on bicarb gtt until this morning
making patient hypokalemic.
   -lactate elevation possibly elevated due to hypoperfusion related to
   relative hypotension- normalized after 7 liters of fluid.  Another
   possibility is seizure given ETOH withdrawal.
   # ARF: baseline Cr normal.  Much improved after aggressive hydration.
   Una <10. Patient clinically remains dry, despite aggressive IV fluid.
   Allow patient to drink to thirst and follow clinically,.
   #  Chest pain: ROMI, repeat EKG in a.m. Troponins have been negative,
   but CK elevated (expect low level rhabdo)
    #  COPD: no diagnosis of COPD, no PFTs in system but diffuse wheezing
   and significant smoking history.
   -standing nebulizers with prn. Steroids today.
   -treatment for aspiration PNA
   -Incentive spirometry
   # Hep C cirrhosis: albumin 3.1, but INR normal
   # Nausea: evidence of pancreatitis as well as alcoholic liver disease.
   Trend LFTs, likely also related to extensive electrolyte abnormalities.
   Continue prn zofran. Improved clinically.
   # Diarrhea: send stool culture and c diff.
   # Smoking:  nicotine patch
   #  NSVT: non sustained VT on tele in ER.   Aggressive electrolyte
   monitorinig and repletion. Correcting acidosis and potassium repletion
   (will need to monitor for hyperkalemia off HCO3 gtt as K released again
   from cells). Amiodarone gtt stopped at admission
   -start beta blocker- metoprolol 25mg po bid
   -trend cardiac enzymes as above
   -monitor on tele
   -correct pH
   -discontinue amiodarone- has rec'd bolus dose amiodarone
   -very likely secondary to electrolyte / acid base disturbances
   -echo in a.m.
   # Hypoglycemia:
   -qid fingersticks, allow to eat.
   -unclear cause- possibly related to ETOH and poor PO intake vs.
   advanced liver disease- send INR and PT as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with several medical complications, including:

1. ETOH-related pancreatitis and hepatitis: The patient has evidence of pancreatitis and hepatitis, likely related to excessive alcohol consumption.

2. Bandemia: The patient has a significant bandemia, which refers to an increased number of immature white blood cells in the bloodstream. This can indicate a bacterial infection or systemic inflammation.

3. Possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray: The patient has been given antibiotics and antifungal medication, suggesting a possible lung infection, such as pneumonia.

4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap. This can be caused by conditions like ethanol-related ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was normal, but it has now worsened. The patient's urine output is also low, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.

6. COPD: The patient has a history of significant smoking, which puts him at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, no formal diagnosis of COPD has been made yet.

7. Hepatitis C cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis related to hepatitis C infection. His albumin levels are slightly low, but his INR (international normalized ratio) is within normal range"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with signs and symptoms consistent with alcohol-related pancreatitis and hepatitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for multiple medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, which is being managed with thiamine, folate, MVI daily, and Valium 10mg IV q6hours. CIWA scale is also being used to monitor the patient's withdrawal symptoms.
2. Bandemia: The patient has a significant bandemia, which may indicate an infection. Possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests pneumonia, and the patient has been started on levofloxacin and flagyl. Cultures are being sent, and further antibiotic therapy will be based on culture results.
3. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis in addition to an osmolar gap. This is likely related to alcohol-related ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis. The patient's pH is below 7.19, and a bicarbonate drip has been started. Lactate elevation could be due to hypoperfusion or seizure activity associated with alcohol withdrawal.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine is normal, but there is a concern for renal failure. Urine lytes and renal ultrasound will be sent if the patient's creat"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9400**] is a 54M who presents with ETOH intoxication, now with
   tremulousness with concern for withdrawal. He has a past med history of
   Afib, ETOH abuse, ETOH and hep C cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy. On
   presentation to the ED he was found to have a lactate of ~ 9, and was
   given about 7 liters of fluid, which likely accounts for his tachypnea
   and bilateral rales. His lactate has improved to ~ 2 and his HCO3 has
   risen to 10 from 6.
   Exam notable for BP 137/94 HR 114 RR 30 with sat94% on 3 li/min NC. His
   lung exam shows bilateral rales halfway up both lungs, cardiac exam
   does not reveal S3/S4. Abdomen distended but tympanitic, with liver
   edge palpable about 4 cm below CM. Extremities without edema. No spider
   angioma detected, although upper chest is flushed. Labs notable
   metabolic acidosis and renal insufficiency, also with bandemia.  EKG is
   sinus tach with no STTWC. Agree with plan to monitor for w/drawal and
   treat with benzodiazepines. Supportive treatment with supplemental O2.
   Would not give diuretics at this point, but would monitor I/O closely.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill due to severe metabolic acidosis.
   Total time: 50 min critical care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and possible ketoacidosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizures: The patient's history of alcohol withdrawal and low sodium levels increase the risk of seizures. Continuous monitoring for seizure activity is essential.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea, low oxygen saturation, and diffuse wheezing indicate compromised respiratory function. Close monitoring and support with supplemental oxygen are necessary.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of hep C cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and neurological symptoms. Monitoring for any changes in neurologic status is crucial.

4. Infection: The presence of pneumonia and bandemia suggests an increased risk of infection. Regular assessment for fever, leukocytosis, and culture results is necessary to manage and prevent further infections.

5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's lab results indicate several electrolyte abnormalities, including low potassium, low magnesium, and low phosphate. These imbalances can have significant effects on cardiac function and muscle strength. Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are essential.

6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia"

   o/e tremulous.  Lungs clear.  CV regular
   A/P:
   ETOH withdraw:  continue valium as per CIWA
   Acidosis:  AG due to likely lactate from ?thiamine deficiency and
   shock from hypoperfusion due to hypovolemia.  Also likely with ketones
   from ETOH.
   COPD: long time smoker, slightly hypoxemia and SOB:  SOB likely also
   due to respiratory compensation of acidosis.  Continue nebs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, and cardiomyopathy. He presents with ethanol intoxication and concern for withdrawal. He has severe metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and chest pressure. The patient's past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, alcohol and hepatitis C cirrhosis, and cardiomyopathy. 

24-hour events include bicarb being uptitrated to 16 with bicarb drip, acidosis improved, oxygen requirement increased, and lipase trending down. The patient received 140 mg IV valium overnight and is on a CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal. 

Physical examination shows the patient to be lethargic, tremulous, tachycardic, tachypneic, with bibasilar rales, diffuse wheezes bilaterally, and moderate abdominal distension. Neurological examination reveals a resting tremor without asterixis. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, moderately low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or not provided. 

Radiology shows new bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and plan include pneumonia, acute renal failure, and alcohol withdrawal.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
   level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Dilated thoracic aorta. No
   structural heart disease or pathologic flow identified.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-1-17**], the
   findings are similar.

   and now intubated, + c. diff infection.
   # ETOH withdrawal: Overnight, patient became hypertensive, agitated,
   tachycardic, had high requirements of valium and was intubated for
   airway protection.  Likely 48 hours from last drink
   - continue propofol gtt
   - thiamin, folate, MVI
   - valium prn
   # Pneumonia: aspiration vs. community acquired.
   - levofloxacin and flagyl x 5 days
   - send sputum culture
   - daily CXR
   # Bandemia: likely in setting of stress and infection.
   - add on diff today
   - continue abx
   # Non-AG acidosis: likely secondary to NS resuscitation. Lactate
   normalized.
   - started D5 1/2 NS
   # ARF: baseline Cr normal.  Much improved after aggressive hydration.
   Una <10. Patient clinically remains dry, despite aggressive IV fluid.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) abuse who presented after being found down and experiencing delirium tremens (DTs). He was intubated and diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient also has symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol, pneumonia (aspiration vs. community-acquired), bandemia (likely in the setting of stress and infection), non-anion gap (NAAG) metabolic acidosis (likely secondary to normal saline resuscitation), acute kidney injury (ARF), dark output from the gastrointestinal tract (possibly stool), rhabdomyolysis (trending down), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), C. difficile infection, smoking addiction, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and hypoglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. ETOH withdrawal: Symptoms may include severe agitation, hallucinations, tremors, seizures, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Pneumonia: Complications may include respiratory failure, sepsis, and systemic infection.
3. Bandemia: It is a sign of infection and can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
4. NAAG metabolic acidosis: If left untreated, it can progress to severe acidosis, affecting organ function, particularly the cardiovascular system.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with persistent acidosis, worsening right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, dark/guaiac positive stool, and symptoms of withdrawal. The patient required rapid escalation of diazepam dose, intubation, and propofol infusion. An echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function, dilated thoracic aorta, and no structural heart disease or pathologic flow identified. The patient is well-nourished, overweight/obese, and has poor dentition. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 81-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/69 to 183/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 4,506 mL and output of 2,440 mL. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 22, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 44, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 235, and Ve of 12.2 L/min. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, endotracheal and NG tube in place, and normal peripheral pulses. Neurologic examination is not assessed. Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.1 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 132 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 26 mg/dL. The patient is on multiple medications including propofol, diazepam, haloperidol, and heparin sodium. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications due to mechanical ventilation and the presence of pneumonia.
2. Cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias due to the patient's history of mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and dilated thoracic aorta.
3. Gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding indicated by the dark/guaiac positive stool.
4. Infection-related complications due to the presence of pneumonia and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Renal complications indicated by the elevated creatinine level, which may be due to acute kidney injury.
6. Neurologic complications due to the patient's withdrawal symptoms and the need for sedation with propofol.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and the use of central venous catheters.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the duration of mechanical ventilation.
9. Medication-related complications such as allergic reactions or adverse effects from the medications being administered."

   Assessment and Plan
   54yoM w/ a h/o ETOH abuse presents after being found down.
   # ETOH withdrawal:
   -thiamine, folate, MVI daily
   -valium 10mg IV q6hrs and CIWA scale
had high Valium requirement since
   admission. Change to po.
   -Has increased O2 req
t with sedation from benzodiazepines.
   # Bandemia: significant bandemia in the setting of severe physiologic
   stress.  Possible RLL infiltrate on CXR and given levofloxacin and
   flagyl in ER.
   -continue levo and flagyl
   -f/u cultures including stool
   -send sputum culture
needs a new specimen
   -culture if spikes, broaden abx if hemodynamically unstable
   #  Anion Gap Acidosis: the patient has a lactic acidosis, in addition
   to an osmolar gap.  Likely related to ETOH related ketoacidosis (+
   ketones in urine) and lactic acidosis.  Patient gives history of ETOH
   intoxication.  Gap now 17.
   -monitor gap acidosis
   -was on bicarb gtt until this morning
making patient hypokalemic.
   -lactate elevation possibly elevated due to hypoperfusion related to
   relative hypotension- normalized after 7 liters of fluid.  Another
   possibility is seizure given ETOH withdrawal.
   # ARF: baseline Cr normal.  Much improved after aggressive hydration.
   Una <10. Patient clinically remains dry, despite aggressive IV fluid.
   Allow patient to drink to thirst and follow clinically,.
   #  Chest pain: ROMI, repeat EKG in a.m. Troponins have been negative,
   but CK elevated (expect low level rhabdo)
    #  COPD: no diagnosis of COPD, no PFTs in system but diffuse wheezing
   and significant smoking history.
   -standing nebulizers with prn. Steroids today.
   -treatment for aspiration PNA
   -Incentive spirometry
   # Hep C cirrhosis: albumin 3.1, but INR normal
   # Nausea: evidence of pancreatitis as well as alcoholic liver disease.
   Trend LFTs, likely also related to extensive electrolyte abnormalities.
   Continue prn zofran. Improved clinically.
   # Diarrhea: send stool culture and c diff.
   # Smoking:  nicotine patch
   #  NSVT: non sustained VT on tele in ER.   Aggressive electrolyte
   monitorinig and repletion. Correcting acidosis and potassium repletion
   (will need to monitor for hyperkalemia off HCO3 gtt as K released again
   from cells). Amiodarone gtt stopped at admission
   -start beta blocker- metoprolol 25mg po bid
   -trend cardiac enzymes as above
   -monitor on tele
   -correct pH
   -discontinue amiodarone- has rec'd bolus dose amiodarone
   -very likely secondary to electrolyte / acid base disturbances
   -echo in a.m.
   # Hypoglycemia:
   -qid fingersticks, allow to eat.
   -unclear cause- possibly related to ETOH and poor PO intake vs.
   advanced liver disease- send INR and PT as above.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after being found down. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has shown persistent acidosis despite aggressive hydration, and there is evidence of lactic acidosis and possible ETOH-related ketoacidosis. The patient's blood glucose levels are low, but they have been improving with oral intake.

The patient has a history of COPD, but no formal diagnosis or pulmonary function tests are available. There is evidence of alcoholic liver disease and pancreatitis. The patient is also showing signs of withdrawal from alcohol, requiring rapid escalation of diazepam to control symptoms.

The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening right lower lobe infiltrate, indicating a possible pneumonia. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started empirically. The patient's heart function appears to be preserved, but there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, further deterioration in liver function, development of sepsis, and potential complications from alcohol withdrawal. Close monitoring and management of these issues will be crucial for the patient's well-being."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The key points from the note are as follows:

- The patient is experiencing ETOH (ethanol) withdrawal and severe metabolic acidosis.
- Overnight, the patient's withdrawal symptoms increased, leading to hypoxemia, and required 150mg of oxygen over two hours. The patient was subsequently intubated and is stable on propofol.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown angioedema with enalapril.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including propofol, haloperidol (Haldol), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), pantoprazole (Protonix), diazepam (Valium), lopressor, levofloxacin, thiamine, folate, nicotine, medrol, albuterol, flagyl, and others.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 79-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/78 to 183/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an adequate fluid balance.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.28, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after being found unconscious and experiencing delirium tremens. He was intubated for airway protection and has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, pneumonia (aspiration vs. community-acquired), bandemia, non-anion gap (NAG) metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), dark output, rhabdomyolysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and nicotine dependence. The patient's condition has improved with aggressive hydration but remains oliguric. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient is already diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and may require additional treatment or surgical intervention if severe.
3. ARF: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
4. Dark OGT output/stool: The dark output may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a serious complication requiring immediate attention.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK levels indicate rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney damage and other systemic complications.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient has COPD, and any exacerbation can lead"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after being found down, experiencing delirium tremens, and now intubated with a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has been diagnosed with ethanol withdrawal, pneumonia (aspiration vs. community-acquired), bandemia, acute renal failure (resolved), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), C. difficile infection, smoking, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms such as agitation, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, and delirium.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may develop respiratory distress, increased fever, worsening oxygenation, and signs of sepsis.
3. Bandemia: The patient may exhibit signs of infection, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, and increased risk of sepsis.
4. Acute renal failure (resolved): Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, there is a risk of its recurrence, especially if the patient develops further complications or if the underlying cause returns.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient may experience worsening respiratory symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, coughing, and sputum production.
6. C. difficile infection: The patient may develop diarrhea, abdominal pain, and an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with an unknown allergy to penicillins and a history of angioedema related to enalapril. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and has been in the ICU since [**2124-5-10**]. The patient has had multiple changes in medication and medical interventions, including propofol infusion for sedation, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis.

Vital signs show a blood pressure of 150/91 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 40%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain. The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, endotracheal tube, NG tube, and no acute distress. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated blood glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found down and is now intubated due to delirium tremens (DTs) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's medical conditions include ethanol withdrawal, pneumonia, acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), C. diff infection, smoking, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 153/93 to 141/81 mmHg, heart rate between 87-109 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and intubated.

The patient has been receiving various medications including valium, heparin sodium, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and diazepam. He has also been given IV fluids and antibiotics for his infections.

The patient's lab results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. Kidney function appears to be within normal limits based on creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Electrolyte levels are also within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, an endotracheal tube, and a nasogastric tube. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found down and presented with delirium tremens (DTs) and is now intubated. He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, pneumonia (possibly aspiration or community-acquired), ethanol withdrawal, acute respiratory failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and nicotine dependence. The patient's condition has improved with treatment, including antibiotics, diuretics, and supportive care. However, he remains critically ill and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which could be due to aspiration or community-acquired causes. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection with continued administration of metronidazole. Close monitoring for worsening symptoms or complications related to the infection is necessary.
3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and presentation with DTs indicate the need for continued management of ethanol withdrawal symptoms. Weaning off propofol and restarting valium when awake may be considered.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's initial labs show elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential acute kidney injury. Monitoring renal function and appropriate management, such as diuretics, should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, who presented after being found unconscious and now intubated. He was diagnosed with delirium tremens (DTs) and a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has multiple medical complications including ethanol withdrawal, pneumonia, bandemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), C. diff infection, smoking addiction, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms such as agitation, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, and delirium. Close monitoring of vital signs and neurological status is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may develop worsening respiratory symptoms, increased sputum production, fever, and difficulty breathing. Regular chest X-rays and sputum cultures should be done to monitor the infection.
3. Bandemia: This indicates an increased number of bands on the complete blood count (CBC). It can be associated with infection or inflammation. Monitoring of the CBC trends is important.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient may show signs of decreased urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function tests is necessary.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after being found down, experiencing delirium tremens (DTs), and is now intubated. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient is being treated for ETOH withdrawal with thiamine, folate, and mechanical ventilation (MV). Proprol and valium are given as needed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient may have pneumonia due to aspiration or community-acquired infection. He is receiving levofloxacin and metronidazole for 5 days, and follow-up sputum culture is planned. Broad-spectrum coverage with boaden is considered if there is clinical worsening.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection: The patient has a C. difficile infection, for which he will continue receiving Flagyl for 14 days.

4. Respiratory support: The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The respiratory system is stable with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 40 and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

5. Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,448 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an intake of 689 mL orally and 2,268 mL intravenously. The output includes 30 mL through the peritoneal dialysis (TF), 2,268 mL intravenously, and 4,400 mL through the urine. There is a negative fluid balance of 2,152 mL.

6. Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 101.8°F, heart rate is 97 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure is 157/87 mmHg, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute (insp/min), and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient is sedated and not following commands.

7. Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range. Other lab values such as hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), blood glucose, electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-), and liver function tests (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, T Bili) are mostly within normal limits.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after being found down and experiencing delirium tremens (DTs). He is currently intubated and has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection. The patient's current medical conditions include ethanol withdrawal, pneumonia, bandemia (likely due to stress and infection), acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), C. difficile infection, smoking cessation support, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and hypoglycemia.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.8°F, elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate, and respiratory rate within normal limits. His oxygen saturation is 99% on supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,448 mL and output of 4,600 mL, with a negative balance of -2,152 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and extremities with 1+ pulses. Neurological assessment shows sedation and non-purposeful movement.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of ethanol withdrawal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting after being found unconscious with delirium tremens (DTs) and now intubated due to a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has several medical conditions, including ethanol withdrawal, pneumonia (aspiration vs. community acquired), acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), C. diff infection, and nicotine dependence.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient is at risk for complications associated with alcohol withdrawal, such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may develop further respiratory complications, such as worsening lung infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to aspiration or community-acquired factors.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): There is a risk of recurrent ARF or progression to chronic kidney disease if the underlying cause is not appropriately managed.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient may experience exacerbations of COPD, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
5. C. difficile infection: There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the infection, which can lead to severe colitis and sepsis.
6. Nicotine dependence: The patient may experience withdrawal symptoms from nicotine dependence, which can contribute to agitation and other psychological disturbances.

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse who presented after being found down, experiencing delirium tremens (DTs) and is now intubated. The patient has a current Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection and was diuresed with lasix yesterday. An unsuccessful attempt was made at bedside to place a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient had an 11-beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) this morning, which was asymptomatic and spontaneously resolved.

The patient's allergies include penicillins and unknown agents, as well as angioedema with enalapril. The patient received antibiotics, specifically levofloxacin and metronidazole, within the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (lasix), fentanyl, metoprolol, nicotine patch, aspirin, propofol, albuterol, ipratropium, Peridex, valium, thiamine, and folate.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events above. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found down and is currently intubated due to delirium tremens (DTs). The patient also has a Clostridium difficile infection and is being treated with metronidazole. 

24-hour events include unsuccessful PICC attempt, a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), diuresis with lasix, and decreased secretions with scopolamine. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/85 mmHg to 103/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 415 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. Electrolytes are within normal range except for slightly low potassium. Chest X-ray shows possible right lower lobe and middle lobe infiltrates.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found down and now intubated. He presents with delirium tremens (DTs) and a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's current medical conditions include ethanol withdrawal, pneumonia, acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a C. difficile infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms such as agitation, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, and delirium. Close monitoring is necessary after extubation.

2. Pneumonia: Aspiration pneumonia is a concern due to the patient's ability to swallow pills but likely aspirating chronically. Community-acquired pneumonia cannot be ruled out either. Treatment includes antibiotics, such as levofloxacin and flagyl, and daily chest X-rays.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible acute renal failure. Diuretics, such as Lasix, are being used to attempt diuresis and achieve a negative fluid balance.

4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has COPD, and nebulizers on the ventilator are being used for respiratory support.

5. C. difficile infection: The patient has a current C. difficile infection, and treatment"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight, anxious, and diaphoretic individual who was recently extubated after invasive ventilation. The patient's mental status is confused, and there are concerns about Korsakoff syndrome. The patient has hypernatremia and is being given increased free water. Levofloxacin was discontinued, and the patient is at risk for chronic aspiration. There is ongoing monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and angioedema related to enalapril. The patient's medical and family history is unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Compromise: The patient has an inability to protect their airway, which increases the risk of aspiration and impaired airway clearance.
2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient is diagnosed with acute systolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload and respiratory distress.
3. Pneumonia: There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's inability to protect their airway.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can be caused by factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or dehydration.
5. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol use, there is a risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens and seizures.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The note indicates that the patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. However, the patient is showing signs of confusion and may have Korsakoff syndrome. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and enalapril, which caused angioedema. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, pantoprazole, furosemide, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and diazepam.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/91 to 194/104 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 91%.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total input of 1,851 mL and output of 3,165 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,314 mL. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 415 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 3%.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of sodium (141 mEq/L), glucose (132 mg/dL), and white blood cell count (5.1 K/uL). The platelet count is within normal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after being found unconscious. He was initially intubated due to delirium tremens (DTs) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection. The patient has since been extubated and is currently agitated with confused mental status, possibly exhibiting signs of Korsakoff syndrome. He has a history of ethanol withdrawal, pneumonia, acute kidney injury (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 140/91 to 180/104 mmHg, heart rate between 86-87 bpm, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, low platelet count, increased creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is currently receiving various medications including fentanyl, pantoprazole, lasix, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and diazepam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's ability to swallow pills but likely aspirating chronically increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Delirium: The patient's agitated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital after being found unresponsive. He was diagnosed with delirium tremens (DTs) and a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient is currently extubated and receiving invasive ventilation, but it has been stopped. He has been started on IV fluids and lasix for hypernatremia. Levofloxacin was discontinued, and he will undergo speech and swallow evaluation before resuming oral intake. The patient's mental status is still confused, and there are concerns about possible Korsakoff syndrome. Physical examination reveals well-nourished and overweight appearance, poor dentition, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as hyponatremia and hypokalemia. The patient's electrolyte imbalances are being aggressively managed. His white blood cell count is slightly low, hematocrit is within normal range, and platelet count is also within normal range. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes and troponin levels. The patient has multiple medical complications including ethanol withdrawal, pneumonia (aspiration vs. community-acquired), C. difficile infection, acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking cessation support, and nonsust"

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found down and presented with delirium tremens (DTs) and a Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection. The patient has been extubated after invasive ventilation and is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). He has mental status confusion and may have Korsakoff syndrome. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/91 to 103/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is able to swallow pills but likely aspirates chronically. Fluid balance shows a deficit of 1.3 liters. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, C. difficile infection, acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), nicotine dependence, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). He is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antacids, diuretics, beta-blockers, and antipsychotics. The patient's laboratory results indicate electrolyte imbalances, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is being managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, nutritional support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a chief complaint of ETOH withdrawal, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday and is doing well but still confused at times. 

The patient has been experiencing several medical conditions and complications. He has ETOH withdrawal, which is being managed by stopping standing Valium and administering it as needed based on the CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol) scale. The patient also has altered mental status, which could be due to Korsakoff's syndrome or ICU delirium/Valium effect. His mental status is slowly improving.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and is being treated with Flagyl. He also has pneumonia (PNA) and is receiving treatment with levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/94 mmHg to 110/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. However, his creatinine level is elevated at 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate mild abnormalities in electrolyte levels, liver function tests, kidney function, and cardiac enzymes."

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after being found down and experiencing delirium tremens (DTs) along with Clostridium difficile infection. He required large doses of IV valium initially but is now extubated, sitting well, and taking PO valium. He will be transitioning to CIWA q4H, continuing thiamine, folate, and MVI.

The patient also has pneumonia, which could be aspiration-related or community-acquired. He has completed levofloxacin for 5 days on [**2124-5-13**] and will follow up with a sputum culture. He is now off supplemental O2, on aspiration precautions, and NPO pending speech and swallow evaluation hopefully tomorrow.

The patient has resolved acute renal failure (ARF) and is diuresing well with 10 mg IV Lasix doses. He is also being given [**Hospital1 **] lytes with diuresis, including phosphorus. He has COPD and is receiving nebs on the vent but is off steroids. He is using a nicotine patch for smoking cessation.

The patient had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on telemetry in the ER but it has not been an issue in the ICU. He will discontinue telemetry on transfer to the floor. His electrolyte abnormalities were in the setting of alcohol withdrawal and will be aggressively managed. He"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has been receiving intermittent hemodialysis, but it has been a concern that his electrolytes and fluid balance have not been managed adequately. He was switched back to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) this evening. The patient's medications include methadone, which is being weaned down to 10 mg, and low-dose haloperidol for agitation. He has been diagnosed with a segmental pulmonary embolism and started on heparin. His anemia labs show low iron levels, elevated ferritin, and low reticulocyte count, indicating possible iron deficiency anemia, for which he has been started on iron supplementation. The patient also had a fever overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored due to concerns about inadequate management of electrolytes and fluid balance.
2. Fluid overload: The patient may be at risk of fluid overload due to inadequate fluid management.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and recent history of aspiration pneumonia suggest an increased risk of infection.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients.
5. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and risk factors, there is a potential risk of developing sepsis.

   54 y.o. M w/ a h/o EtOH abuse presents after being found down, c/b DTs
   and + C. diff infection.
   ETOH withdrawal: Initially required very large doses of IV valium and
   course complicated by intubation.  Now extubated, satting well and
   taking PO valium.  Agitation may have component from underlying psych
   issue; did respond to haldol 2.5mg IV.
   - Continue CIWA scale q4H
   - Increase haldol to standing dose
   - continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   Pneumonia: aspiration vs. community acquired.
   - Completed levofloxacin x 5 days on [**2124-5-13**]
   - now off supplemental O2
   - aspiration precautions
   - currently NPO with the exception of valium pending speech and swallow
   evaluation hopefully tomorrow; will need placement of NG tube
   C. difficile infection:
   - continue flagyl x 14 days ([**2124-5-24**])
   ARF: resolved and diuresing well. Last dose lasix on [**5-14**].
   - Allow pt to autodiurese
   COPD: Nebs on the vent. Off Steroids
   Smoking:  nicotine patch
   NSVT: non sustained VT on tele in ER.  Has not been an issue in the
   ICU.
   - beta blocker, echo w/o significant structural abnormality, was in the
   setting of electrolyte abnormalities
   - Replete lytes aggressively

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with delirium tremens and a Clostridium difficile infection. He required intubation due to severe agitation and is now extubated, oxygenating well on room air. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly aspiration versus community-acquired, and is currently on levofloxacin. He is also being treated for chronic alcohol withdrawal with CIWA scale monitoring, increased haloperidol, thiamine, folate, and MVI. The patient has resolved acute renal failure and is diuresing well. He has a history of COPD and is receiving nebs while on the ventilator. Smoking cessation is being addressed with a nicotine patch. The patient had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the ER but has not experienced any issues in the ICU. It is recommended to continue beta-blocker therapy, perform an echo to rule out structural abnormalities, and address electrolyte imbalances. The patient's glycemic control is well-managed, and he is NPO pending speech and swallow evaluation. An NG tube may be placed soon. The patient has DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP precautions. Restraints are reviewed as needed. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the floor once his monitoring needs are met."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with delirium tremens and a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for continued alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, due to his history of ETOH abuse.

2. Aspiration: The patient has an impaired ability to protect his airway, putting him at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

3. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: The patient may have acute heart failure due to electrolyte and fluid disorders.

4. Pneumonia: The patient may have community-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. This is suggested by the sparse growth of gram-negative rods in the respiratory culture.

5. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient may have acute renal failure, which has resolved but could potentially recur.

6. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has a current C. difficile infection, for which he is being treated with flagyl.

   and + C. diff infection.
   ETOH withdrawal: Initially required very large doses of IV valium and
   course complicated by intubation.  Now extubated, satting well and
   taking PO valium.  Agitation may have component from underlying psych
   issue; does respond to haldol 2.5mg IV.
   - Continue CIWA scale q4H with IV ativan
   - continue scheduled haldol
   - Increase haldol to standing dose
   - continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   Aspiration risk: Patient presented with aspiration pna vs. community
   acquired Pneumonia. Per S&S, patient aspirating ->Placed NG tube but
   patient pulled it out shortly after placement.
   - Completed levofloxacin x 5 days on [**2124-5-13**]
   - now off supplemental O2
   - aspiration precautions
   - currently NPO pending speech and swallow re-evaluation hopefully
   tomorrow.
   C. difficile infection:
   - continue flagyl x 14 days ([**2124-5-24**])
   ARF: resolved and diuresing well. Last dose lasix on [**5-14**].
   - Pt has been autodiuresing
   COPD: Off Steroids
   Smoking:  nicotine patch
   NSVT: non sustained VT on tele in ER.  Has not been an issue in the
   ICU.
   - beta blocker, echo w/o significant structural abnormality, was in the
   setting of electrolyte abnormalities
   - Replete lytes aggressively

   and + C. diff infection.
   ETOH withdrawal: Initially required very large doses of IV valium and
   course complicated by intubation.  Now extubated, satting well and
   taking PO valium.  Agitation may have component from underlying psych
   issue; does respond to haldol 2.5mg IV.
   - Continue CIWA scale q4H with IV ativan
   - continue scheduled haldol
   - Increase haldol to standing dose
   - continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   Aspiration risk: Patient presented with aspiration pna vs. community
   acquired Pneumonia. Per S&S, patient aspirating ->Placed NG tube but
   patient pulled it out shortly after placement.
   - Completed levofloxacin x 5 days on [**2124-5-13**]
   - now off supplemental O2
   - aspiration precautions
   - currently NPO pending speech and swallow re-evaluation hopefully
   tomorrow.
   C. difficile infection:
   - continue flagyl x 14 days ([**2124-5-24**])
   ARF: resolved and diuresing well. Last dose lasix on [**5-14**].
   - Allow pt to autodiurese
   COPD: Nebs on the vent. Off Steroids
   Smoking:  nicotine patch
   NSVT: non sustained VT on tele in ER.  Has not been an issue in the
   ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU after being found unconscious and experiencing delirium tremens (DTs) and a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient required intubation due to severe withdrawal symptoms but has now been extubated and is able to take oral medications. He is still experiencing agitation, which responds to haloperidol (Haldol) administration.

Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient initially required large doses of IV valium for ethanol withdrawal symptoms and was intubated. Although he is now extubated, he still exhibits agitation, indicating ongoing withdrawal effects.
2. C. difficile Infection: The patient has an active C. difficile infection, for which he is being treated with flagyl.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia versus community-acquired pneumonia. Due to the risk of aspiration, a nasogastric (NG) tube was placed, but the patient removed it shortly after.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF has resolved, and he is diuresing well. He was last given a dose of lasix on [**5-14**].
5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has COPD and received nebulizer treatments while on mechanical ventilation. He is currently off steroids and using a nicotine patch"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with delirium tremens (DTs) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He required intubation due to complications from ETOH withdrawal but is now extubated and able to take oral medications. The patient has a history of COPD, acute renal failure (ARF), and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). His current conditions include agitation managed with haloperidol, aspiration pneumonia versus community-acquired pneumonia, resolved ARF, and C. difficile infection. The patient is currently NPO pending a speech and swallow evaluation. He is on a nicotine patch for smoking cessation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has an increased risk of aspiration due to his underlying condition, which could lead to recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has an active C. difficile infection, which may worsen if appropriate antibiotics are not continued or if the infection spreads to other parts of the body.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: Although the patient has received treatment for alcohol withdrawal, there is still a risk of recurrent withdrawal symptoms or complications.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and his current respiratory status may be compromised due to recent intubation and potential aspiration events. This increases the risk of COPD exacerbation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found unconscious and diagnosed with delirium tremens (DTs) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He was intubated due to agitation but is now extubated and stable. The patient's agitation is likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy rather than alcohol withdrawal, although he is still receiving frequent lorazepam. He is being weaned off lorazepam and continues to receive scheduled haloperidol for agitation. A psychiatric consultation has been ordered.

The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia versus community-acquired pneumonia. An NG tube was placed but the patient pulled it out. He completed a course of levofloxacin and is now off supplemental oxygen. Aspiration precautions are in place, and speech and swallow evaluation is pending as the patient is currently NPO.

The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved, and he is diuresing well after the last dose of lasix on [**5-14**]. He has been autodiuresing. His chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is off steroids, and he is using nicotine patches. He had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on telemetry in the emergency room, but it has not been an issue in the ICU. It is recommended to replete electrolytes aggressively and discontinue telemetry on"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse who was found down and presented with delirium tremens (DTs) and a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has had multiple medical complications.

1. Agitation: The patient initially presented with EtOH withdrawal but is now likely experiencing toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. The recommended treatment includes discontinuing Ativan, continuing scheduled Haloperidol with prn doses, and using Xyprexa SL for agitation.

2. Aspiration risk: The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia versus community-acquired pneumonia. Due to the high risk of aspiration, a nasogastric (NG) tube was placed, but the patient removed it shortly after placement. It is advised to continue aspiration precautions and re-evaluate the patient's speech and swallow function.

3. C. difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with a C. difficile infection and is currently receiving Flagyl. The treatment plan includes continuing Flagyl for an additional 14 days until [**2124-5-24**].

   Assessment and Plan
   54 y.o. M w/ a h/o EtOH abuse presents after being found down, c/b DTs
   and + C. diff infection.
   Agitation: Initially with EtOH withdrawal which required very large
   doses of IV valium and course complicated by intubation.  Now
   extubated, satting well and taking PO valium.  Likely not in EtOH
   withdrawal anymore although still receiving frequent ativan; agitation
   likely with large component from underlying toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   - Halve ativan CIWA scale to avoid withdrawal
   - continue scheduled haldol with prn doses of haldol, xyprexa SL for
   agitation
   - Psych consult
   - D/c thiamine, folate, MVI as NPO and has already received several
   doses
   Aspiration risk: Patient presented with aspiration pna vs. community
   acquired Pneumonia. Per S&S, patient aspirating ->Placed NG tube but
   patient pulled it out shortly after placement.
   - Completed levofloxacin x 5 days on [**2124-5-13**]
   - now off supplemental O2
   - aspiration precautions
   - currently NPO, will ask speech and swallow to re-evaluate
   C. difficile infection:
   - continue flagyl x 14 days ([**2124-5-24**])
   ARF: resolved and diuresing well. Last dose lasix on [**5-14**].
   - Pt has been autodiuresing
   COPD: Off Steroids
   Smoking:  Nicotine patch
   NSVT: non sustained VT on tele in ER.  Has not been an issue in the
   ICU.
   - beta blocker, echo w/o significant structural abnormality, was in the

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents after being found down with delirium tremens (DTs) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He was initially agitated and required large doses of intravenous valium due to ethanol withdrawal, but now he is extubated, oxygenating well, and taking oral valium. It is likely that he is no longer in ethanol withdrawal, but his agitation may be due to underlying toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 141/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia versus community-acquired pneumonia, and he has already had an NG tube placed, but it was removed by the patient. He is currently on aspiration precautions, off supplemental oxygen, and nothing by mouth (NPO).

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), which has resolved and he is diuresing well. He was previously on lasix, but is now autodiuresing. Additionally, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for which he is no longer on steroids and is being treated with a nicotine patch.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after being found down and experiencing delirium tremens (DTs) and a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's agitation is likely due to a combination of factors including EtOH withdrawal and toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. The patient has been treated with various medications such as Ativan, Haldol, and Zyprexa SL for agitation, as well as thiamine, folate, and multivitamins.

The patient's respiratory status has been a concern, initially requiring intubation due to severe agitation but is now extubated and oxygenating well on room air. An NG tube was placed to prevent aspiration but was pulled out shortly after placement. Aspiration precautions are being taken, and a video swallow study is planned.

The patient's renal function has resolved, and he is diuresing well. He is also being treated for a C. difficile infection with continued Flagyl therapy. The patient's COPD is currently off steroids, and he is receiving a nicotine patch for smoking cessation.

Other medical complications mentioned in the note include non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which was observed on telemetry in the ER but has not been an issue in the ICU. The patient's electrolyte abnormalities have been addressed, and he will discontinue telemetry on transfer to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old individual with a history of alcohol withdrawal, ongoing delirium, and agitation despite being past the window for withdrawal. The patient required intramuscular haloperidol for agitation and a femoral line. The patient has allergies to penicillins, unknown intra-enalapril, and angioedema. They have received various ICU medications including lorazepam, hydralazine, haloperidol, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for psychiatric/sleep disturbances due to agitation. Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature within normal range, heart rate within normal limits, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and blood pressure within normal range. Oxygen saturation is at 94%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. Lab results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, and calcium levels. However, there are slight variations in other lab values such as TCO2, PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, amylase/lipase, LDH"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, which indicates delirium or confusion. This can be caused by various factors such as electrolyte imbalances, infections, or drug interactions.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, although it is described as benign in this context. It is important to monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent complications related to high blood pressure.

3. Aerobic Capacity/Endurance, Impaired: The patient has impaired aerobic capacity and endurance. This could be due to the patient's overall health condition, age, or previous medical history. Physical therapy and exercise programs may be necessary to improve these functions.

4. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient has an increased risk of aspiration due to impaired gag reflex and airway clearance. This increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.

5. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: The patient is at risk for acute systolic heart failure. This can be caused by factors such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

6. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient has had an episode of aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory complications and infections.

7. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient has experienced acute renal failure,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after being found down and experiencing delirium tremens (DTs) along with a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's agitation was initially attributed to alcohol withdrawal but is now believed to be caused by toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. He has shown significant improvement on scheduled Haloperidol (Haldol).

The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and is now off supplemental oxygen. He has been started on a regular diet with thin liquids. The patient has an allergy to penicillins and intra-enalapril, which caused angioedema. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/71 mmHg to 158/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The respiratory examination shows frequent coughing but clear chest sounds. The abdominal examination is unremarkable. Extremities are warm and well perfused with 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels. Other lab"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after being found unconscious. He was diagnosed with delirium tremens (DTs) and a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient required intubation but is now extubated and is maintaining oxygen saturation. His agitation has improved with scheduled haloperidol (Haldol) doses. The patient's aspiration pneumonia has resolved, and he has completed a course of levofloxacin. He is currently on a regular diet and is off supplemental oxygen. The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved, and he is autodiuresing well. He has a history of COPD and is currently not on steroids. He is also a smoker and is using a nicotine patch for smoking cessation. The patient had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in the emergency room but has not experienced any issues in the ICU. He will discontinue telemetry on transfer to the floor. The patient's electrolyte abnormalities have been addressed, and he will continue to be monitored for any potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and was initially diagnosed with DTs. Although his agitation has improved, there is still a risk of withdrawal symptoms if he is not closely monitored.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient was diagnosed with a C. difficile infection, and he is being treated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse who presented with delirium tremens (DTs) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's main medical complications and potential complications include:

1. Agitation: The patient initially experienced agitation due to ethanol withdrawal, which required large doses of IV valium. The patient is currently on scheduled haloperidol (Haldol) and may require additional doses for agitation. There is a risk of withdrawal symptoms if the patient is discontinued from ativan.

2. Aspiration risk: The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia versus community-acquired pneumonia. Initially, there were signs of aspiration, leading to the placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube. However, the patient pulled out the NG tube, and subsequent video swallow study showed no signs of aspiration. The patient completed a course of levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia and is now on a regular diet with oral medications.

3. C. difficile infection: The patient has an ongoing C. difficile infection and will continue taking flagyl for an additional 14 days until [**2124-5-24**].

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF has resolved, and he is diuresing well after receiving a last dose of lasix on [**5-14**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with delirium, hypertension, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, gait, knowledge, motor function, and transfers. The patient also has a history of electrolyte and fluid disorder, risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, inability to protect airway, acute systolic heart failure, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's impaired arousal, attention, and cognition can increase the risk of falls, injuries, and complications related to medication administration.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
3. Impaired Aerobic Capacity/Endurance: This could result in reduced physical functioning and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.
4. Impaired Balance, Gait, Knowledge, Motor Function, and Transfers: These impairments can increase the risk of falls, injuries, and difficulty with activities of daily living.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: Imbalances in electrolytes and fluids can affect various bodily functions, including heart rhythm, muscle function, and kidney health.
6. Risk for Aspiration: Due to the inability to protect the airway and altered gag reflex, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia.
7. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure can lead to fluid accumulation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was found down and presented with aspiration pneumonia, delirium tremens, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's agitation was initially thought to be due to ethanol withdrawal but is now believed to be toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. He has shown improvement with scheduled doses of haloperidol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has already been treated with levofloxacin for this condition. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and provide appropriate care to prevent further respiratory infections.
2. Delirium tremens (DTs): This condition is associated with alcohol withdrawal. Although the patient's agitation has improved with haloperidol, it is crucial to continue monitoring for any signs of withdrawal and provide supportive care.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is currently on Flagyl for this infection, which needs to be completed as per the prescribed duration. Monitoring for any worsening of symptoms and ensuring proper infection control measures should be maintained.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF has resolved, and he has responded well to diuretics. Encouraging oral fluid intake is recommended, and if necessary, intravenous fluid administration should be considered.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is on prophylactic stress ulcer treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Monitoring for any signs of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after being found unresponsive with delirium tremens and a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has shown improvement over time, including passing a video swallow test, starting on a regular diet, and having controlled agitation with Haldol. The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia that resolved with scheduled beta-blocker administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and initial presentation with delirium tremens suggest a risk for ethanol withdrawal. This can lead to severe symptoms such as agitation, tremors, seizures, and hallucinations.
2. C. difficile Infection: The patient was diagnosed with a Clostridium difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. Complications may include sepsis, toxic megacolon, and perforation.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with aspiration pneumonia versus community-acquired pneumonia. Aspiration can lead to respiratory distress and lung infections.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient had acute kidney injury that resolved with diuresis. ARF can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and renal replacement therapy.
5. IV Access Complications: The patient currently has a right femoral line and an ordered PICC line. Complications with IV access can include"
