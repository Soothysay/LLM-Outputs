","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), pacemaker, and dementia. She was admitted for hypoxia and has known ILD with poor reserve. The patient is not a candidate for aggressive treatment. She is currently experiencing exacerbated diastolic heart failure in the setting of fluid repletion post CT scan. She is on 70% O2 by facemask and being monitored for oxygen saturation, aiming to wean off oxygen as tolerated with a goal of 88-93%. The plan includes Lasix IV to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1 L, daily PO lasix, captopril at a low dose, Prednisone and Plaquenil for RA, Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, holding oxycodone due to somnolence and hypoxia related to spinal stenosis, PPI for prophylaxis, SC Heparin for DVT prophylaxis, bowel regimen, NPO with plans to correct/replete electrolytes as needed, PIVs for access, DNR/DNI code status, and disposition pending rehab screening.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's known ILD with poor reserve may worsen due to diastolic heart failure and fluid repletion.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), pacemaker, and dementia. She was admitted for hypoxia and is currently on 70% oxygen by facemask. The patient has been diagnosed with diastolic heart failure and is being treated with intravenous fluids (IVF) therapy following a cardiac event.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 78 bpm with a range of 74-78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/49-141/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with a range of 21-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is atrial flutter.

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 29.9%, platelet count of 295 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 97 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of <0.01. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

   24 Hour Events:
   Please see prior MICU admission notes as patient is well-known to the
   ICU service. Briefly, this is a 79 y.o. female with a history of ILD in
   the setting of RA, on steroids and not a candidate for more aggressive
   treatment, also with diastolic CHF, repeatedly admitted to the ICU with
   hypoxia. Patient was called out from the MICU on [**4-10**] after resolution
   of hypoxia with diuresis and was doing well, on nasal cannula. She went
   for a CTA chest which showed no PE and was given IVF afterwards (total
   of 800ccs) and approximately 6 hours later developed increasing oxygen
   requirement with a maximum of 6 L NC and concomitant 50% shovel mask,
   with oxygen saturation in the low 90s resulting in a trigger. ABG
   revealed: 7.49/43/63/34. CXR was largely unchanged from prior. She was
   given 40 mg of IV Lasix (in addition to 40 earlier in the day) with
   approximately 400 ccs of UOP, but no change in oxygenation. There was
   inconsistency between pulse ox on the finger vs. the forehead and
   patient did have finger nail polish which was felt to be possibly
   affecting pulse ox, so the forehead probe was used which showed higher
   readings in the mid 90s. Still, patient was unable to be weaned down
   from shovel mask. Thus, she was transferred back to the MICU for
   further management. Of note, patient displayed aggressive behavior
   again and received a total of 1.5 mg of Haldol. Upon evaluation by the
   MICU team, she was resting comfortably, but arousable.

   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F h/o ILD (normal O2 sat at baseline), RA, atrial flutter, CHF,
   pacemaker, dementia admitted for hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient has known, ILD with poor reserve. She is not felt to
   be a candidate for more aggressive treatment. Moreover, it is not felt
   that her recurrent decompensations are due to her ILD as there is no
   reason for a chronic disease of this nature to so readily decompensate.
   The current thought has been that patient is having recurrent episodes
   of pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic dysfunction confirmed on
   most recent echo. This episode likely exacerbant was IVF s/p CTA. CTA
   ruled out PE and there is no suggestion of pulmonary infection. Patient
   had been diuresed, but could not be weaned down on O2 and though her
   ABG was not largely changed from prior, she was on a much more
   significant amount of oxygen than prior, suggesting an increased
   gradient. Given that diuresis did not work, patient was transferred to
   the ICU for possible BiPAP.
   - Continue to monitor oxygen saturation and wean as tolerated with O2
     goal of 88-93%. Can use BiPAP as an adjunct to wean
   - Though etiology today seems clear, consider TTE with bubbles to  rule
   out shunt

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and required supplemental oxygen. A CT angiography (CTA) ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE), and the patient received intravenous fluids (IVF) after the CTA. However, she developed increasing oxygen requirements and was transferred back to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has known ILD with poor reserve and recurrent episodes of hypoxia. The current episode may be due to pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic dysfunction, confirmed on most recent echocardiogram (echo).
2. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, which can lead to pulmonary edema and subsequent hypoxia.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause inadequate blood flow to the lungs and subsequent hypoxia.
4. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): The patient's RA may contribute to her overall condition and could potentially affect lung function.
5. Medication Side Effects: Some medications the patient is taking, such as steroids, may have side effects that can impact her respiratory status"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), pacemaker, and dementia. The patient was admitted for hypoxia and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications including Lasix for fluid management, risperidone and haloperidol for agitation, and heparin sodium as a prophylactic measure.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 134/65 to 139/72 mmHg, heart rate between 60 and 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is also on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool device.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal cardiovascular findings and peripheral pulses. There are crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and extremities with edema. Neurological assessment is not available due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Blood glucose levels are relatively stable. Other lab values such as creatinine, troponin T, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of oxygen saturation, weaning of oxygen as tolerated,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a chief complaint of fall. She has a history of heart failure (diastolic), dementia (including Alzheimer's), and chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

24-hour events include administration of Lasix 40 mg IV, risperidone qHS and prn, and haldol x 1 for agitation. The patient was also screened for hospital rehabilitation and placed on NPO status due to speech and swallowing difficulties.

Vital signs show a stable temperature within normal range, slightly elevated blood pressure, and normal heart rate. Respiratory rate is mildly increased, and oxygen saturation is within normal limits. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool device and has an ABG result of ///31.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils, symmetric chest expansion, and crackles in the lungs. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show mild edema in both legs. Skin assessment is not performed, and neurologic examination is incomplete.

Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Troponin-T is below the detection limit, glucose levels are within normal range, and other lab values are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes interstitial lung disease, falls, heart failure (diastolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F h/o ILD (normal O2 sat at baseline), RA, atrial flutter, CHF,
   pacemaker, dementia admitted for hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient has known, ILD with poor reserve. She is not felt to
   be a candidate for more aggressive treatment. Moreover, it is not felt
   that her recurrent decompensations are due to her ILD as there is no
   reason for a chronic disease of this nature to so readily decompensate.
   The current thought has been that patient is having recurrent episodes
   of pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic dysfunction confirmed on
   most recent echo. Today's likely exacerbant was IVF s/p CTA. CTA ruled
   out PE and there is no suggestion of pulmonary infection. Patient had
   been diuresed, but could not be weaned down on O2 and though her ABG
   was not largely changed from prior, she was on a much more significant
   amount of oxygen than prior, suggesting an increased gradient. Given
   that diuresis did not work, patient was transferred to the ICU for
   possible BiPAP.
   - Continue to monitor oxygen saturation and wean as tolerated with O2
     goal of 88-93%. Can use BiPAP as an adjunct to wean
   - Though etiology today seems clear, consider TTE with bubbles to
     rule out shunt
   - Continue daily Lasix

   # RA
   - Continue Prednisone and Plaquenil

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), RA-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation/flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), and dementia. She was admitted for hypoxia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/44 to 137/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is being monitored for hypoxia, agitation, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial flutter/fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and spinal stenosis. She is receiving various medications and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of CHF and current symptoms may indicate the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can worsen her respiratory function and overall condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: Due to the patient's poor pulmonary reserve, hypoxia, and potential pulmonary edema, there is a risk of respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation support.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and underlying risk factors increase the likelihood of DVT formation, leading to potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.
4. Stress Ulcer: Critical illness and medications can predispose the patient to stress"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mrs. [Last Name] is a 79-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), RA-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation/flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), and dementia admitted for hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing atrial flutter with a decreased heart rate, low oxygen saturation, and fluid overload. She is currently on various medications including Omeprazole, Heparin sodium, and Furosemide (Lasix). The patient's vital signs are stable, but her respiratory support is still required. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's renal function is normal, and her liver enzymes are within normal limits. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and reliance on respiratory support indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and appropriate adjustment of oxygen therapy and ventilation support are necessary.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative value, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening of her respiratory status. Monitoring fluid intake and output, and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed, is crucial.
3. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), RA-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD), atrial fibrillation/flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), and dementia. She was admitted for hypoxia. The patient's current medications include prednisone and plaquenil for RA, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and haldol for agitation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/55 to 147/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a fluid balance of -284 mL since midnight. She is also on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///32/. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxia, exacerbation of respiratory failure, fluid overload or imbalance, and possible complications related to atrial flutter/fibrillation. The patient's RA and associated ILD may contribute to her poor pulmonary reserve, making her more susceptible to respiratory complications. Additionally, the presence of CHF increases the risk of fluid overload and related complications. The patient's dementia and"
