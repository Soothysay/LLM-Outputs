   Assessment and Plan
   69yo gentleman with recurrent admissions for hypotension +/- renal
   failure and aspiration presenting with hypotension and acute renal
   failure.
   # Hypotension: Feel that his hypotension was most likely toxic
   ingestion given both hypotension and bradycardia.  Some component may
   have also been hypovolemia.  Less likely sepsis given lack of fever or
   localizing infectious signs.  Also could consider adrenal insuficiency
   given low Na and high K on admission, although this doesn
t explain his
   entire presentation.
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test this am
   - consider psychiatry consult in AM
   - directly observe all medication doses so that he cannot hoard
   medications
   - monitor Uop and mental status
   - f/u urine and blood cultures
   - empirically started antibiotics last evening for possible HAP.  Will
   continue x 48 hours until cultures are negative and then stop
   antibiotics as low clinical suspicion.  Now on day 2 of
   Vanco/Meropenem/Levaquin of 8 day course
   - could consider glucagon but feel beta blocker overdose will wear off
   within this time frame anyway
   - wean dopamine at this time; may need to switch to Levophed given h/o
   tachyarrhythmias
   - can give 1L IVF over 2 hours to help wean off pressors completely
   # Acute renal failure:  Had rapid rise in creatinine from 1.1 on
   discharge two days ago to 4.0 on admission yesterday.  Now rapidly
   resolving.  He initially had a small anion gap on admission, this has
   resolved.  He could have severe prerenal renal failure vs toxic
   ingestion.
   - monitor Chem 10 [**Hospital1 **]
   - avoid renally toxic medications, renally dose his gabapentin
   - support blood pressure as needed
   # Chest pain:  Patient does not give consistent history about his chest
   pain.  Serum biomarkers negative x 3, ECG unchanged from baseline.
   - continue ASA
   # Asterixis: No known h/o liver disease.  [**Month (only) 60**] be related to renal
   failure, although he does not have other signs of uremia.
   - LFTs wnl
   # Seizures: Continue keppra
   # Type 2 DM and peripheral neuropathy: Has had uncontrolled sugars
   since admission after drinking ginger ale, were lower at presentation.
   - continue insulin, ASA, and gabapentin
   # H/o HTN:  Currently holding home BP meds (amlodipine, metoprolol,
   imdur and lisinopril)
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue statin
   # H/o Depression:  Continue cymbalta, need to readdress suicidal
   ideation and feelings of depression multiple times during this
   hospitalization.  Close psych follow-up may prevent a similar admission
   in the future.
   # Chronic pain and spinal stenosis:  Continue oxycodone
   # Neurogenic bladder:  Continue ditropan
   # GERD:  Continue PPI

   Disposition: ICU for now, to medicine floor once off pressors and

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with recurrent admissions for hypotension, renal failure, and aspiration. He presented with hypotension and acute renal failure. His hypotension was likely due to toxic ingestion, with possible hypovolemia. Other potential causes include sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or a beta blocker overdose. The patient's acute renal failure is resolving, and he may have severe prerenal renal failure or toxic ingestion. He has a history of type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, chronic pain, spinal stenosis, and neurogenic bladder. He is currently being treated with various medications, including insulin, ASA, gabapentin, cymbalta, oxycodone, ditropan, and a PPI. The patient's chest pain is not consistent, and his serum biomarkers are negative. He also has asterixis and seizures, but no known history of liver disease. His labs show abnormalities in sodium, potassium, creatinine, and other parameters. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for now, then transfer to the medicine floor once off pressors and hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to further renal dysfunction or shock.
2. Ac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of recurrent admissions for hypotension, renal failure, and aspiration. He is currently admitted for hypotension and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities including depression, bronchiectasis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic pain with spinal stenosis, neurogenic bladder, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to toxic ingestion, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management is required.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rapid rise in creatinine suggests acute renal failure. Monitoring of kidney function and avoidance of renally toxic medications are necessary.
3. Bronchiectasis: The patient likely has chronic chest infections with bronchiectasis. Bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotic therapy may be needed.
4. Depression: The patient's significant psych history indicates a need for psychiatric input and close follow-up.
5. Chest Pain: The patient's inconsistent history about chest pain and negative serum biomarkers suggest further investigation to determine the cause.

   Assessment and Plan
   69yo gentleman with recurrent admissions for hypotension +/- renal
   failure and aspiration presenting with hypotension and acute renal
   failure.
   # Hypotension: Feel that his hypotension was most likely toxic
   ingestion and poor medication management given both hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Some component may have also been hypovolemia.  Less
   likely sepsis given lack of fever or localizing infectious signs.  Also
   could consider adrenal insuficiency given low Na and high K on
   admission, although [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim appropriate (but does have low morning
   cortisol levels).  Now off pressors for more than 24 hours and BP
   stable and WNL.
   - directly observe all medication doses so that he cannot hoard
   medications
   - monitor Uop and mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - IVF as necessary to support BP, although has not been requiring these
   # H/o Depression:  Has significant psych history with major depression,
   stays in [**Hospital1 **] 4 in the past, and multiple instances of hoarding
   medications and possible toxic ingestions in the past.
   - Appreciate psych recs
   - Will touch base with PCP regarding dispo issues and how he can best
   manage his medications
   - Consider stopping gabapentin, will ask PCP about his thoughts
   - PT/OT consults
   - Social work consult and case management assistance, will ask CM to
   contact former [**Name (NI) **]
   - Consider outpatient neuropsych testing
   - Continue Cymbalta
   # Bronchiectasis: Feel that he likely has chronic chest infection with
   increased WBC and CXR waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] over multiple admissions.
   With significant evidence of bronchiectasis on chest CT prior to last
   discharge.
   - Continue albuterol and Atrovent for bronchodilation
   - Bronchopulmonary hygiene and chest PT as tolerated by the patient
   - 10 days Vancomycin to be continued while in the hospital and if
   patient goes to rehab.  Not sure it is worth keeping him in the
   hospital to finish this course, as it is only for suppressive therapy
   - Needs follow-up in pulmonary clinic and possibly discharge to
   pulmonary rehab vs other rehab
   # Acute renal failure:  Had rapid rise in creatinine from 1.1 on
   discharge two days ago to 4.0 on admission, now back to baseline.  He
   could have had severe prerenal renal failure vs toxic ingestion.
   - monitor Chem 10 daily
   - avoid renally toxic medications, renally dose his gabapentin
   - support blood pressure as needed
   #. Anemia: Hct downtrending, likely dilutional but was 37 on admission,
   now downtrending to 29.  All other blood counts also downtrending.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Chest pain:  Patient does not give consistent history about his chest
   pain.  Serum biomarkers negative x 3, ECG unchanged from baseline.
   - continue ASA
   # Seizures: Continue keppra
   # Type 2 DM and peripheral neuropathy: Has had uncontrolled sugars
   since admission after drinking ginger ale, were lower at presentation.
   - continue insulin, ASA, and gabapentin
   # H/o HTN:  Currently holding home BP meds (amlodipine, metoprolol,
   imdur and lisinopril)
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue statin
   # Chronic pain and spinal stenosis:  Continue oxycodone
   # Neurogenic bladder:  Continue ditropan
   # GERD:  Continue PPI

   Disposition: ICU for now, to medicine floor possibly today
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with recurrent admissions for hypotension, renal failure, and aspiration. He presented with hypotension and acute renal failure. 

The patient's hypotension was likely due to toxic ingestion, although hypovolemia and adrenal insufficiency were also considered. The patient is now off pressors and his blood pressure is stable.

The patient has a significant psychiatric history, including major depression and multiple instances of hoarding medications and possible toxic ingestions in the past. Psychiatric recommendations were appreciated, and it was decided to touch base with the primary care physician regarding disposition issues and how to best manage the patient's medications. The possibility of stopping gabapentin was also considered.

The patient is suspected to have bronchiectasis, as evidenced by increased white blood cell count and chest X-ray findings. He was started on bronchodilators and chest physiotherapy. He will require follow-up in the pulmonary clinic and may need to be discharged to pulmonary rehab.

The patient experienced acute renal failure, with a rapid rise in creatinine levels. This could have been due to severe prerenal renal failure or toxic ingestion. Renal function will need to be closely monitored, and the patient should avoid renally toxic medications.

Other conditions noted in the patient's history include anemia, chest pain, seizures, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic pain and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has a history of multiple antibiotic use, including meropenem, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. The patient also received heparin sodium for prophylaxis and pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is largely unchanged from admission, except for fatigue, which is a constitutional symptom. The patient does not have any respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, or neurologic complaints. There are no signs of abuse or pain reported.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate within normal range, and blood pressure within normal limits. Respiratory support is not required, and oxygen saturation is at 94%. The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Chest expansion is symmetric, and breath sounds are clear bilaterally without wheezing or crackles. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with present bowel sounds, no distention, and no tenderness. Extremities show trace edema in both lower extremities, and there are no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, oriented, and"
