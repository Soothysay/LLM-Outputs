   Assessment and Plan
 CHEST PAIN
   73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF
   30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA on
   [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent
   chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab c/b tumor-lysis syndrome.
   Originally presented to oncology service on [**2150-12-6**] with LLQ pain
   that in past has been consistent with worsening of his lymphoma.
   #. Chest pain:
   Patient has had four ~10 minute episodes of crushing substernal chest
   pain. Associated EKG changes. Cardiology has been made aware of the
   patient's ongoing chest pain. He has received a complete cycle of 3
   sets of cardiac biomarkers any a 24 hour period without evidence of
   NSTEMI. Though chest pain is most likely consistent with prior
   ischemia, must also consider additional etiologies of chest pain. Given
   cough with sputum and new infiltrate on CXR, should keep pneumonia on
   our minds as another etiology of chest pain or as an incidental
   finding.
   - Two additional sets of cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat EKG if additional CP episodes
   - Follow-up additional set of cardiac biomarkers at midnight and 0600
   - Consider anticoagulation with heparin if additional chest apin
   - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol as tolerated
   - Cardiology consult to assist in ongoing managment in AM or sooner if
   repeat episodes of CP overnight
   - Trend fever curve and monitor of leukocytosis
   #. Follicular lymphoma:
   Patient is now day two of oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron
   administered. Originally scheduled to receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**].
   Last time he had this regimen he developed tumor lysis syndrome. In
   setting of missed dialysis, potassium is elevated. Phosphate up
   slightly this evening to 4.8 from 4.3 earlier. Uric acid up to 8.7 from
   7.7. LDH is stable.
   - Appreciate oncology input regarding further chemotherapy in setting
   of transfer to ICU
   - Monitor K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q6H
   - Decadron 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**]
   - Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   - Tomorrow: rituximab scheduled currently, if we decide to proceed, it
   must be give *after* dialysis
   - Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to rituximab
   #. Hyperkalemia:
   Patient's K has been climbing today in setting of missed dialysis due
   to holiday in addition to tumor lysis. EKGs from earlier in day are
   concerning for more prominent T waves as well as a widened QRS to ~150
   in background of baseline QRS ~120. Calcium gluconate was not given at
   that time.
   - Checking Q6H lytes
   - Repeat EKG if potassium elevated above 6.4
   - Pending EKG, will decide on calcium gluconate, though should likely
   give additional kaexylate and D50 + insulin if K still elevated
   # Hyperuricemia:  Uric acid climbing through the day yesterday in
   setting of tumor lysis and renal failure.
   - consider rasburicase.
   #. Hypotension:
   Patient is having period asymptomatic BP dropping to 70s systolic.
   Possible that this is not a true [**Location (un) **] given excellent mental status.
   Will have to attempt to corraborate with manual arm pressures and as a
   last resort will need to place arterial line to obtain a true pressure.
   #. ESRD:
   HD MWF at [**Location (un) 4465**] [**Location (un) 590**] as an outpatient. Received HD [**1-6**]. Calcium
   acetate had been stopped and phos repleted given very low phosphate
   earlier in course, though phos has climbed to 4.8 prior to transfer to
   the ICU. No urgent indication for HD currently, though volume
   management is becoming problem[**Name (NI) 595**].
   - Dialysis tomorrow
   - Continue renal diet
   - Trend phos/K
   #. Diabetes:
   - QID FS
   - ISS if needed
   #. CHF:
   Currently appears volume up by CXR and pulm exam.
   - Continue lisinopril, metoprolol as tolerated
   - Dialysis tomorrow

   would not want to know his prognosis as it may destroy his hopes of
   recovery. Family requests Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6521**] to be involved in any goals of
   care discussion.
   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), chronic systolic heart failure (sCHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a bare metal stent (BMS) to the right coronary artery (RCA), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma treated with recent chemotherapy including vincristine and rituximab, which increases the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).

The patient presented to the oncology service on [**2150-12-6**] with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain, consistent with worsening lymphoma. He was initially assessed by the oncology service but was later transferred to the ICU due to the development of chest pain and worsening symptoms.

The patient has had four episodes of crushing substernal chest pain, associated with EKG changes. Cardiology has been informed of these ongoing chest pain episodes. Although the chest pain is likely consistent with prior ischemia, other potential causes such as pneumonia should also be considered given the patient's cough with sputum production and new infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Additional sets of cardiac enzymes are planned, along with repeat EKG if further episodes of chest pain occur. Heparin sodium has"

The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels, worsening uric acid, and elevated phosphate levels. He has been scheduled to receive rituximab on 01/09/2151, but this may need to be postponed until after dialysis due to missed dialysis and the risk of tumor lysis syndrome.

 CHEST PAIN
   73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF
   30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA on
   [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent
   chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab c/b tumor-lysis syndrome.
   Originally presented to oncology service on [**2150-12-6**] with LLQ pain
   that in past has been consistent with worsening of his lymphoma.
   #. Chest pain:  No further chest pain overnight, AM enzymes are
   pending.  4 episodes yesterday, likely [**2-16**] to fluid overload causing
   strain on his heart.  Very tenuous heart, w/ known CAD and severe AS.
   Troponins are likely at his baseline and have been trending slowly
   down.  No further signs of pneumonia.
   - f/u morning cardiac enzymes.
   - Repeat EKG if additional CP episodes
   - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol as tolerated.
   - Cardiology consult to assist in ongoing managment in AM or sooner if
   repeat episodes of CP overnight
   - Trend fever curve and monitor of leukocytosis
   #. Follicular lymphoma:
   Patient is now day two of oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron
   administered. Originally scheduled to receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**].
   Last time he had this regimen he developed tumor lysis syndrome. In
   setting of missed dialysis, potassium is elevated. Phosphate up
   slightly this evening to 4.8 from 4.3 earlier. Uric acid up to 8.7 from
   7.7. LDH is stable.
   - Appreciate oncology input regarding further chemotherapy in setting
   of transfer to ICU.  Need to clarify with them whether to give
   Rituximab.
   - Monitor K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q8H
   - Decadron 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**]
   - Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   - Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to rituximab
   #. Hyperkalemia:
   Potassium improved overnight after kayexalate and large BM.
   - Checking Q6H lytes
   - Repeat EKG if potassium trending up.
   - If EKG changes, give calcium gluconate, consider D50 w/ regular
   insulin.  Then give kayexalate.
   # Hyperuricemia:  Uric acid climbing through the day yesterday in
   setting of tumor lysis and renal failure.
   - would usually consider rasburicase, but given ESRD, unlikely to have
   a clinical effect.  Will simply monitor for now and continue
   allopurinol.
   #. Hypotension:
   Patient is having period asymptomatic BP dropping to 70s systolic.
   Possible that this is not a true [**Location (un) **] given excellent mental status
   and that we are getting BPs from thigh cuff.  This morning, dialysis
   nurse says left leg better, unclear why right arm cannot be used and
   patient does not know.
   - If he becomes at all mentally altered, place A-line.
   #. ESRD:
   HD MWF at [**Location (un) 4465**] [**Location (un) 590**] as an outpatient. Received HD [**1-6**]. Calcium
   acetate had been stopped and phos repleted given very low phosphate
   earlier in course, though phos has climbed to 4.8 prior to transfer to
   the ICU. Will be dialyzed today.
   - Continue renal diet
   - Trend phos/K
   #. Diabetes:
   - QID FS
   - ISS if needed
   #. CHF:
   Currently appears volume up by CXR and pulm exam.
   - Continue lisinopril, metoprolol when blood pressure tolerates.
   - Should improve with dialysis.

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease with a bare metal stent in the right coronary artery, and B-cell lymphoma. He presented to the oncology service with left lower quadrant pain, which has been consistent with worsening of his lymphoma. The patient received chemotherapy with vincristine and rituximab, but developed tumor lysis syndrome. He is currently on oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron, and was scheduled to receive rituximab today.

The patient's chief complaint is chest pain, which has occurred four times yesterday and is likely due to fluid overload causing strain on his heart. Troponins are trending slowly down and there are no signs of pneumonia. The patient's cardiac enzymes will be followed up in the morning, and an EKG will be repeated if additional episodes of chest pain occur. Cardiology consultation will be sought for ongoing management.

The patient also has hyperkalemia, which improved overnight after kayexalate and large bowel movement. Potassium levels will be checked every six hours, and an EKG will be repeated if potassium is trending up. If EKG changes are observed, calcium gluconate will be given, followed by kayexalate.

 CHEST PAIN
   73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF
   30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA on
   [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent
   chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab c/b tumor-lysis syndrome.
   Originally presented to oncology service on [**2150-12-6**] with LLQ pain
   that in past has been consistent with worsening of his lymphoma.
   #. Chest pain:
   Patient has had four ~10 minute episodes of crushing substernal chest
   pain. Associated EKG changes. Cardiology has been made aware of the
   patient's ongoing chest pain. He has received a complete cycle of 3
   sets of cardiac biomarkers any a 24 hour period without evidence of
   NSTEMI. Though chest pain is most likely consistent with prior
   ischemia, must also consider additional etiologies of chest pain. Given
   cough with sputum and new infiltrate on CXR, should keep pneumonia on
   our minds as another etiology of chest pain or as an incidental
   finding.
   - Two additional sets of cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat EKG if additional CP episodes
   - Follow-up additional set of cardiac biomarkers at midnight and 0600
   - Consider anticoagulation with heparin if additional chest apin
   - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol as tolerated
   - Cardiology consult to assist in ongoing managment in AM or sooner if
   repeat episodes of CP overnight
   - Trend fever curve and monitor of leukocytosis
   #. Follicular lymphoma:
   Patient is now day two of oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron
   administered. Originally scheduled to receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**].
   Last time he had this regimen he developed tumor lysis syndrome. In
   setting of missed dialysis, potassium is elevated. Phosphate up
   slightly this evening to 4.8 from 4.3 earlier. Uric acid up to 8.7 from
   7.7. LDH is stable.
   - Appreciate oncology input regarding further chemotherapy in setting
   of transfer to ICU
   - Monitor K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q6H
   - Decadron 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**]
   - Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   - Tomorrow: rituximab scheduled currently, if we decide to proceed, it
   must be give *after* dialysis
   - Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to rituximab
   #. Hyperkalemia:
   Patient's K has been climbing today in setting of missed dialysis due
   to holiday in addition to tumor lysis. EKGs from earlier in day are
   concerning for more prominent T waves as well as a widened QRS to ~150
   in background of baseline QRS ~120. Calcium gluconate was not given at
   that time.
   - Checking Q6H lytes
   - Repeat EKG if potassium elevated above 6.4
   - Pending EKG, will decide on calcium gluconate, though should likely
   give additional kaexylate and D50 + insulin if K still elevated
   # Hyperuricemia:  Uric acid climbing through the day yesterday in
   setting of tumor lysis and renal failure.
   - consider rasburicase.
   #. Hypotension:
   Patient is having period asymptomatic BP dropping to 70s systolic.
   Possible that this is not a true [**Location (un) **] given excellent mental status.
   Will have to attempt to corraborate with manual arm pressures and as a
   last resort will need to place arterial line to obtain a true pressure.
   #. ESRD:
   HD MWF at [**Location (un) 4465**] [**Location (un) 590**] as an outpatient. Received HD [**1-6**]. Calcium
   acetate had been stopped and phos repleted given very low phosphate
   earlier in course, though phos has climbed to 4.8 prior to transfer to
   the ICU. No urgent indication for HD currently, though volume
   management is becoming problem[**Name (NI) 595**].
   - Dialysis tomorrow
   - Continue renal diet
   - Trend phos/K
   #. Diabetes:
   - QID FS
   - ISS if needed

   Currently appears volume up by CXR and pulm exam.
   - Continue lisinopril, metoprolol as tolerated

The patient has had four episodes of crushing substernal chest pain with associated EKG changes, but no evidence of NSTEMI. There are concerns for pneumonia as well. The patient's labs show improved potassium but worsening uric acid. He has hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hypotension. The patient is scheduled for chemotherapy tomorrow, but due to his recent tumor lysis syndrome, it will be given after dialysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who recently experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He is currently receiving rituximab chemotherapy, which has been complicated by tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to chest pain and medication-induced hypotension. He has an indwelling port and dialysis catheter inserted yesterday evening. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/43 mmHg to 60/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination is largely unremarkable, except for diminished radial pulses on the right and left arms. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.2 g/dL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.7%, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 65 K/uL, increased creatinine (Cr) of 6.5 mg/dL, increased glucose level of 253 mg/dL, and abnormal electrolyte levels including potassium (K+) of 3.4 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 140 mEq"

   24 Hour Events:
   --Patient had an episode of chest pain overnight, which was consistent
   with previous episodes of angina.  Patient was treated with dilaudid
   and ativan; nitro not given due to severe AS.  Most likely real chest
   pain, given cardiac history.  We thought that chest pain might be
   related to hypotension (poor cardiac perfusino) so we gave back a
   little bit of fluid.  Cardiology was curbsided, who said that patient
   is not a candidate for cath given his extensive disease.  Patient
   eventually fell asleep and the rest of the night was uneventful.

 CHEST PAIN
   73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF
   30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA on
   [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent
   chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab c/b tumor-lysis syndrome.
   Transferred from OMED for frequent episodes of chest pain.
   #. Chest pain:   One episode of chest pain overnight.  Enzymes are
   flat, but EKG did show some increased ST depressions in lead 1.
   Cardiology was curbsided who confirmed that patient is not a good
   candidate for stenting due to his extensive disease.  Patient also has
   bad cough; an element of pleuritis might be involved in chest pain as
   well.
   - f/u morning cardiac enzymes.
   - Repeat EKG if additional CP episodes
   - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol as tolerated.
   - Cardiology consult to assist in ongoing managment
   - Trend fever curve and monitor of leukocytosis
   #. Follicular lymphoma:
   Patient is now day three of oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron
   administered. Originally scheduled to receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**],
   but most likely will not get it until [**1-10**].  Last time he had this
   regimen he developed tumor lysis syndrome.  Phosphate up slightly this
   evening to 4.8 from 4.3 earlier. Uric acid up to 8.7 from 7.7. LDH is
   stable.
   - Appreciate oncology input regarding further chemotherapy in setting
   of transfer to ICU.  Need to clarify with them whether to give
   Rituximab.
   - Monitor K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q8H
   - Decadron 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**]
   - Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   - Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to rituximab
   #. Hyperkalemia:
   Potassium improved overnight after kayexalate and large BM.
   - Checking Q6H lytes
   - Repeat EKG if potassium trending up.
   - If EKG changes, give calcium gluconate, consider D50 w/ regular
   insulin.  Then give kayexalate.
   # Hyperuricemia:  Uric acid climbing through the day yesterday in
   setting of tumor lysis and renal failure.
   - would usually consider rasburicase, but given ESRD, unlikely to have
   a clinical effect.  Will simply monitor for now and continue
   allopurinol.
   #. Hypotension:
   Patient is having period asymptomatic BP dropping to 70s systolic.
   Possible that this is not a true [**Location (un) **] given excellent mental status
   and that we are getting BPs from thigh cuff.  This morning, dialysis
   nurse says left leg better, unclear why right arm cannot be used and
   patient does not know.
   - If he becomes at all mentally altered, place A-line.
   #. ESRD:
   HD MWF at [**Location (un) 4465**] [**Location (un) 590**] as an outpatient. Received HD [**1-6**]. Calcium
   acetate had been stopped and phos repleted given very low phosphate
   earlier in course, though phos has climbed to 4.8 prior to transfer to
   the ICU. Will be dialyzed today.
   - Continue renal diet
   - Trend phos/K
   #. Diabetes:
   - QID FS
   - ISS if needed
   #. CHF:
   Currently appears volume up by CXR and pulm exam.
   - Continue lisinopril, metoprolol when blood pressure tolerates.
   - Should improve with dialysis.

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30%), moderate to severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.9), coronary artery disease with bare-metal stent to right coronary artery, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) on [2150-12-7], and B-cell lymphoma with recent chemotherapy including vincristine and rituximab. The patient was transferred from the oncology medical emergency department for frequent episodes of chest pain. 

On the current day, the patient had an episode of chest pain overnight, which was consistent with previous episodes of angina. The patient was treated with dilaudid and ativan, but nitro was not given due to severe AS. The patient's blood pressure remained in the 60s and the cardiac enzymes are flat, although the EKG showed some increased ST depressions in lead 1. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was deemed not a candidate for catheterization given his extensive disease. The patient also has a bad cough, which might be contributing to the chest pain.

The patient's other medical conditions include follicular lymphoma, for which he is currently receiving chemotherapy. He developed tumor lysis syndrome previously and has elevated phosphate and uric acid levels. Hyperkalemia improved overnight after kayexalate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with chest pain consistent with angina, which was treated with dilaudid and ativan. The patient remains hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 60s. Cardiology has ruled out the possibility of undergoing cardiac catheterization due to extensive disease. The patient received dialysis yesterday morning and had 1 liter removed. His family is aware of the situation. The patient continues to be on various medications including lorazepam, hydromorphone, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and ongoing chest pain suggest the possibility of cardiac ischemia. This could lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low systolic blood pressures indicate hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of shock.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's history of CKD and recent dialysis indicate ongoing renal dysfunction. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased susceptibility to infections.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and differential may indicate an infection. In the ICU setting, this could be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or"

 CHEST PAIN
   73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF
   30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA on
   [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent
   chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab complicated by tumor-lysis
   syndrome.  Patient transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for recurrent episodes of chest
   pain.
   #. Chest pain:   One episode of chest pain overnight, concerning for
   ischemia.  Very difficult to treat patient, as we
re loathe to give
   nitrates in light of AS, and cardiogy states that he is not a good
   candidate for stenting/CABG.  As such, we
ve just been treating the
   patient symptomatically, doing EKGs, and cycling enzymes.  However,
   with new onset cough, some chest pain may be related to pleuritis, but
   doubt this is responsible for acute attacks.
   - Cardiology consult for further management
   - Dilaudid, ativan, other acceptable pain management for now
   - 02 to maintain sats and for comfort
   - Would consider BB, though BP is quite low
   - Repeat EKG if additional CP episodes
   - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - Obtain repeat CXR to check for brewing PNA
   #. Hypotension:  Patient with baseline systolic blood pressures in the
   60s-70s.  Unclear if this is an accurate [**Location (un) **], as we
ve been putting
   the cuff on patient
s thigh (can
t get readings on either arm).
   However, even during episodes of hypotension, patient mentates well and
   has no signs/symptoms of decreased perfusion.  We need a more accurate
   measurement.
   - Discuss with patient, cardiology, other providers about the utility
   of placing A-line.
   #. Follicular lymphoma:
   Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron
   administered. Originally scheduled to receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**],
   but held off due to episode of chest pain on the floor.  Moreover, the
   last time Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 6471**] received this regimen he had severe tumor lysis
   syndrome.  As such, we
re trending tumor lysis labs.  Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 6471**] was
   set to continue the chemotherapy today, but we
ll have to see how
   things play out with his chest pain
   - Appreciate oncology input regarding further chemotherapy in setting
   of transfer to ICU.  Need to clarify with them whether to give
   Rituximab.
   - Monitor K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12 (or Q8 if labs continue to be
   unconcerning)
   - Decadron 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**]
   - Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   - Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to rituximab
   #. Hypokalemia:  In setting of dialysis and kayexelate.  Continue to
   replete as needed.
   #. ESRD:  On dialysis MWF.  Last dialysis was on [**1-8**]; next scheduled
   for [**1-11**], but we
ll need to confirm with renal.
   #. Diabetes:
   - QID FS
   - ISS if needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30%), moderate to severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.9), coronary artery disease with bare-metal stent placement in the right coronary artery, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent chemotherapy involving vincristine and rituximab complicated by tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was transferred to the ICU for recurrent episodes of chest pain.

The patient experienced an episode of chest pain overnight, consistent with previous episodes of angina. He was treated with dilaudid (hydromorphone) and ativan (lorazepam); however, nitro was not given due to severe aortic stenosis. The patient continues to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 60s. Cardiology was consulted, and they determined that the patient is not a candidate for cardiac catheterization or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient received dialysis yesterday morning, with 1 liter removed.

The patient's allergies include aspirin, which causes upset stomach. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2151-1-10**]. The patient is currently receiving several infusions, including"

   *Cardiology consult for further recommendations
   *Pain control with narcotics, minimize agitation
   *Consider invasive BP monitoring
   *Likely will need to set up meeting with [**Hospital **] health care providers, pt

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of B-cell lymphoma, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and aortic stenosis. He presents with persistent chest pain and hypotension. The patient has undergone chemotherapy for NHL, and his tumor lysis syndrome labs are unchanged. He is also on hemodialysis for ESRD. The patient's condition is complicated by inadequate supply-demand ratio, volume overload, and hypotension, making medical management more difficult. The patient's anginal equivalent chest pain is aggravated at various times. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe CAD, CHF, and aortic stenosis.
2. Hypotension leading to organ perfusion and potential ischemia.
3. Tumor lysis syndrome due to ongoing chemotherapy for NHL.
4. Infection due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy and ESRD.
5. Fluid overload from inadequate cardiac output and dialysis issues.
6. Arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and structural heart disease.
7. Acute kidney injury due to hypotension and volume overload.
8. Respiratory distress due to poor oxygenation and pulmonary edema.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcers or anticoagulation.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulable state."

 CHEST PAIN
   73 yo male with NHL, ESRD< CAD, CHF, AoS with persistent CP and
   hypotension
   1. CP
   *Character sounds like pt's anginal equivalent, aggravated at various
   times by inadequate supply-demand ratio, including volume overload and
   hypotension. Pt's CAD, low BP of unclear accuracy, Aortic stenosis all
   making medical management more difficult
   *Cardiology consult for further recommendations
   *Pain control with narcotics, minimize agitation
   *Consider invasive BP monitoring
   *Likely will need to set up meeting with [**Hospital **] health care providers, pt
   and family to review course and limited tx options. Pt has historically
   not wanted to hear explicit details abt his medical care, so will need
   to clarify ahead of time with family. [**Month (only) 51**] be worthwhile getting SW
   involved.
   2. NHL: undergoing chemotherapy, cycle held yesterday. Onc continuing
   to follow. Tumor lysis labs unchanged.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AoS), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), B-cell lymphoma (NHL), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. 

The patient presented with chest pain and hypotension, which are concerning symptoms. The chest pain is described as the patient's anginal equivalent and is aggravated by inadequate supply-demand ratio, including volume overload and hypotension. The patient's CAD, low blood pressure of unclear accuracy, and AoS all make medical management more difficult.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. 

The physical examination reveals diminished radial pulses, warm skin, and no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically, the patient is attentive and follows simple commands but movement and tone assessments are not performed due to the patient being sedated and paralyzed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LD"

 CHEST PAIN
   73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF
   30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA on
   [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent
   chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab complicated by tumor-lysis
   syndrome.  Patient transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for recurrent episodes of chest
   pain.
   #. Chest pain:   Consistent with ischemia but  difficult to treat, as
   cannot nitrates in light of AS, and cardiogy states that he is not a
   good candidate for stenting/CABG.  As such, we
ve just been treating
   the patient symptomatically with Dilaudid, Ativan.  CXR does show
   worsening opacity c/w possible infection, but unclear if pain is
   associated with this. Patient had one episode NSVT this AM,
   asymptomatic.  Trop 0.3.
   - appreciate Cardiology recs
   - cont digoxin every other day to improve rate control
   - attempt to initiate beta-blocker if BP tolerates
   - transfuse for HCT<30
   - trend CE, consider anticoagulation
   - Dilaudid, ativan, other acceptable pain management for now
   - 02 to maintain sats and for comfort
   - Repeat EKG if additional CP episodes
   - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient with baseline systolic blood pressures in the
   60s-70s.  Unclear if this is an accurate [**Location (un) **], as we
ve been putting
   the cuff on patient
s thigh (can
t get readings on either arm).
   However, even during episodes of hypotension, patient mentates well and
   has no signs/symptoms of decreased perfusion.  We need a more accurate
   measurement.
   - Discuss with patient, cardiology, other providers about the utility
   of placing A-line.
   #. Follicular lymphoma:
   Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron
   administered. Originally scheduled to receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**],
   but held off due to episode of chest pain on the floor
   - Appreciate oncology input regarding further chemotherapy in setting
   of transfer to ICU.  Need to clarify with them whether to give
   Rituximab.
   - Monitor K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12 (or Q8 if labs continue to be
   unconcerning)
   - Decadron 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**]
   - Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   - Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to rituximab
   #. Hypokalemia:  In setting of dialysis and kayexelate.  Continue to
   replete as needed.
   #. ESRD:  On dialysis MWF.  Last dialysis was on [**1-8**]; next scheduled
   for [**1-11**], but we
ll need to confirm with renal.
   #. Diabetes:
   - QID FS
   - ISS if needed

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with multiple comorbidities including ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF 30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA, recent NSTEMI, and B-cell lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy. He presented to the ICU with recurrent episodes of chest pain.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 49/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. He is currently on various medications including ranitidine, lorazepam, hydromorphone, and heparin sodium.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the right lung base to mid-lung, regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, trace edema bilaterally, and peripheral pulses present. His abdominal examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, sodium level of 151 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 6.5 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided, indicating ongoing kidney dysfunction.

 CHEST PAIN
   73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF (EF
   30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS to RCA on
   [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent
   chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab complicated by tumor-lysis
   syndrome.  Patient transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for recurrent episodes of chest
   pain.
   #. Chest pain:   Consistent with ischemia but  difficult to treat, as
   cannot nitrates in light of AS, and cardiogy states that he is not a
   good candidate for stenting/CABG.  As such, we
ve just been treating
   the patient symptomatically with Dilaudid, Ativan.  CXR does show
   worsening opacity c/w possible infection, but unclear if pain is
   associated with this. Patient had one episode NSVT this AM,
   asymptomatic.  Trop 0.3, may be [**2-16**] decreased renal clearance but CKMB
   also elevated from yest. Is not candidate for intervention or optimal
   medical management at this point, so will not continue to trend CE
   unless chest pain/EKG look worse.
   - appreciate Cardiology recs
   - cont digoxin every other day to improve rate control
   - start metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**] as tolerated given low BPs
   - transfuse for HCT<30, 1 unit today
   - Dilaudid, ativan, other acceptable pain management for now
   - 02 to maintain sats and for comfort
   - Repeat EKG if additional CP episodes
   - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   .
   # hypoxia: unclear etiology, 02 requirement has increased slightly
   since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) without any worsening of respiratory
   symptoms or CXR. No WBC/fever, but will monitor closely since these
   signs may not present themselves [**2-16**] lymphoma and steroids.
   - repeat CXR after HD
   - consider vanco/zosyn/levaquin if CXR worsens or clinical status
   worsens
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient had systolic blood pressures in the 60s-70s.
   However, even during episodes of hypotension, patient mentates well and
   has no signs/symptoms of decreased perfusion. Improved after HD today
   and stable in 90s.
   #. Follicular lymphoma:
   Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron
   administered. Originally scheduled to receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**],
   but held off due to episode of chest pain on the floor
   - Appreciate oncology input regarding further chemotherapy in setting
   of transfer to ICU.  Need to clarify with them whether to give
   Rituximab.
   - Monitor K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12 (or Q8 if labs continue to be
   unconcerning)
   - Decadron 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**]
   - Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   - Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to rituximab
   #. Hypokalemia:  In setting of dialysis and kayexelate.  Continue to
   replete as needed.
   #. ESRD:  On dialysis MWF.  Last dialysis was on [**1-8**]; next scheduled
   for [**1-11**], but we
ll need to confirm with renal.
   #. Diabetes:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock secondary to pneumonia. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. He presented with complaints of chest pain and difficulty breathing. Upon admission, he was hypotensive and tachycardic. Initial laboratory results showed leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, and signs of renal dysfunction. Chest X-ray revealed opacities in the left lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia.

During the course of treatment, the patient received various medications including antibiotics, ranitidine (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's vital signs have been unstable with persistent hypotension and tachycardia. Oxygen saturation has remained below 90%. Crackles were noted in the right lung base during physical examination. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 49/31 mmHg to 93/49 mmHg. Heart rate has been elevated, ranging from 94 to 120 bpm.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperur"

   - attempt to initiate beta-blocker if BP tolerates
   - transfuse for HCT<30
   - trend CE, consider anticoagulation
   - Dilaudid, ativan, other acceptable pain management for now
   - 02 to maintain sats and for comfort

   #. Hypotension:  Patient with baseline systolic blood pressures in the
   60s-70s.  Unclear if this is an accurate [**Location (un) **], as we
ve been putting
   the cuff on patient
s thigh (can
t get readings on either arm).
   However, even during episodes of hypotension, patient mentates well and
   has no signs/symptoms of decreased perfusion.  We need a more accurate
   measurement.
   - Discuss with patient, cardiology, other providers about the utility
   of placing A-line.
   #. Follicular lymphoma:
   Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron
   administered. Originally scheduled to receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**],
   but held off due to episode of chest pain on the floor
   - Appreciate oncology input regarding further chemotherapy in setting
   of transfer to ICU.  Need to clarify with them whether to give
   Rituximab.
   - Monitor K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12 (or Q8 if labs continue to be
   unconcerning)
   - Decadron 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**]
   - Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   - Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to rituximab
   #. Hypokalemia:  In setting of dialysis and kayexelate.  Continue to
   replete as needed.
   #. ESRD:  On dialysis MWF.  Last dialysis was on [**1-8**]; next scheduled
   for [**1-11**], but we
ll need to confirm with renal.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30%), moderate to severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.9), coronary artery disease with bare-metal stent to right coronary artery (BMS RCA) on [**2150-11-27**], recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell lymphoma with recent chemotherapy involving vincristine and rituximab complicated by tumor-lysis syndrome. The patient was transferred to the ICU for recurrent episodes of chest pain.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Chest pain: The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease, recent NSTEMI, and moderate to severe aortic stenosis. He is experiencing recurrent episodes of chest pain, which is consistent with ischemia. However, due to his aortic stenosis, he cannot tolerate nitrates, and stenting/CABG is not recommended. This places him at risk for further myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

2. Infection: The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening opacity in the retrocardiac portion of the left lower lobe and part of the adjacent lingula, suggesting evolving pneumonia. This"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and B-cell lymphoma. He is currently admitted to the ICU with chest pain, hypotension, and an elevated troponin level of 0.3. The ECG shows left bundle branch block (LBBB), left anterior descending artery (LAD) disease, sinus rhythm, and no significant ST segment elevations. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate ranging from 97 to 120 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/40 to 103/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, CAD, congestive heart failure (CHF), and B-cell lymphoma. He is currently receiving supportive care, including medication interventions for pain management, rate control, and management of his medical conditions. He is also undergoing hemodialysis for his chronic renal failure and has an indwelling Port (PortaCath) and dialysis catheter.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yoM with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, ESRD, CAD,
   CHF and AS transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] to CCU in anticipation of cardiac cath
   in setting of unstable angina.
   # CORONARIES: Patinet's symptoms, ECG changes and probably troponin
   leak are all suggestive of ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment
   of pain is unfortuantely limited by patient's low blood pressure and
   aortic stenosis. He is planned to undergo cardiac catheterization
   tomorrow as above.
   -continue metoprolol
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   -continue lisinopril for BP control
   -continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # RHYTHM: Currently in AF. Rate control appears suboptimal, and may be
   contributing to chest pain. Would consider further uptitration of beta
   blocker as patient has appeared to tolerate well thus far. On dual
   antiplatelet therapy; not anticoagulated given underlying hematologic
   malignancy.
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic. Patient has had intermittent
   hypotension throughout his course, likely related to poor forward flow
   from CHF/AS. Continue digoxin and low-dose beta blocker as tolerated.
   Would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension, although
   patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far.
   # hypoxia: Exact etiology unclear; potentially multifactorial in
   setting of possible atelectasis, small pleural effusions. 02
   requirement has increased slightly since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) Patient
   remains without any pulmonary symptoms or evidence of infection; should
   these develop, low threshold to start antibiotics given increasing
   consolidation on chest film.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - consider vanco/Zosyn/levofloxacin if CXR or clinical status worsens
   # Follicular lymphoma: Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine,
   bendamustine, and decadron administered. Originally scheduled to
   receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**], but held off due to episode of chest
   pain on the floor.
   -appreciate ongoing oncology input
   -continue close monitoring of K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12
   -dexamethasone 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**], last day tomorrow
   -allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). He was transferred from another hospital to the CCU due to unstable angina. The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and elevated troponin levels suggest ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment for pain is limited by the patient's low blood pressure and AS. The plan is to undergo cardiac catheterization tomorrow.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and probable troponin leak indicate ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment for pain is limited by the patient's low blood pressure and AS. He is planned for cardiac catheterization tomorrow.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   - Continue ASA and clopidogrel for now, understanding that the patient's thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   - Continue lisinopril for BP control
   - Continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   - Consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which may have less preload effect than nitrates, though this would still need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD.

   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # RHYTHM: Currently in AF. Rate control appears suboptimal, and may be
   contributing to chest pain. Would consider further uptitration of beta
   blocker as patient has appeared to tolerate well thus far. On dual
   antiplatelet therapy; not anticoagulated given underlying hematologic
   malignancy.
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic. Patient has had intermittent
   hypotension throughout his course, likely related to poor forward flow
   from CHF/AS. Continue digoxin and low-dose beta blocker as tolerated.
   Would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension, although
   patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far.
   # hypoxia: Exact etiology unclear; potentially multifactorial in
   setting of possible atelectasis, small pleural effusions. 02
   requirement has increased slightly since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) Patient
   remains without any pulmonary symptoms or evidence of infection; should
   these develop, low threshold to start antibiotics given increasing
   consolidation on chest film.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - consider vanco/Zosyn/levofloxacin if CXR or clinical status worsens
   # Follicular lymphoma: Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine,
   bendamustine, and decadron administered. Originally scheduled to
   receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**], but held off due to episode of chest
   pain on the floor.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yoM with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, ESRD, CAD,
   CHF and AS transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] to CCU in anticipation of cardiac cath
   in setting of unstable angina.
   # CORONARIES: Patinet's symptoms, ECG changes and probably troponin
   leak are all suggestive of ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment
   of pain is unfortuantely limited by patient's low blood pressure and
   aortic stenosis. He is planned to undergo cardiac catheterization
   tomorrow as above.
   -continue metoprolol
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   -continue lisinopril for BP control
   -continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # RHYTHM: Currently in AF. Rate control appears suboptimal, and may be
   contributing to chest pain. Would consider further uptitration of beta
   blocker as patient has appeared to tolerate well thus far. On dual
   antiplatelet therapy; not anticoagulated given underlying hematologic
   malignancy.
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic. Patient has had intermittent
   hypotension throughout his course, likely related to poor forward flow
   from CHF/AS. Continue digoxin and low-dose beta blocker as tolerated.
   Would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension, although
   patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far.
   # hypoxia: Exact etiology unclear; potentially multifactorial in
   setting of possible atelectasis, small pleural effusions. 02
   requirement has increased slightly since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) Patient
   remains without any pulmonary symptoms or evidence of infection; should
   these develop, low threshold to start antibiotics given increasing
   consolidation on chest film.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - consider vanco/Zosyn/levofloxacin if CXR or clinical status worsens
   # Follicular lymphoma: Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine,
   bendamustine, and decadron administered. Originally scheduled to
   receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**], but held off due to episode of chest
   pain on the floor.
   -appreciate ongoing oncology input
   -continue close monitoring of K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12
   -dexamethasone 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**], last day tomorrow
   -allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   # ESRD: On dialysis MWF. Last dialysis today. Appreciate renal input.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient was transferred from another hospital to the cardiac care unit (CCU) in anticipation of cardiac catheterization due to unstable angina.

The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and elevated troponin levels suggest ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment of pain is limited by the patient's low blood pressure and aortic stenosis. The plan is to proceed with cardiac catheterization tomorrow.

The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation (AF) with a suboptimal rate control, which may be contributing to chest pain. Further uptitration of beta-blockers may be considered as tolerated. The patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy but not anticoagulated due to underlying hematologic malignancy.

The patient appears fairly euvolemic overall, but intermittent hypotension has been observed throughout his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS. Digoxin and low-dose beta-blockers should be continued as tolerated, with consideration for small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension.

The patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) in anticipation of cardiac catheterization due to unstable angina.

The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and elevated troponin levels suggest ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment for pain is limited by the patient's low blood pressure and aortic stenosis. The patient is planned to undergo cardiac catheterization today.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Coronary ischemia: The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and elevated troponin levels indicate ongoing coronary ischemia. If not properly managed, this can lead to further myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

2. Low blood pressure: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to poor forward flow from CHF/AS. If not managed appropriately, it can result in organ hypoperfusion and failure.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially if anticoagulation therapy is initiated.

4. Respiratory issues: The patient has increased bibasilar consolidation on chest X-ray, indicating possible atelectasis or pneumonia. If not treated promptly,"

   of pain is unfortuantely limited by patient's low blood pressure and
   aortic stenosis. He is planned to undergo cardiac catheterization today
   as above.
   -continue metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   -hold lisinopril in setting of low BP
   -continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR, although admitted in afib. Rate control
   appears suboptimal, and may be contributing to chest pain. Would
   consider further uptitration of beta blocker as patient has appeared to
   tolerate well thus far. On dual antiplatelet therapy; not
   anticoagulated given underlying hematologic malignancy.
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with
   crackles on exam. Patient has had intermittent hypotension throughout
   his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS.
   - continue digoxin and low-dose beta blocker as tolerated
   - would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension,
   although patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far
   - cont dialysis MWF for overall fluid management
   # hypoxia: Exact etiology unclear; potentially multifactorial in
   setting of possible atelectasis, small pleural effusions. 02
   requirement has increased slightly since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) Patient
   remains without any pulmonary symptoms or evidence of infection; should
   these develop, low threshold to start antibiotics given increasing
   consolidation on chest film.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - low threshold to consider vanco/Zosyn/levofloxacin if CXR or clinical
   status worsens

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to unstable angina and is awaiting cardiac catheterization. The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and elevated troponin levels suggest ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment of pain is limited by the patient's low blood pressure and AS. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing coronary ischemia: The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and elevated troponin levels indicate ongoing coronary ischemia, which can lead to further myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest if not promptly treated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to his underlying conditions such as CHF, AS, and ESRD. If not managed appropriately, it can result in organ hypoperfusion and failure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient has increased bibasilar consolidation on chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia or worsening heart failure. This increases the risk of respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Bleeding risk: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, especially with concurrent use of antiplatelet therapy.

   73 yoM with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, ESRD, CAD,
   CHF and AS transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] to CCU in anticipation of cardiac cath
   in setting of unstable angina.
   # Hypotension: most consistent with cardiogenic shock likely
   precipitated by small ischemic event although CE flat.  No evidence of
   mechanical complication- i.e. acute valvular pathology, septal defect,
   etc; tamponade; PE.  Currently requiring pressors and IABP, settings
   currently being weaned.  Likely has low baseline BP and has adequate
   end-organ perfusion with SBP in 70s
   - wean IABP, d/c as possible
   - wean phenylephrine and change to levophed as needed, keeping MAP > 55
   - monitor for cx of IABP i.e. limb ischemia, cholesterol emboli, CVA,
   etc
   - cont to cycle CE
   # CORONARIES: s/p cath yest revealing triple vessel dx with BMS to mid
   and ostial LAD.  Tolerated procedure well with no cx.  No further
   recurrence of anginal sx.
   -cycle CE
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   -hold B-blocker and lisinopril in setting of low BP
   -continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # HAP: left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, cough, new O2 requirement
   (increased slightly since [**Hospital **] transfer from 4 to 6L).  Afebrile with no
   leukocytosis although pt at high risk of infection with
   immunocompromised status
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - send repeat sputum cx
   - f/u final read CXR

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient was transferred from another hospital to the CCU for cardiac catheterization in the setting of unstable angina.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and received two bare metal stents at the ostia (8mm) and proximal (15mm) left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He experienced cardiogenic shock with a blood pressure of 60s prior to PCI, and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed. Heparin was started 6 hours after the removal of the right femoral arterial sheath.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 83/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is still receiving pressors and IABP support, with the settings being weaned overnight from 1.2 to 0.8.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar rales, decreased breath sounds on the left lower lobe, and a harsh systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yoM with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, ESRD, CAD,
   CHF and AS transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] to CCU in anticipation of cardiac cath
   in setting of unstable angina.
   # Hypotension: most consistent with cardiogenic shock.  Etiology
   unknown: no sx of ischemia (CE flat); mechanical complication- i.e.
   acute valvular pathology, septal defect, etc; tamponade; PE.  Currently
   requiring pressors and IABP although settings currently being weaned.
   Likely has low baseline BP and has adequate end-organ perfusion with
   SBP in 70s
   - wean IABP, d/c as possible
   - wean phenylephrine, keeping MAP > 60
   - monitor for cx of IABP esp. peripheral pulses
   - cycle CE
   # CORONARIES: s/p cath yest revealing triple vessel dx with BMS to mid
   and ostial LAD.  Tolerated procedure well with no cx.  No further
   recurrence of anginal sx.
   -cycle CE
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   -hold B-blocker and lisinopril in setting of low BP
   -continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR, although admitted in afib. Rate control
   appears suboptimal, and may be contributing to chest pain. On dual
   antiplatelet therapy; not anticoagulated given underlying hematologic
   malignancy.
   - hold b-blocker in light of cardiogenic shock
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with
   crackles on exam. Patient has had intermittent hypotension throughout
   his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS.
   - continue digoxin and low-dose beta blocker as tolerated
   - would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension,
   although patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far
   - cont dialysis MWF for overall fluid management
   # hypoxia: Exact etiology unclear; potentially multifactorial in
   setting of possible atelectasis, small pleural effusions. 02
   requirement has increased slightly since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) Patient
   remains without any pulmonary symptoms or evidence of infection; should
   these develop, low threshold to start antibiotics given increasing
   consolidation on chest film.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - low threshold to consider vanco/Zosyn/levofloxacin if CXR or clinical
   status worsens
   # Follicular lymphoma: Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine,
   bendamustine, and decadron administered. Originally scheduled to
   receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**], but held off due to episode of chest
   pain on the floor.
   -appreciate ongoing oncology input
   -continue close monitoring of K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12
   -allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   # ESRD: On dialysis MWF.
   - dialysis today
   - Appreciate renal input
   - Continue Nephrocape, calcium acetate.
   # Diabetes: Fair control based on lab sugars. QID FS. ISS.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yoM with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, ESRD, CAD,
   CHF and AS transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] to CCU in anticipation of cardiac cath
   in setting of unstable angina.
   # CORONARIES: Patinet's symptoms, ECG changes and probably troponin
   leak are all suggestive of ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment
   of pain is unfortuantely limited by patient's low blood pressure and
   aortic stenosis. He is planned to undergo cardiac catheterization today
   as above.
   -continue metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   -hold lisinopril in setting of low BP
   -continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR, although admitted in afib. Rate control
   appears suboptimal, and may be contributing to chest pain. Would
   consider further uptitration of beta blocker as patient has appeared to
   tolerate well thus far. On dual antiplatelet therapy; not
   anticoagulated given underlying hematologic malignancy.
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with
   crackles on exam. Patient has had intermittent hypotension throughout
   his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS.
   - continue digoxin and low-dose beta blocker as tolerated
   - would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension,
   although patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far
   - cont dialysis MWF for overall fluid management
   # hypoxia: Exact etiology unclear; potentially multifactorial in
   setting of possible atelectasis, small pleural effusions. 02
   requirement has increased slightly since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) Patient
   remains without any pulmonary symptoms or evidence of infection; should
   these develop, low threshold to start antibiotics given increasing
   consolidation on chest film.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - low threshold to consider vanco/Zosyn/levofloxacin if CXR or clinical
   status worsens
   # Follicular lymphoma: Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine,
   bendamustine, and decadron administered. Originally scheduled to
   receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**], but held off due to episode of chest
   pain on the floor.
   -appreciate ongoing oncology input
   -continue close monitoring of K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12
   -dexamethasone 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**], last day today
   -allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   # ESRD: On dialysis MWF. Last dialysis today. Appreciate renal input.
   Continue Nephrocape, calcium acetate.
   # Diabetes: Fair control based on lab sugars. QID FS. ISS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). He was admitted to the CCU in anticipation of cardiac catheterization due to unstable angina.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization today and had two bare metal stents placed at the ostia and proximal left anterior descending artery. He also had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placed due to cardiogenic shock prior to PCI. Heparin was started 6 hours after the removal of the right femoral arterial sheath.

The patient's condition has been relatively stable overnight, with a weaning of neo from 1.2 to 0.8. His platelet count improved from 40 to 91. The IABP was decreased from 1:1 to 2:1 at around 4am. Renal recommendations include hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow.

The patient is currently on several medications, including Plavix 75mg, Asa 325mg, Atorvastatin 80mg, Lisinopril 5mg, Digoxin 0.125 QOD, Nephrocaps, Calcium acetate TID, Metoprolol 12.5mg, Dilaudid 0.5-1.0 q 3hrs PRN, Lorazepam, Acetaminophen, Allopurinol 100mg QOD, Dexamethasone 20 IV x 5 days, and Oxycodone q 6 PRN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary ischemia: The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and troponin leak suggest ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment of pain is limited by the patient's low blood pressure and aortic stenosis.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had intermittent hypotension throughout his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential end-organ damage.
3. Fluid overload: The patient appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with crackles on exam. Fluid overload can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure.
4. Respiratory infection: The patient has an increased requirement for oxygen and small pleural effusions. This could be due to atelectasis or a developing respiratory infection. Close monitoring and early initiation of antibiotics if necessary are important.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been low, increasing the risk of bleeding complications. This should be considered when planning interventions or procedures.
6. Renal function: The patient has ESRD and is on dialysis three times a week."

   73 yoM with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, ESRD, CAD,
   CHF and AS transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] to CCU in anticipation of cardiac cath
   in setting of unstable angina.
   # Hypotension: most consistent with cardiogenic shock likely
   precipitated by small ischemic event although CE flat.  No evidence of
   mechanical complication- i.e. acute valvular pathology, septal defect,
   etc; tamponade; PE.  Currently requiring pressors and IABP, settings
   currently being weaned.  Likely has low baseline BP and has adequate
   end-organ perfusion with SBP in 70s
   - wean IABP, d/c as possible
   - wean phenylephrine and change to levophed as needed, keeping MAP > 55
   - monitor for cx of IABP i.e. limb ischemia, cholesterol emboli, CVA,
   etc
   - cont to cycle CE
   # CORONARIES: s/p cath yest revealing triple vessel dx with BMS to mid
   and ostial LAD.  Tolerated procedure well with no cx.  No further
   recurrence of anginal sx.
   -cycle CE
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk

   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # HAP: left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, cough, new O2 requirement
   (increased slightly since [**Hospital **] transfer from 4 to 6L).  Afebrile with no
   leukocytosis although pt at high risk of infection with
   immunocompromised status
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - send repeat sputum cx
   - f/u final read CXR
   - start cefepime/ vancomycin for 8 day course
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR, although admitted in afib. Rate control
   appears suboptimal, and may be contributing to chest pain. On dual
   antiplatelet therapy; not anticoagulated given underlying hematologic
   malignancy.
   - hold b-blocker in light of cardiogenic shock

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). He was transferred to the CCU in anticipation of cardiac catheterization in the setting of unstable angina.

The patient underwent catheterization and received two bare metal stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). He experienced cardiogenic shock prior to the procedure and had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placed. The heparin infusion was started six hours after the removal of the right femoral arterial sheath.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 83/48 mmHg (67/37 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals bibasilar rales, decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe, and a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border.

The patient's laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 3.4 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, sodium level of 127 mg/dL, potassium level of 4."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain. He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), during which two bare metal stents were placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient experienced cardiogenic shock prior to PCI and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed. He is currently on heparin infusion and being weaned off vasopressors.

The patient has a history of aspirin allergy and upset stomach. His last dose of antibiotics was given on [date]. He is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and phenylephrine. Other ICU medications include [list of medications]. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for chest pain. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/48 mmHg to 90/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals a well-appearing adult male with bibasilar rales and a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.4-7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, creatinine level of 6.5-5.3 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.9-4.1 mEq/L, and sodium level of 139-135 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient's platelet count has improved from 40 to 91. He has a history of lymphoma and is currently on chemotherapy. 

The patient is expected to undergo hemodialysis tomorrow. 

The patient's condition should be closely monitored for any signs of complications related to the recent PCI and IABP placement. These may include bleeding, infection, arrhythmias, and organ dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yoM with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, ESRD, CAD,
   CHF and AS transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] to CCU in anticipation of cardiac cath
   in setting of unstable angina.
   # CORONARIES: Patinet's symptoms, ECG changes and probably troponin
   leak are all suggestive of ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment
   of pain is unfortuantely limited by patient's low blood pressure and
   aortic stenosis. He is planned to undergo cardiac catheterization today
   as above.
   -continue metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   -hold lisinopril in setting of low BP
   -continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR, although admitted in afib. Rate control
   appears suboptimal, and may be contributing to chest pain. Would
   consider further uptitration of beta blocker as patient has appeared to
   tolerate well thus far. On dual antiplatelet therapy; not
   anticoagulated given underlying hematologic malignancy.
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with
   crackles on exam. Patient has had intermittent hypotension throughout
   his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS.
   - continue digoxin and low-dose beta blocker as tolerated
   - would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension,
   although patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far
   - cont dialysis MWF for overall fluid management
   # hypoxia: Exact etiology unclear; potentially multifactorial in
   setting of possible atelectasis, small pleural effusions. 02
   requirement has increased slightly since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) Patient
   remains without any pulmonary symptoms or evidence of infection; should
   these develop, low threshold to start antibiotics given increasing
   consolidation on chest film.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - low threshold to consider vanco/Zosyn/levofloxacin if CXR or clinical
   status worsens
   # Follicular lymphoma: Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine,
   bendamustine, and decadron administered. Originally scheduled to
   receive rituximab on [**2151-1-9**], but held off due to episode of chest
   pain on the floor.
   -appreciate ongoing oncology input
   -continue close monitoring of K, phos, LDH, uric acid Q12
   -dexamethasone 20 mg IV x 5 days started [**1-7**], last day today
   -allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD
   # ESRD: On dialysis MWF. Last dialysis today. Appreciate renal input.
   Continue Nephrocape, calcium acetate.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). He was transferred to the CCU in anticipation of cardiac catheterization due to unstable angina.

The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and troponin leak suggest ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment of pain is limited by the patient's low blood pressure and aortic stenosis. He underwent cardiac catheterization today and had two bare metal stents placed at the ostia and proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was also placed due to cardiogenic shock prior to PCI. Heparin was started 6 hours after removing the right femoral arterial sheath.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 101 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure of 83/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Now off balloon pump and pressors.  Echocardiogram shows no change in
   LV function.  His aortic stenosis is of the low-flow low-gradient type
   that might lessen with increased LV stroke work that I hope will result
   from the LAD PCI.  I spent a good deal of time discussing with [**Known firstname **] and
   his family his overall poor prognosis and the limited goals of his PCI
   (primarly symptom releif but also hoping to lessen hypotension during
   HD).  Also discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6521**] and [**Doctor Last Name 1788**] today.  We will plan
   to transfer [**Known firstname **] back to the O-med service once completely stable
   cardiac-wise for > 24 h.
   He will require resolution of his pneumonia before resuming
   chemotherapy.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]  on:[**2151-1-14**]
   14:07 ------
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient was transferred to the CCU in anticipation of cardiac catheterization due to unstable angina.

The patient has undergone a few interventions and changes in treatment:

1. The patient's IABP line was stopped on 01/13/2151 at 04:00 PM.
2. The patient was started on cefepime/vancomycin for suspected pneumonia based on the chest X-ray findings.
3. Neo (norepinephrine) was weaned off and replaced with levo (levophed) at a lower dose.
4. The balloon pump was removed, and the patient showed improvement in spirits afterwards.
5. The attending nephrologist discussed the possibility of re-orienting the goals of care towards comfort, which made the family upset. However, after the balloon pump removal, the patient expressed determination to make a full recovery.
6. The patient received hemodialysis overnight to clear contrast infused during cardiac catheterization.
7. The patient's antibiotic regimen included vancomycin and cefepime, with the last doses administered on 01/13/2151 at 11:00 AM and 01/13/2151 at 01:00 PM, respectively.
8. The patient is currently on norepinephrine infusion at 0.08 mcg/kg/min.
9. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/51 to 77/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
10. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-appearing adult male with clear lungs, no jugular venous distention, and a mildly tachycardic heart with regular rhythm. A harsh systolic murmur is heard best at the left upper sternal border.
11. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine levels.
12. The patient's chest X-ray shows improved opacities in the left perihilar and lingular regions.
13. The patient's oncology treatment includes oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron, which he is currently receiving.
14. The patient's ESRD management includes dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and medication adjustments.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count indicate a risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory symptoms or fever is important.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the bleeding risk,"

   - hold off on ACI and BB for now until sBP is over 100
   - would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension,
   although patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far

   appears suboptimal, and may be contributing to chest pain. On dual
   antiplatelet therapy; not anticoagulated given underlying hematologic
   malignancy.
   - will give BB once BP can tolerate
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with
   crackles on exam. Patient has had intermittent hypotension throughout
   his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS.
   - continue digoxin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient was transferred from another hospital to the CCU in anticipation of cardiac catheterization due to unstable angina.

The patient has undergone two stenting procedures in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and is currently doing well without any further chest pain. The current issues include hypotension, rhythm disturbances, pump dysfunction, hypoxia, and ongoing treatment for follicular lymphoma.

The patient's blood pressure has been stable, with systolic blood pressure ranging from 111 to 77 mmHg. The patient is no longer on pressors or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). An echocardiogram has been ordered today.

The patient's heart rhythm has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), although they were admitted in atrial fibrillation (AFib). Rate control appears suboptimal, which may contribute to chest pain. The patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy and is not anticoagulated due to underlying hematologic malignancy. Once the patient's blood pressure can tolerate, beta-blockers (BB) will be given.

The patient appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with crackles on examination. The patient has had intermittent hyp"

   73 yoM with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, ESRD, CAD,

   # CORONARIES: Patinet's symptoms, ECG changes and probably troponin
   leak are all suggestive of ongoing coronary ischemia. Acute treatment
   of pain is unfortuantely limited by patient's low blood pressure and
   aortic stenosis. He is planned to undergo cardiac catheterization today
   as above.
   -continue metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -continue digoxin for rate and symptom control
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel for now with understanding that patient's
   thrombocytopenia likely increases bleeding risk
   -hold lisinopril in setting of low BP
   -continue IV dilaudid PRN for pain control as BP tolerates
   -could consider initiation of an antianginal such as ranolizine, which
   may have less preload effect than nitrates, although this would still
   need to be done cautiously given baseline low blood pressures and ESRD
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR, although admitted in afib. Rate control
   appears suboptimal, and may be contributing to chest pain. Would
   consider further uptitration of beta blocker as patient has appeared to
   tolerate well thus far. On dual antiplatelet therapy; not
   anticoagulated given underlying hematologic malignancy.
   # PUMP: Overall appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with
   crackles on exam. Patient has had intermittent hypotension throughout
   his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS.
   - continue digoxin and low-dose beta blocker as tolerated
   - would consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension,
   although patient has not been symptomatic with this thus far
   - cont dialysis MWF for overall fluid management
   # hypoxia: Exact etiology unclear; potentially multifactorial in
   setting of possible atelectasis, small pleural effusions. 02
   requirement has increased slightly since ICU transfer (4 to 6L) Patient
   remains without any pulmonary symptoms or evidence of infection; should
   these develop, low threshold to start antibiotics given increasing
   consolidation on chest film.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - low threshold to consider vanco/Zosyn/levofloxacin if CXR or clinical
   status worsens
   # Follicular lymphoma: Patient is in middle of cycle of oncovine,

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, CHF, and AS, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
2. Infection: The patient is on immunosuppressive therapy for his lymphoma, which increases the risk of infection. Additionally, the use of central lines and dialysis catheters can introduce potential sources of infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, particularly with the concurrent use of antiplatelet agents.
4. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD and is on dialysis, which requires careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient may be at risk for respiratory infections or atelectasis due to his immobilized state and underlying lung disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). He was transferred to the CCU in anticipation of cardiac catheterization due to unstable angina. The patient has been doing well without chest pain since then. His current medications include aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: The patient has two bare-metal stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and is currently stable without chest pain. Continue aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel therapy, understanding that the patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding. Consider adding a beta-blocker if blood pressure improves.

2. Hypotension: The patient is now off pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Blood pressure is stable in the 90s. Get an echocardiogram today. Hold off on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta-blocker until systolic blood pressure is over 100. Consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension.

3. Rhythm: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm, although admitted with atrial fibrillation. Rate control appears suboptimal and may be contributing to chest pain. He is on dual anti"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). He was admitted to the ICU due to unstable angina. The patient has undergone a cardiac catheterization and is currently off pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). His blood pressure is stable in the 90s, and he is expected to continue ASA, statin, and clopidogrel therapy. 

The patient's rhythm is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), but he has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib). Rate control appears suboptimal, which may contribute to chest pain. He is on dual antiplatelet therapy and not anticoagulated due to his underlying hematologic malignancy. 

In terms of fluid management, the patient appears fairly euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic with crackles on examination. He has had intermittent hypotension throughout his course, likely related to poor forward flow from CHF/AS. Digoxin therapy will be continued, and dialysis will be performed on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for overall fluid management.

The patient is in the middle of a cycle of chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma and is currently receiving oncovine, bendamustine, and decadron. Rituximab was initially"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis (AS). He was admitted to the CCU in anticipation of cardiac catheterization for unstable angina. The patient had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stents (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). His current medications include aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: Continue ASA, statin, and clopidogrel. Consider adding beta-blocker if blood pressure improves.
2. Hypotension: The patient is now off pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Blood pressure is stable in the 90s. Get echo today and hold off on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) and beta-blocker until systolic blood pressure (sBP) is over 100. Consider small fluid boluses as needed for hypotension.
