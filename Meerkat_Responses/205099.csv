   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo female with h/o HTN, DM, OSA--s/p trach for Rx and now with
   return admission from medical floor following brief stay in ICU
   initially.  She now, on the medical floor had FIO2 weaned successfully,
   she had Lasix dosing continued on the floor.  In addition, she had
   hypoxemia transiently overnight which improved wtih oxygen support
   replaced.  ABG across the night had evidence of significant hypercarbia
   in the setting of sleep and recent diuresis with significant elevations
   in HCO3-.  Given worsening in PCO2 patient to ICU for further care.
   Upon review of events overnight patient had significant contraction
   alkalosis in the setting of lasix patient has evolved significant
   metabolic contraction and elevations in PCO2.  In addition
patient does
   have persistent elevation in RR which is in the setting of poor air
   movement with each breath consistent with inadequate ventilation.  This
   may be related to drive and inability to effectively  ventilate
   1)Respiratory Failure-Will not have rapid correction to normal PCO2
   without support given persistent elevation in the setting of rapid
   shallow breathing at this time.
   -Will change to cuffed trach and provide ventilatory support until
   stabilized
   -Will continue to correct serum HCO3---with hold of Lasix and start of
   diamox
   -Will ventilate to goal PCO2 of 70-80 at maximum

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and had a tracheostomy performed. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with significant elevations in PCO2 (hypercarbia) and an increase in HCO3- levels. The patient also experienced a contraction alkalosis due to diuretic use. The patient's respiratory rate is persistently elevated, indicating inadequate ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent elevation in PCO2 suggests ongoing respiratory failure. Without ventilatory support, there may be a rapid shallow breathing pattern, making it difficult to correct the abnormal PCO2 levels.

Plan of Care:
1. Change to cuffed tracheostomy tube and provide ventilatory support until stabilized.
2. Hold Lasix and start diamox to correct serum HCO3- levels.
3. Ventilate to goal PCO2 of 70-80 at maximum.
4. Continue monitoring and managing other aspects of ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP precautions."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 yo female with diastolic CHF, s/p trach, HTN, DM, A. fib
   on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation now with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant, though patient
   does have obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  No clear evidence of
   infiltrate or other infectious process.  Patient has also been
   aggressively diursed on this admission so doubt that pulmonary edema is
   contributing significantly at this point.  FiO2 weaned to 35%, her
   baseline, this morning.  Most likely her metabolic alkalosis from
   diuresis has lead to decreased respiratory drive with subsequent
   ineffective ventilation leading to hypercarbia.
   - cont. acetazolamide
   - increase KCl repletion to goal of 4.5
   - arginine chloride 30g x 1 today
   - recheck lytes this evening
   - consider change out trach to cuffed trach & putting on vent overnight
   if unable to decrease HCO3
   - Hold further diuresis for now
   .
   # Hypoxia: Most likely related to decreased respiratory drive.  Event
   on the floor in the setting of being off trach mask overnight.  Also,
   as above, has decreased ventilatory drive and possibly ineffective
   oxygenation.  Has been treated for CHF exacerbation with aggressive
   diuresis with improved oxygenation over the last several days.  Sputum
   sample not suggestive of active infection.
   - Hold on further lasix diuresis for now given contraction alkalosis
   - Chest pt
   - Cxr after diuresis to look for infiltrate as above
   - Follow WBC, fever
   - Albuterol, atrovent nebs
   .
   # Anemia:  At baseline.  Most recent anemia studies in [**Month (only) 102**] c/w
   iron deficiency anemia.  Prior [**Last Name (un) **] shows diverticulosis.
   - iron supplementaion
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  unchanged
   - follow Na
   - encourage free water PO, hold on any IV free water
   .
   # Renal failure:  Fluctuating baseline, but currently lower than on
   discharge in spite of diuresis
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CAD:  Positive tropnonin with normal ck, likely demand in setting of
   renal dysfunction. NO acute ekg changes.
   - ruled out for MI
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets now actually increased.  Unclear
   etiology, but has had precipitous decline over last few weeks.  Perhaps
   secondary to med effect.  Does not appear to be on heparin at rehab.
   - trend platelets
   .
   # H/o A. fib:  On coumadin initially here with supratherapeutic INR.
   Now subtherapeutic.
   - Restart coumadin
   .
   # HTN:
   - lisinopril
   .
   # Breast cancer:
   - Arimidex
   .
   # Gout:
   - continue colchicine
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet - npo for now while
   somnolent
   .
   Prophylaxis: dc subq heparin, restart coumadin as above, no indication
   for ppi
   .
   Access: peripherals

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, tracheostomy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation now with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been aggressively diuresed on this admission and is currently experiencing hypercarbia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to effectively ventilate has led to an accumulation of carbon dioxide in her blood, resulting in hypercarbia. This condition can worsen her respiratory status and may require mechanical ventilation support.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing decreased oxygenation due to her ineffective ventilation. This can lead to tissue hypoxia and further complications if not addressed.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The aggressive diuresis may have caused a metabolic alkalosis, which can decrease respiratory drive and contribute to ineffective ventilation.
4. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia, which may be contributing to her overall poor condition.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, indicating possible dehydration or imbalances in her fluid and electrolyte levels.
6. Renal failure: The patient's fluctuating baseline renal function suggests possible renal dysfunction, which can further complicate her condition.
7. Cardiac abnormalities: The presence of positive troponin and CK suggests"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 yo female with diastolic CHF, s/p trach, HTN, DM, A. fib
   on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation now with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant.  No clear
   evidence of infiltrate or other infectious process.  She apparently had
   been requiring increased oxygen supplementation over the last 24 hours
   and had been off her trach mask during part of the night.  Currently,
   FiO2 has been at 70% which she had been tolerating up until this
   point.  Also has metabolic alkalosis likely due to aggressive diuresis
   leading to contraction alkalosis.  In that setting, patient likely has
   decreased respiratory drive with subsequent ineffective ventilation
   leading to hypercarbia.
   - Will change out trach to cuffed trach
   - BiPAP to improved PCO2 and decrease HCO3 to baseline
   - Hold further diuresis for now
   - Repeat CXR now post diuresis to see if there has been any improvement
   or worsening
   .
   # Hypoxia: Most recent episode was in the setting of being off trach
   mask overnight.  Also, as above, has decreased ventilatory drive and
   possibly ineffective oxygenation.  Has been treated for CHF
   exacerbation with aggressive diuresis with improved oxygenation over
   the last several days.  Also, continuing to have pulmonary secretions,
   though still afebrile and without leukocytosis to suggest pna.  Initial
   sputum sample with oropharyngeal flora.
   - Send sputum cx if develops fever, wbc, increased pulmonary secretions
   - Hold on further lasix diuresis for now given contraction alkalosis
   - Chest pt
   - Cxr after diuresis to look for infiltrate as above
   - Follow WBC, fever
   - Albuterol, atrovent nebs
   .
   # Anemia:  At baseline.  Most recent anemia studies in [**Month (only) 102**] c/w
   iron deficiency anemia.  Prior [**Last Name (un) **] shows diverticulosis.
   - iron supplementaion
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - follow Na
   - encourage free water PO, hold on any IV free water
   .
   # Renal failure:  Fluctuating baseline, but currently lower than on
   discharge in spite of diuresis
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CAD:  Positive tropnonin with normal ck, likely demand in setting of
   renal dysfunction. NO acute ekg changes.
   - ruled out for MI
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology, but has had precipitous decline
   over last few weeks.  Perhaps secondary to med effect.  Does not appear
   to be on heparin at rehab.
   - trend platelets
   .
   # H/o A. fib:  On coumadin initially here with supratherapeutic INR.
   Now subtherapeutic.
   - Restart coumadin
   .
   # HTN:
   - lisinpril
   .
   # Breast cancer:

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation now with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely due to aggressive diuresis leading to contraction alkalosis. The patient likely has decreased respiratory drive with subsequent ineffective ventilation leading to hypercarbia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to effectively ventilate has resulted in high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Hypoxia: The patient experienced an episode of low oxygen levels while being off the tracheostomy mask overnight.
3. Contraction alkalosis: The aggressive diuresis has caused a decrease in blood volume, resulting in an increase in blood bicarbonate levels.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia and diverticulosis.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating possible dehydration.
6. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is fluctuating and is currently lower than on discharge despite diuresis.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to medication effects or other causes.
8. Cardiac arrest: The patient"

   78 yo female with significant obesity/hypoventilation who now has
   persistent ventilatory failure in the setting of ""compensated"" pH.
   This may be driven by significant hypercarbia across the night and with
   diurnal presence of significant elevations in HCO3- she has a drive to
   keep PCO2 only at 85-90 which is unacceptable.  She has need to correct
   severe metabolic alkalosis and will move through Diamox and Arginine Cl
   to correct metabolic alkalosis and hope to see full continued increase
   in ventilatory drive.
   1)respiratory Failure-
   -Correct Metabolic Alkalosis
   -Will move to PSV support as needed
   -Do not see current evidence of significant new overwhelming infection
   or pulmonary edema so expect good response to correction metabolic

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with significant obesity who has respiratory failure. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation support. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 85, and HCO3- of 51, indicating respiratory failure with hypercarbia and metabolic alkalosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate between 76-92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/40-159/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently has persistent ventilatory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. There is a need to correct severe metabolic alkalosis, and the plan is to move to pressure support ventilation (PSV) as needed.

2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has an elevated bicarbonate level of 51, indicating metabolic alkalosis. This condition needs to be corrected using medications such as diamox and arginine chloride to increase ventilatory drive.

3. Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows growth of Proteus and gram-positive cocci, suggesting a possible infection. Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be initiated based on the culture results.

4. Pulmonary Edema: There is no current evidence"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 yo female with diastolic CHF, s/p trach, HTN, DM, A. fib
   on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation now with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant, though patient
   does have obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  No clear evidence of
   infiltrate or other infectious process.  Patient has also been
   aggressively diursed on this admission so doubt that pulmonary edema is
   contributing significantly at this point.  FiO2 weaned to 35%, her
   baseline, and patient stable on this for over 24H.  Most likely her
   metabolic alkalosis from diuresis lead to decreased respiratory drive
   with subsequent ineffective ventilation leading to hypercarbia.
   Hypercarbia and metabolic alkalosis improved after potassium chloride,
   diamox, and arginine chloride.
   - cont. acetazolamide today
 250 mg TID
   - recheck lytes this evening
   - consider change out trach to cuffed trach & putting on vent overnight
   if unable to decrease HCO3
   - Hold further diuresis for now
   .
   # Hypoxia: Most likely related to decreased respiratory drive.  Event
   on the floor in the setting of being off trach mask overnight.  Also,
   as above, has decreased ventilatory drive and possibly ineffective
   oxygenation.  Has been treated for CHF exacerbation with aggressive
   diuresis with improved oxygenation over the last several days.  Sputum
   sample not suggestive of active infection.
   - Hold on further lasix diuresis for now given contraction alkalosis
   - Chest pt
   - Cxr after diuresis to look for infiltrate as above
   - Follow WBC, fever
   - Albuterol, atrovent nebs
   .
   # Anemia:  At baseline.  Most recent anemia studies in [**Month (only) 102**] c/w
   iron deficiency anemia.  Prior [**Last Name (un) **] shows diverticulosis.
   - iron supplementaion
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  unchanged
   - follow Na
   - encourage free water PO, hold on any IV free water
   .
   # Renal failure:  Fluctuating baseline, but currently lower than on
   discharge in spite of diuresis
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CAD:  Positive tropnonin with normal ck, likely demand in setting of
   renal dysfunction. NO acute ekg changes.
   - ruled out for MI

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and congestive heart failure exacerbation. She is now experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her current condition includes obesity hypoventilation syndrome, unclear precipitant, no clear evidence of infiltrate or infectious process. She has been aggressively diuresed on this admission, and it is doubtful that pulmonary edema is contributing significantly. The patient's metabolic alkalosis from diuresis has likely led to decreased respiratory drive with subsequent ineffective ventilation leading to hypercarbia. Hypercarbia and metabolic alkalosis improved after potassium chloride, diamox, and arginine chloride. She is currently stable on FiO2 weaned to 35%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ineffective ventilation and decreased respiratory drive have resulted in an accumulation of carbon dioxide in her blood, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure. If not managed properly, this condition can lead to further respiratory acidosis, increased carbon dioxide levels, and potential brain damage.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's decreased respiratory drive and ineffective oxygenation have resulted in low levels of oxygen in her blood, leading to hypoxia. If left untreated, this can cause tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

3. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia, which needs to be"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 yo female with diastolic CHF, s/p trach, HTN, DM, A. fib
   on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation now with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant, though patient
   does have obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  No clear evidence of
   infiltrate or other infectious process.  Patient has also been
   aggressively diuresed on this admission so doubt that pulmonary edema
   is contributing significantly at this point.  FiO2 weaned to 35%, her
   baseline, and patient stable on this for over 24H.  Most likely her
   metabolic alkalosis from diuresis lead to decreased respiratory drive
   with subsequent ineffective ventilation leading to hypercarbia.
   Hypercarbia and metabolic alkalosis improved after potassium chloride,
   diamox, and arginine chloride.
   - cont. acetazolamide today
 250 mg TID
   - recheck lytes this evening
   - consider change out trach to cuffed trach & putting on vent overnight
   if unable to decrease HCO3
   - Hold further diuresis for now
   .
   # Hypoxia: Resolved.  Patient now back to baseline O2 requirement.
   Event on the floor in the setting of being off trach mask overnight.
   Also, as above, has decreased ventilatory drive and possibly
   ineffective oxygenation.  Has been treated for CHF exacerbation with
   aggressive diuresis with improved oxygenation over the last several
   days.  Sputum sample not suggestive of active infection.
   - Hold on further lasix diuresis for now given contraction alkalosis
   and elevated creatinine

   # Hypernatremia:  unchanged
   - follow Na
   - encourage free water PO, hold on any IV free water

   # Renal failure:  Elevated from 1.2 to 1.6 this morning, likely related
   to dehydration given concomitant oliguria.  Received IVF overnight.
   - follow Cr
   - additional IVF if necessary

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, tracheostomy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and congestive heart failure exacerbation now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Aggressive diuresis may have contributed to decreased respiratory drive and subsequent ineffective ventilation. The patient's metabolic alkalosis improved after potassium chloride, diamox, and arginine chloride. She will continue taking acetazolamide and her tracheostomy may be changed to a cuffed tracheostomy with consideration for nighttime ventilation if hypercarbia does not improve.

2. Hypoxia: The patient had resolved hypoxia, but experienced it again while off the tracheostomy mask overnight. This could be due to decreased ventilatory drive and possibly ineffective oxygenation. Treatment for congestive heart failure exacerbation with aggressive diuresis has improved oxygenation over the last several days. Sputum sample does not suggest active infection. Further diuresis is being held, and albuterol and atrovent nebs may be used.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is at baseline, with recent studies showing iron deficiency anemia. Prior"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, tracheostomy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. She was admitted with hypoxia and congestive heart failure exacerbation and is now experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64/46 to 159/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on tracheostomy mask. The patient has poor inspiratory effort and rhonchi in the lungs, along with irregular heart rhythm. 

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and increased potassium levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but her liver enzymes and creatinine levels are slightly elevated. Her electrolytes are also imbalanced, with low sodium and magnesium levels, as well as high phosphate levels. 

The patient's plan includes continuing acetazolamide, increasing potassium chloride repletion, administering arginine chloride, and rechecking electrolytes. The possibility of changing the tracheostomy to a cuffed tracheostomy and putting her on mechanical ventilation is being considered if there is no improvement in her bicarbonate levels. Further diuresis is being held due to metabolic alkalosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo female with history of obesity and OSA--s/p trach--who is
   admitted to ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure and has clear
   evidence of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of diuresis.  She has
   had some improvement in PCO2 with partial correction of metabolic
   alkalosis with Cl replacement.  ABG was 7.37/77/75 and HCO3-improve to
   40.  Her recent course is complicated by oliguria and concern for
   worsening renal failure which may well be pre-renal azotemia.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Some improvement in ventilation with correction
   of metabolic alkalosis.  Will provide continued support for both
   hypercarbia and metabolic alkalosis
   -Will provide NS to replace volume which does appear to be deplete
   -24 more hours diamox
   -Will use ABG
s to consider NIV support
   -Will need to consider long term nocturnal ventilatory support for care
   for her
   2)Hypoxemia
patient at baseline FIO2 requirement
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Will have to evaluate for possible pre-renal source of failure
   -Provide small volume saline today
   -Check urine lytes
   4)altered mental status-
   -Will have to follow exam today
   -replace hearing aid
   -Is concerning decrease in altertness but may be related to metabolic
   picture and will have to consider eval further

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has shown some improvement in ventilation with the partial correction of metabolic alkalosis, but her recent course is complicated by oliguria and concern for worsening renal failure, which may be pre-renal azotemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has shown some improvement with the correction of metabolic alkalosis. However, continued support for both hypercarbia and metabolic alkalosis is required. This includes providing normal saline to replace volume depletion, continuing diamox, and considering noninvasive ventilation (NIV) support. Long-term nocturnal ventilatory support may also need to be considered for her care.

2) Hypoxemia: The patient requires baseline FiO2 to manage her hypoxemia.

3) Acute Renal Failure: There is a concern for possible pre-renal causes of renal failure. The patient will need to be evaluated for this, and small volume saline will be provided. Checking urine electrolytes will also be important.

4) Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status should be closely monitored. A thorough examination will be conducted, and her hearing aid will be replaced. A decrease in alertness may be related to her metabolic picture, but further evaluation is necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, atrial flutter, chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic respiratory failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/52 to 130/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is receiving IV fluids and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated if signs of infection are present.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered to prevent this complication.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers should be used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
4. Nosocomial infections: Due to the invasive lines and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic renal failure, atrial flutter, anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/52 to 130/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,117 mL and output of 1,070 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,047 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (1.2-1.6 mg/dL), glucose (98-166 mg/dL), and lactic acid (0.7 mmol/L). The patient's WBC count is within normal range, but Hct and Plt levels are slightly lower than previous readings. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, atrial flutter, anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient's family is concerned about nursing care at a specific hospital and the potential for ""acting out"" and not participating in rehabilitation if transferred there.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient's chronic renal failure may progress further, leading to decreased urine"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 yo female with diastolic CHF, s/p trach, HTN, DM, A. fib
   on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation now with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant, though patient
   does have obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  No clear evidence of
   infiltrate or other infectious process.  Patient has also been
   aggressively diuresed on this admission so doubt that pulmonary edema
   is contributing significantly at this point.  FiO2 weaned to 35%, her
   baseline, and patient stable on this for over 24H.  Most likely her
   metabolic alkalosis from diuresis lead to decreased respiratory drive
   with subsequent ineffective ventilation leading to hypercarbia.
   Hypercarbia and metabolic alkalosis improved after potassium chloride,
   diamox, and arginine chloride.
   - cont. acetazolamide today
 250 mg TID
   .
   # Hypoxia: Resolved.  Patient now back to baseline O2 requirement.
   Event on the floor in the setting of being off trach mask overnight.
   Also, as above, has decreased ventilatory drive and possibly
   ineffective oxygenation.  Has been treated for CHF exacerbation with
   aggressive diuresis with improved oxygenation over the last several
   days.  Sputum sample not suggestive of active infection.
   - Hold on further lasix diuresis for now given contraction alkalosis
   and elevated creatinine
   - Chest pt
   - Albuterol, atrovent nebs
   .
   # Renal insufficiency:  Improved from 1.6 to 1.4, likely related to
   dehydration given concomitant oliguria.  Received IVF with improvement
   in UOP and Cr.
   - follow Cr
   - additional IVF if necessary
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia:  At baseline and stable.  Most recent anemia studies in
   [**Month (only) 102**] c/w iron deficiency anemia.  Prior [**Last Name (un) **] shows diverticulosis.
   - iron supplementaion
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  stable
   - follow Na
   - encourage free water PO, hold on any IV free water
   .
   # CAD:  Positive tropnonin with normal ck, likely demand in setting of
   renal dysfunction. NO acute ekg changes. Ruled out for MI
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.  Unclear etiology, but has had
   precipitous decline over last few weeks.  Perhaps secondary to med
   effect.  Does not appear to be on heparin at rehab.
   - trend platelets
   .
   # H/o A. fib:  Restarted coumadin and now therapeutic.
   - Cont coumadin, follow PT/INR
   .
   # HTN:
   - Cont lisinopril as renal function improving
   .
   # Breast cancer:
   - Arimidex
   .
   # Gout:
   - continue colchicine
   .
   FEN: replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   Prophylaxis: therapeutic on coumadin, no indication for ppi
   .
   Access: peripherals
   .
   Code: full, confirmed with patient and HCP
   .
   Communication: Patient, sister [**Name (NI) 8504**] [**Name (NI) 1000**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8505**],
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8506**]; need to discuss with family possible need for
   ventillatory  support at night.
   .
   Dispo: consider direct discharge to pulmonary rehab. Will discuss with
   case management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. She was admitted with hypoxia and congestive heart failure exacerbation, now with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been aggressively diuresed on this admission, leading to decreased respiratory drive and subsequent ineffective ventilation resulting in hypercarbia. Her hypoxia has resolved, but she still requires assistance with ventilation. The patient's renal insufficiency has improved, likely related to dehydration. She also has anemia, hypernatremia, and thrombocytopenia, which have been addressed accordingly. The patient's conditions include coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, breast cancer, and gout. She is being treated with multiple medications, including coumadin, simvastatin, lisinopril, Arimidex, and colchicine. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer has been provided. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is being considered for direct discharge to pulmonary rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ineffective ventilation may lead to an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood, resulting in hypercarbic respiratory failure. This can cause symptoms such as confusion,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 yo female with diastolic CHF, s/p trach, HTN, DM, A. fib
   on coumadin, admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation now with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant, though patient
   does have obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  No clear evidence of
   infiltrate or other infectious process.  Patient has also been
   aggressively diuresed on this admission so doubt that pulmonary edema
   is contributing significantly at this point.  FiO2 weaned to 35%, her
   baseline, and patient stable on this for over 24H.  Most likely her
   metabolic alkalosis from diuresis lead to decreased respiratory drive
   with subsequent ineffective ventilation leading to hypercarbia.
   Hypercarbia and metabolic alkalosis improved after potassium chloride,
   diamox, and arginine chloride.
   - cont. acetazolamide today
 250 mg TID
   .
   # Hypoxia: Resolved.  Patient now back to baseline O2 requirement.
   Event on the floor in the setting of being off trach mask overnight.
   Also, as above, has decreased ventilatory drive and possibly
   ineffective oxygenation.  Has been treated for CHF exacerbation with
   aggressive diuresis with improved oxygenation over the last several
   days.  Sputum sample not suggestive of active infection. Will need
   standing Lasix as outpatient.
   - Hold on further lasix diuresis for now given contraction alkalosis
   and elevated creatinine
   - Chest PT
   - Albuterol, atrovent nebs
   .
   # Renal insufficiency:  Improved from 1.6 to 1.4, likely related to
   dehydration given concomitant oliguria.  Received IVF with improvement
   in UOP and Cr.
   - follow Cr
   - additional IVF if necessary
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia:  At baseline and stable.  Most recent anemia studies in
   [**Month (only) 102**] c/w iron deficiency anemia.  Prior [**Last Name (un) **] shows diverticulosis.
   - iron supplementaion
   - follow HCT
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  stable
   - follow Na
   - encourage free water PO, hold on any IV free water
   .
   # CAD:  Positive tropnonin with normal ck, likely demand in setting of
   renal dysfunction. NO acute ekg changes. Ruled out for MI
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.  Unclear etiology, but has had
   precipitous decline over last few weeks.  Perhaps secondary to med
   effect.  Does not appear to be on heparin at rehab.
   - trend platelets
   .
   # H/o A. fib:  Restarted coumadin and now therapeutic.
   - Cont coumadin, follow PT/INR
   .
   # HTN:
   - Cont lisinopril as renal function improving
   .
   # Breast cancer:
   - Arimidex
   .
   # Gout:
   - continue colchicine
   .

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and breast cancer. She was admitted with hypoxia and CHF exacerbation and now has hypercarbic respiratory failure. The precipitant of hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but the patient has obesity hypoventilation syndrome. There is no evidence of infiltrate or other infectious process, and pulmonary edema is not contributing significantly. The patient has been aggressively diuresed on this admission, leading to metabolic alkalosis from diuresis, which may have caused decreased respiratory drive and subsequent ineffective ventilation leading to hypercarbia.

The patient's hypoxia has resolved, and she is now back to her baseline O2 requirement. She experienced an event on the floor while being off the tracheostomy mask overnight, with decreased ventilatory drive and possible ineffective oxygenation. Treatment for CHF exacerbation with aggressive diuresis has improved oxygenation over the last several days. A sputum sample does not suggest active infection, and she will need standing Lasix as an outpatient. However, further Lasix diuresis should be held due to contraction alkalosis and elevated creatinine.

Renal insufficiency has improved from 1.6 to 1.4, likely related to dehydration given concomitant oliguria. The patient received intravenous fluid"

   78 yo female with CHF and chronic ventilatory failure.  She has had
   improvement to baseline FIO2 and with HCO3- down to what may well be in
   the range of her chronic and compensated respiratory failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Tach mask in place
   -Goal HCO3-=34
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improved creatinine noted with some volume replacement but mainly with
   minimization of diuresis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic ventilatory failure, chronic renal failure, atrial flutter, diabetes mellitus type II, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic anemia. 

The patient's current condition indicates improvement in baseline FiO2 and bicarbonate levels, which may suggest better respiratory function. However, the patient remains on a tach mask and the goal HCO3- level is set at 34. This suggests ongoing respiratory failure.

The patient also exhibits signs of acute renal failure, as evidenced by improved creatinine levels with volume replacement and minimization of diuresis. 

Other medical complications that could arise or may already be present include chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, obstructive sleep apnea, and anemia. These conditions need to be managed and monitored closely during the patient's ICU stay.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/56 to 104/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient has a first-degree AV block.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,117 mL, with outputs including 1,070 mL of urine, 400 mL of drain, and 560 mL of stool. The total fluid"
