   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5141**] is a 73 yo female with PTLD s/p R-CHOP, s/p liver
   transplant in [**2117**] for cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, type
   2 diabetes, and HTN admitted for constellation of non-specific symptoms
   such as fatigue, urinary incontinence, shortness of breath, and leg
   swelling.
   .
   1.  Fatigue.  Unclear if these symptoms truly represent a difference
   from baseline.  No evidence of infection at present so no
   antiobiotics.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to worsening pulmonary fibrosis or to
   RV failure (from pulmonary hypertension).  Patient may benefit from
   trial of sildenafil.
   - Echo to evaluate RV function/pulmonary HTN
   - Is = Os
   - continue home prednisone
   - O2 Sat in high 90s for pulmonary vasodilation
   .
   2.  Tachycardia.  Patient had sinus tachycardia and then A. fib with
   RVR.  HR has increased in recent months at outpatient visits.  Concern
   for ongoing A. fib with RVR as outpatient likely secondary to worsening
   respiratory status.  Normal TSH.  NO evidence of dehydration.
   - increase lopressor dose as tolerated by BP
   .
   3.  IPF.  Patient requires 2-2.5L/NC at home.  On Prednisone 40 mg
   daily.
   - continue steroids
   - continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats > 95
   .
   4.  A.fib.  Patient went into A.fib with RVR.  On metoprolol at home.
   Precipitant for A. fib is likely severe pulmonary disease.  Will give
   IVF in case of dehydration. TSH normal.  CHADS of 3, so would benefit
   from anticoagulation, however, has difficulty walking and questionable
   med compliance.
   - uptitrate lopressor
   - continue aspirin
   - determine why patient is not on anticoagulation
   - f/u with family and/or PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: whether anticoagulation would be
   feasible for patient
   .
   5.  DM. On NPH and RISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   6.  S/p liver transplant, on tacrolimus.
   - check tacrolimus level
   .
   7. Hypothyroidism.
   - check TSH given A. fib

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fatigue. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he was given Lopressor and Diltiazem. He received intravenous fluids and his vital signs are currently stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/63 to 135/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium, metoprolol, and diltiazem. His labs show normal results for WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, and TropT, but slightly elevated levels of glucose and LDH. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination were not assessed due to unknown reasons. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///34/. The patient's medical history includes allergies to codeine, oxycodone/acetaminophen, morphine sulfate, and unknown allergies. The patient's family history, last dose of antibiotics, and other ICU medications are also documented.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o F s/p OLT 3 yrs ago, PTLD, recently diagnosed IPF, who presents
   with LE edema, fever, tachycardia.  Given her underlying lung disease
   and history of RV dilation & hypokinesis on prior echo, this suggests
   RV failure.
   1. Tachycardia:  Has been in sinus tach as well as afib.  Likely being
   driven by worsening RV failure.  Infection is of concern given her
   fever but has been afebrile overnight and no obvious source of
   infection or localizing signs/symptoms. Will continue IV abx till
   cultures negative
   2. Hypotension:  Occurred in ED but resolved and has not been an issue
   overnight.
   3. Right Heart Failure:  Likely acute on chronic, due to underlying
   heart disease.
   - goal euvolemic to slightly negative
   - TTE today
   - may benefit from PSG given body habitus and witnessed snoring.
   4. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-
   -Continue with outpatient medications: on prednisone & prophylactic
   bactrim.
   5. s/p OLT:  Check FK level.
   6. AFib:  Titrate up metoprolol to 25 mg tid.  CHADS2 score 3 so may
   benefit from anticoagulation but will d/w PCP.

","The patient is a 73-year-old female who has a history of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) three years ago, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and recently diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). She presents with left lower extremity edema, fever, tachycardia, and possible right heart failure. 

The patient has been experiencing rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 160s-170s beats per minute (bpm), but it was controlled with diltiazem. Her blood pressure has been stable. 

The patient's past medical history includes chronic kidney disease (CKD), as indicated by her elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. She also has hypercalcemia with a calcium level of 10.4 mg/dL and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.3 mg/dL. 

The patient's physical examination revealed crackles bilaterally on lung auscultation and tachycardia. She has right lower extremity edema and warm skin. Neurological examination was not assessed due to the patient's inability to follow commands.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who has undergone liver transplantation three years ago and has been diagnosed with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). She presents with lower extremity edema, fever, tachycardia, and suspected right heart failure. The patient's medical history includes codeine allergy, oxycodone/acetaminophen (unknown), morphine sulfate (unknown), and various other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely being driven by worsening right ventricular (RV) failure. Infection is also a concern, given the patient's fever. However, no obvious source of infection or localizing signs/symptoms have been identified.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension in the emergency department but has since resolved. It has not been an issue overnight.
3. Right Heart Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute-on-chronic right heart failure due to underlying heart disease. This is supported by her symptoms of lower extremity edema and history of RV dilation and hypokinesis on prior echocardiogram.
4. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: The patient's IPF requires ongoing management with outpatient medications, including prednisone and prophylactic bactrim.

   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
   free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
   level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
   structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
   artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2125-3-9**], the findings are similar.

   difference from baseline. Per patient she is at baseline dyspnea.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be secondary to deconditioning. Currently being covered empirically
   with vanc/levofloxacin (day #2). Cultures pending. Also may be
   component to diastolic dysfunction and known pulmonary fibrosis and
   moderate pulmonary HTN (but not changed from prior per repeat TTE
   yesterday).  Patient weaned back to home O2 dose at 2L NC.
   Hemodynamically stable.
   - continue home prednisone at 40mg PO daily
   - continue vanc/levo (day#2 today) for now, but if cultures negative
   after 24 hours, can consider d/c abx
   .
   2.  s/p Tachycardia.  Patient had sinus tachycardia and then A. fib
   with RVR on day of admission.  HR has increased in recent months at
   outpatient visits.  Concern for ongoing A. fib with RVR with poor RV
   function and possible diastolic dysfunction.  Normal TSH.  No evidence
   of dehydration. Patient
s HR has been well controlled overnight HR
   70-80s on 25mg PO metoprolol. Patient
s BP transiently decreases to SBP
   80s after administration of metoprolol but patient mentating well and
   this is controlling her HR well.
   - continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID for rate control. Can switch to
   12.5mg PO QID if continues to have large transient BP drop after 25mg
   dosing
   - continue aspirin
   - determine why patient is not on anticoagulation
   - f/u with family and/or PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: whether anticoagulation would be
   feasible for patient
   .
   3.  S/p liver transplant, on tacrolimus.
   - check tacrolimus level
   4.  IPF.  Patient requires 2-2.5L/NC at home, currently back on home
   dosing.  On Prednisone 40 mg daily.
   - continue steroids
   - continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats > 95
   .
   5.  DM. On NPH and RISS. NPH uptitrated overnight due to high BS and
   her sugars have been controlled in 100s so far today
   - follow fingersticks
   - continue NPH 30/10 and RISS. Uptitrate as needed.
   .
   6. Hypothyroidism
 TSH normal
   - continue home dose of levothyroxine
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Diabetic diet
   Glycemic Control:  Uncontrolled overnight with highest BS in 400s.
   Evening NPH was increased from 5 to 10 units overnight. Current control

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [**Known lastname 5141**], a 73-year-old female patient with PTLD post R-CHOP and liver transplant for cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and HTN, was admitted for non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, urinary incontinence, shortness of breath, and leg swelling.

The patient's medical history includes a liver transplant in [**2117**], pulmonary fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. She is currently taking multiple medications including tacrolimus, metoprolol, Advair, ASA, Bactrim, prednisone, levothyroxine, and omeprazole.

On admission, the patient was started on empiric antibiotics (vanco/levofloxacin) due to hypothermia and diaphoresis. Blood sugars were elevated, so the evening NPH was increased from 5 to 10 units, and insulin sliding scale was uptitrated. Blood cultures and UCx were pending.

The patient's vital signs on admission included a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 106/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula at 4L. She was hemodynamically stable.

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There
   is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
   free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
   level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
   structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
   artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2125-3-9**], the findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5141**] is a 73 yo female with PTLD s/p R-CHOP, s/p liver
   transplant in [**2117**] for cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, type
   2 diabetes, and HTN admitted for constellation of non-specific symptoms
   such as fatigue, urinary incontinence, shortness of breath, and leg
   swelling.
   .
   1.  Fatigue.  Unclear if these symptoms truly represent a difference
   from baseline.  No evidence of infection at present so no
   antiobiotics.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to worsening pulmonary fibrosis or to
   RV failure (from pulmonary hypertension).  Patient may benefit from
   trial of sildenafil.
   - Echo to evaluate RV function/pulmonary HTN
   - Is = Os
   - continue home prednisone
   - O2 Sat in high 90s for pulmonary vasodilation
   .
   2.  Tachycardia.  Patient had sinus tachycardia and then A. fib with
   RVR.  HR has increased in recent months at outpatient visits.  Concern
   for ongoing A. fib with RVR as outpatient likely secondary to worsening
   respiratory status.  Normal TSH.  NO evidence of dehydration.
   - increase lopressor dose as tolerated by BP
   .
   3.  IPF.  Patient requires 2-2.5L/NC at home.  On Prednisone 40 mg
   daily.
   - continue steroids
   - continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats > 95
   .
   4.  A.fib.  Patient went into A.fib with RVR.  On metoprolol at home.
   Precipitant for A. fib is likely severe pulmonary disease.  Will give
   IVF in case of dehydration. TSH normal.  CHADS of 3, so would benefit
   from anticoagulation, however, has difficulty walking and questionable
   med compliance.
   - uptitrate lopressor
   - continue aspirin
   - determine why patient is not on anticoagulation
   - f/u with family and/or PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: whether anticoagulation would be
   feasible for patient
   .
   5.  DM. On NPH and RISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   6.  S/p liver transplant, on tacrolimus.
   - check tacrolimus level
   .
   7. Hypothyroidism.
   - check TSH given A. fib
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of orthotopic liver transplantation three years ago, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and recently diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). She presents with lower extremity edema, fever, and tachycardia. The patient's condition has shown improvement, but the primary diagnosis remains unclear. There are concerns about infection, superimposed atrial fibrillation, and diastolic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation yesterday but is now back in normal sinus rhythm with improved rate control. However, worsening right ventricular failure is unlikely given the stable transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Hypothermia yesterday raises the possibility of infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient is mildly hypotensive to the 80s after receiving metoprolol. Close monitoring is advised.
3. Right Heart Failure: It is likely acute on chronic due to underlying heart disease. The goal is to achieve euvolemic to slightly negative fluid balance, but the TTE remains unchanged. PSG (positive airway pressure therapy) may be beneficial given the patient's body habitus and witnessed snoring.
4. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: The patient should continue with outpatient medications, including prednisone and prophylactic bactrim.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5141**] is a 73 yo female with PTLD s/p R-CHOP, s/p liver
   transplant in [**2117**] for cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, type
   2 diabetes, and HTN admitted for constellation of non-specific symptoms
   such as fatigue, urinary incontinence, shortness of breath, and leg
   swelling.
   .
   1.  Dyspnea/fatigue.  Unclear if these symptoms truly represent a
   difference from baseline. Per patient she is at baseline dyspnea.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be secondary to deconditioning. Currently being covered empirically
   with vanc/levofloxacin (day #2). Cultures pending. Also may be
   component to diastolic dysfunction and known pulmonary fibrosis and
   moderate pulmonary HTN (but not changed from prior per repeat TTE
   yesterday).  Patient weaned back to home O2 dose at 2L NC.
   Hemodynamically stable.
   - continue home prednisone at 40mg PO daily
   - continue vanc/levo (day#2 today) for now, but if cultures negative
   after 24 hours, can consider d/c abx
   .
   2.  s/p Tachycardia.  Patient had sinus tachycardia and then A. fib
   with RVR on day of admission.  HR has increased in recent months at
   outpatient visits.  Concern for ongoing A. fib with RVR with poor RV
   function and possible diastolic dysfunction.  Normal TSH.  No evidence
   of dehydration. Patient
s HR has been well controlled overnight HR
   70-80s on 25mg PO metoprolol. Patient
s BP transiently decreases to SBP
   80s after administration of metoprolol but patient mentating well and
   this is controlling her HR well.
   - continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID for rate control. Can switch to
   12.5mg PO QID if continues to have large transient BP drop after 25mg
   dosing
   - continue aspirin
   - determine why patient is not on anticoagulation
   - f/u with family and/or PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: whether anticoagulation would be
   feasible for patient
   .
   3.  S/p liver transplant, on tacrolimus.
   - check tacrolimus level
   4.  IPF.  Patient requires 2-2.5L/NC at home, currently back on home
   dosing.  On Prednisone 40 mg daily.
   - continue steroids
   - continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats > 95
   .
   5.  DM. On NPH and RISS. NPH uptitrated overnight due to high BS and
   her sugars have been controlled in 100s so far today
   - follow fingersticks
   - continue NPH 30/10 and RISS. Uptitrate as needed.
   .
   6. Hypothyroidism
 TSH normal
   - continue home dose of levothyroxine

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5141] is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) after R-CHOP, liver transplant in [2117] for cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. She was admitted for non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, urinary incontinence, shortness of breath, and leg swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Fatigue: These symptoms may be secondary to deconditioning, diastolic dysfunction, known pulmonary fibrosis, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been empirically covered with vancomycin and levofloxacin, and cultures are pending. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of these symptoms.

2. Tachycardia: The patient had sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) on the day of admission. There is concern for ongoing AFib with RVR, especially considering poor right ventricular function and possible diastolic dysfunction. The patient's heart rate has been well-controlled overnight with 25mg PO metoprolol, and this medication will be continued for rate control. If the patient continues to experience a large transient blood pressure drop after the 25mg dosing, the dose may be reduced to 12.5mg PO QID.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) three years ago, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and recently diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). She presents with lower extremity edema, fever, and tachycardia. The primary diagnosis is unclear, but it is likely an infection with superimposed atrial fibrillation (AFib) and diastolic dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Right heart failure: The patient has signs of right-sided heart failure, which can be acute on chronic due to underlying heart disease. Monitoring and goal euvolemic to slightly negative fluid balance should be maintained.

2. Hypotension: The patient is mildly hypotensive after receiving metoprolol for rate control. Close monitoring is necessary to manage blood pressure levels.

3. AFib: The patient has AFib, for which metoprolol has been uptitrated to 37.5 mg tid. Considering the CHADS2 score of 3, the patient may benefit from anticoagulation, but further discussion with the primary care physician (PCP) is needed.

4. DM (Diabetes Mellitus): The patient experienced hyperglycemia yesterday, possibly due to infection. With better control on NPH 30 insulin sliding scale, close monitoring of glycemic control"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o F s/p OLT 3 yrs ago, PTLD, recently diagnosed IPF, who presents
   with LE edema, fever, tachycardia.  Overall is improved but unclear
   primary diagnosis.  Likely infection with superimposed AFib & diastolic
   dysfunction.
   1. Tachycardia:  Improved rate control, uptitrating metoprolol.
   - cont metoprolol 37.5 tid
   - cover with antibiotics, cx pending.  d/c vanc as hasn't grown any
   staph.
   2. Hypotension:  Mildly hypotensive to 80s after receiving metoprolol.
   Will monitor.
   3. Right Heart Failure:  Likely acute on chronic, due to underlying
   heart disease.
   - goal euvolemic to slightly negative
   - TTE unchanged
   - may benefit from PSG given body habitus and witnessed snoring.
   4. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-  Doing well, back to home oxygen
   requirement.
   -Continue with outpatient medications: on prednisone & prophylactic
   bactrim.
   5. s/p OLT:  Cont FK 506.
   6. AFib:  Titrated up metoprolol to 37.5 mg tid.  CHADS2 score 3 so may
   benefit from anticoagulation but will d/w PCP.
   7. DM:  Hyperglycemic yesterday, ? if due to infection.  Now better
   controlled on NPH 30 [**Hospital1 **], insulin sliding scale.
