   [**2189-1-23**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
   (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
   [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal
   septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
   minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle.
   Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary
   hypertension. Preserved left ventricular global systolic function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer post-lobectomy, and breast cancer post-lumpectomy. She presents with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple possible etiologies for her respiratory failure, including moderate right pleural effusion, bilateral opacities, and elevated WBC raising suspicion for an infectious process. Other possible causes include total body overload and cardiomegaly concerning for acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), and malignancy contributing to effusion and bilateral opacities. Hypoglycemic episodes are likely contributing to hypercarbia.

The patient's hypoglycemia is improving but remains unexplained. She is currently on a sliding scale of Humalog insulin. The patient has a history of type II diabetes with complications. There are concerns about a right breast mass and skin changes, which could be inflammatory breast cancer or a breast cancer recurrence. An abdominal ultrasound showed a small pocket of ascites, possibly related to heart failure.

The patient's delirium is likely due to a toxic-metabolic cause. She has intermittent SI (safety concerns) and is currently on haloperidol for agitation. Her hypertension is being managed with medication adjustments.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate), and her disposition is pending clinical improvement.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer post lobectomy, and breast cancer post lumpectomy. She presents with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient has multiple potential etiologies for her respiratory failure, including moderate right pleural effusion, bilateral opacities indicating an infectious process, total body overload, and cardiomegaly concerning for acute heart failure. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also a possibility. Additionally, the patient's hypoglycemic episodes may have contributed to the episode of hypercarbia. No evidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is seen, but there might have been a small troponin leak related to demand ischemia. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) supports acute congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient is currently on several medications, including tachycardia and hypoxia treatments, antibiotics for empiric coverage of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and vanc/cefepime for further infection coverage. A right thoracentesis is being considered for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) chest is also recommended to rule out PE, given evidence of right-sided strain on echo and persistent tachycardia and hypoxia. 

The patient's hypoglycemia is improving, and her"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer (s/p lobectomy), and breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy). The patient presents with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has moderate right pleural effusion, bilateral opacities, and elevated WBC raising suspicion for an infectious process. There is also total body overload and cardiomegaly concerning for acute heart failure. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also a possibility. Hypoglycemic episodes may be contributing to the episode of hypercarbia.

2. Hypoglycemia/Type II DM with complications: The patient's hypoglycemia is improving but remains in the 60s. She was on long-acting insulin (Lantus) at NH, with her last dose more than 24 hours prior to admission. It is unclear if there has been a recent medication change. The hypoglycemia could be related to an infectious process, being NPO, or an insulin-producing malignancy. No acute renal failure is present to explain the decrease in insulin requirement.

3. Right Breast Mass and skin changes - concerning for inflammatory breast ca vs breast CA relapse: The patient had a right cyst on [**Last Name (un) **]"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer post lobectomy, and breast cancer post lumpectomy. She presents with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications including cancer (malignant neoplasm), hypoxemia, depression, delirium/confusion, hypertension (benign), and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by leukocytosis on admission and suspicion for an infectious process. The echo also shows moderate pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on echo, but the patient may be at risk for further respiratory complications due to her underlying COPD and lung cancer history.

2. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The echo reveals right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, along with evidence of ascites on abdominal US. This suggests possible left-sided diastolic failure. The patient may be at risk for worsening heart failure symptoms, fluid retention, and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Hypoglycemia/Type II DM with Complications: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus with complications. She is currently improving from hypoglycemia. It is important to monitor her blood sugar levels closely and adjust insulin therapy accordingly.

The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial. There are opacities on the chest X-ray and leukocytosis, suggesting an infectious process. Pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure (RHF) has been noted, but no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on echo.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia, likely contributing to hypercarbia. It is unclear if there have been recent medication changes. There is a possibility of an insulin-producing malignancy or an infectious process causing hypoglycemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer surgery, breast cancer surgery, and depression. The patient presents with altered mental status, hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypoglycemic episodes. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided.

1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis on admission, suspicion for an infectious process, and is receiving empiric coverage for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with vancomycin and cefepime. The presence of fever, increased white blood cell count, and symptoms such as respiratory distress may indicate an ongoing infection.

2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and the presence of increased opacities on chest X-ray suggest a possible COPD exacerbation. The patient is receiving bronchodilators (ipratropium nebs Q6H and albuterol Q2H prn) to manage symptoms.

3. Cardiac issues: The echocardiogram shows moderate pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure (RHF) and no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's enlarged heart and tortuous, calcified aorta seen on chest X-ray indicate possible cardiac problems. The patient is prescribed beta-blockers (bb), ACE inhibitors (ace-i), and statins for heart failure management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer (s/p lobectomy), breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy), and depression. She presents with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical conditions including cancer, hypertension, hypoglycemia, and delirium. She is currently being treated in the ICU for several issues such as hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypoglycemia, right breast mass, abdominal distention, and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing and has low oxygen saturation levels. This could potentially lead to further respiratory distress and complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's echo shows evidence of right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. If left untreated, CHF can progress and lead to worsening heart function, fluid overload, and potentially cardiogenic shock.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently low. If not properly managed, hypoglycemia can cause neurological damage, seizures, and even coma.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is characterized by confusion, disorientation, and changes in mental status. Delir"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's main complaints include anxiety, tachypnea, and abdominal pain. She has been experiencing an increased oxygen requirement of 70% FiO2 after IVFS-ABG showing a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 71, and PaO2 of 151 with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F) and heart rate of 104 bpm. The patient received 40 mg of IV Lasix, resulting in a reduction of oxygen requirement to 4L. The goal for oxygen saturation is set between 90-92%. The patient was also administered IV morphine, Haldol, and olanzapine due to anxiety and tachypnea.

The patient has allergies to no known drugs. She received Vancomycin on 01/24/2189 at 08:18 PM and Cefepime on 01/26/2189 at 03:00 AM. She is currently on infusions of Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), Haloperidol (Haldol), and Morphine Sulfate.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned above. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/98"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer (s/p lobectomy), and breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy). She presents with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical conditions, including cancer, hypertension, depression, delirium/confusion, hypoglycemia, and type II diabetes mellitus with complications.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. She has edema and crackles at the bases of her lungs. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and kidney function markers. Imaging studies reveal opacities on chest X-ray, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and evidence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The most likely cause is acute-on-chronic heart failure with concurrent COPD exacerbation. The patient is receiving Lasix, standing short-acting nebs, and antibiotics for empiric coverage of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

2. CHF: Acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF is evident with right heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and ascites. The patient is holding ACE inhibitors due to elevated creatinine levels and will continue with statin therapy. Lasix is administered as a gentle trickle, and strict intake and output measurements are required."

   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   78 yo female with DM, COPD on 2 liters oxygen, R sided lung Ca s/p
   resection; admitted with acute respiratory distress and tx
d for HAP,
   volume overload
   1. Acute resp distress from COPD/HAP/volume overload: appears improved,
   remains on Vanc/cefipime for HAP to complete  a 8 day course. Would
   hold off on further diuresis as Cr increasing and CT without
   significant pulmonary edema. On atrovent nebs; will wean oxygen
   2. Acute renal failure: could be from aggressive diuresis; onset
   earlier than would be expected for contrast induced nephropathy. Unable
   to assess volume well as pt pulled out Foley; so would give a fluid
   trial
   In ICU for now, consider transfer to floor later today
   Addendum for afternoon- notified by nurse that pt now complaining of
   respiratory distress with oxygen requirement up to 70% FM.
   Possibilities include pulmonary edema as this developed after a fluid
   bolus; also, aspiration. Will check ABG and also  obtain CXR for
   further evaluation. Keep in ICU due to acute respiratory distress,
   pending clarification/resolution.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of right-sided lung cancer status post resection. She was admitted with acute respiratory distress and treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and volume overload.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Acute respiratory distress from COPD/HAP/volume overload: The patient appears improved but remains on vancomycin and cefipime for HAP to complete an 8-day course. Oxygen therapy is being weaned, and atrovent nebs are being used. Further diuresis is being held off due to increasing creatinine levels and the absence of significant pulmonary edema.
2. Acute renal failure: This could be due to aggressive diuresis, and its onset is earlier than expected for contrast-induced nephropathy. The Foley catheter was pulled out, so a fluid trial will be given.
3. Depression: Psychiatry follow-up is planned, but the patient is not currently experiencing suicidal ideation.
4. Delirium/confusion: Metabolic abnormalities are being corrected for acute delirium superimposed on chronic dementia. The possibility of starting an antidepressant is being discussed with psychiatry for long-term management of depression. Haldol is being continued, and ECGs are being monitored daily to follow the QT interval.

   patient is a CO2 retainer). CXR w/ opacities and leukocytosis on
   admission, also suspicion for infectious process.  No evidence of PE on
   CTA.
   - Overall, I recommend a change in the focus of her care from
   life-prolonging to quality improving. I do not suspect her hypoxia can
   improve significantly and may be close to her basline, but we can try
   to treat her dyspnea symptoms.
   - Continue Lasix gtt if IV access allowed

   on the lasix drip, foley catheter replaced to better monitor I/Os.
   Remains in slightly positive fluid balance overnight albeit not
   monitoring ideally prior to replacing foley.  Patient notes that she
   feels better this am including improvement in her shortness of breath.
   Benfits from haldol.  Less agitated overnight and very pleasant this
   morning, thanking the team for her care.
   Sitting comfortably in bed at ~ 30 degrees.
   Lungs with basilar crackles, poor inspiratory effort
   Abdomen: soft, not distended, normal bowel sounds

   drip. [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes.  Appreciate psychiatry consultants input, willl
   follow recommendations.
   Will touch base with geriatrics service following her at the nursing

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which is likely due to acute-on-chronic heart failure and COPD exacerbation. This could lead to further respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, which is a low level of oxygen in the blood. This can be a result of the respiratory distress and may require supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support.

3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis on admission and opacities on chest X-ray, suggesting an infectious process. This could indicate pneumonia or another type of infection.

4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is showing signs of delirium or confusion, which may be due to multiple factors such as metabolic disturbances, infection, or medication effects. Close monitoring and management by a psychiatrist is recommended.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of intravascular volume depletion suggest acute kidney injury. This could be caused by dehydration or contrast-induced nephropathy.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient had an episode of hypernatremia, which is high sodium levels in the blood. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not corrected.

7. Urethral Trauma: The patient experienced urethral trauma due to repeated removal of the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, hypoxia, and tachypnea. The patient's current condition includes delirium, hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, depression, hypertension, hypoglycemia, acute on chronic heart failure, and possible infectious process. The patient's treatment plan involves continuing Lasix, standing short-acting nebs, empiric coverage of HCAP, weaning O2, strict I/Os, and morphine for dyspnea. Other issues include CHF, delirium on dementia/depression/anxiety, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, urethral trauma, hypoglycemia, hypertension, right breast mass and skin changes, and glycemic control. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged delirium and confusion due to underlying dementia and depression.
2. Worsening respiratory failure leading to further hypoxia and hypercarbia.
3. Complications related to acute renal failure such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and risk factors.
5. Nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia) due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.
6. Urethral trauma and potential urinary"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and breast cancer. She presents with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure. She has multiple medical complications including delirium, CHF, depression, anxiety, ARF, hypernatremia, hypoglycemia, hypertension, and a right breast mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to hypercarbia and hypoxia. This could be acute on chronic heart failure with concomitant COPD exacerbation. The CXR shows opacities and leukocytosis on admission, indicating an infectious process.

2. CHF (Acute on chronic diastolic CHF): The patient has evidence of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. An echo showed right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, along with ascites on abdominal US.

3. Delirium/Dementia/Depression/Anxiety: The patient has significant sundowning and delirium likely due to toxic metabolic, infectious, or chronic dementia. Psychiatric recommendations are needed, and the patient requires daily EKGs for QTc monitoring.

4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient likely developed ARF from intravascular volume depletion from Lasix use. Also, she received contrast for CTA, which can contribute to renal injury.

   with rather advanced wall calcifications but no local contour
   abnormalities. Surgical
   clips in the right upper mediastinum as before. Right-sided moderate
   amount
   of pleural effusion blunting the right pleural sinus remains
   unchanged.
   Linear basal atelectases bilaterally, but no new parenchymal
   abnormalities are

   # Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial, likely [**1-6**]
   CHF, PNA and COPD exacerbation (at baseline patient is a CO2 retainer).
   Is probably intravascularly dry but extravascularly wet and failing IV
   lasix boluses and drip. No evidence of PE on CTA. Ideally would be a
   candidate for milrinone and more aggressive diuresis, however, this
   would not be consistent with patient
s goals of care.
   - No escalation of care per HCP
   - Repeat BNP
   - Will stop lasix boluses given hypotension and ARF
   - Standing short-acting nebs
   - Cont vanc/cefepime for empiric coverage of HCAP for 8 day course
   (start date [**2189-1-23**] until [**2189-1-31**])
   - Wean O2 (on 2L nc at home)
   - Strict I
s, but without foley will have to rely on daily weights
   - Morphine for dyspnea
   - Appreciate geriatrics recommendations
   - Call pt out to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Rehab as aligns with patient and family
   goals of care
   - Will sign out to MACU to not rehospitalize under any circumstance and
   will eventually be transitioned to official CMO pending her course
   # C diff:
   - Treat w/ iv flagyl for a course of two weeks after abx for HAP end
   # Unresponsiveness: Ruled out hypercarbia. Possibly secondary to being
   hard of hearing and a deep sleeper exacerbated by morphine. Consider
   volitional unresponsiveness given mental illness. TSH wnl.
   - Monitor mental status
   .
   # CHF: Acute on chronic diastolic CHF. Echo w/ RHF and pulm HTN, and
   evidence of ascites on abdominal US. Pt is probably intravascularly dry
   but extravascularly wet.
   - holding ace-I given elevated Cr
   - continue statin
   - DC lasix altogether given no effective diuresis with it and worsening
   prenal ARF
   - Strict I
s, daily weights
   .
   # Delirium on dementia/Depression/Anxiety: Improved for time being. Pt
   with significant sundowning.  Delirium likely toxic metabolic,
   infectious over chronic dementia. Does have intermittent SI. CT head
   w/o acute process. Unfortunately, pt can become occasionally
   belligerent, agitated and has not responded to zyprexa 5mg prn x 2, nor
   to haldol 2mg x 2, therefore would prefer using higher doses during
   acute episodes with daily QTC monitoring.
   - Continue antibiotics for pna
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc
   - Continue olanzapine to 2.5mg PO TID per psych recs
   - Holding ativan and avoiding benzos/anticholinergics
   - Continue restraints - Appreciate psych recs
    .
   # ARF: likely from intravascular volume depletion from lasix. Also
   received contrast for CTA
   - Hold lasix
   - Allow her to reequilibrate on her own
   - Would avoid fluids as would surely worsen her hypoxia
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   # Urethral trauma s/p several removals of foley with balloon inflation.
   Has pulled out this foley.
   - No more foley
   .
   # Hypoglycemia/Type II DM with complications
 Improved. Was on lantus
   70units at NH.
   - hold long acting insulin for now, cover with humalog sliding scale
   - can likely restart lantus after acute process
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - cont dilt
   - hold Lisinopril given ARF
   - reduce asa from 325mg to 81mg PO Daily
   .
   # Right Breast Mass and skin changes - concerning for inflammatory
   breast ca vs breast CA relapse. Did have right cyst on [**Last Name (un) **] from [**5-13**]

   .
   # Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Most likely [**1-6**] PNA, with
   concominent CHF and COPD exacerbation (at baseline patient is a CO2
   retainer). Is probably intravascularly dry but extravascularly wet. No
   evidence of PE on CTA.
   - No escalation of care per HCP
   - Repeat BNP
   - Hold on lasix boluses given hypotension and ARF
   - Transition to PO lasix if possible
   - Standing short-acting nebs
   - Cont vanc/cefepime for empiric coverage of HCAP for 8 day course
   (start date [**2189-1-23**] until [**2189-1-31**])
   - Wean O2 (on 2L nc at home)
   - Strict I
s, but without foley will have to rely on daily weights
   - Morphine for dyspnea
   - Appreciate geriatrics recommendations
   - Would prefer to call pt out to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Rehab
   # Unresponsiveness: Ruled out hypercarbia. Possibly secondary to being
   hard of hearing and a deep sleeper. Consider volitional
   unresponsiveness. TSH wnl.
   - Monitor mental status
   .
   # CHF: Acute on chronic diastolic CHF. Echo w/ RHF and pulm HTN, and
   evidence of ascites on abdominal US. Pt is probably intravascularly dry
   but extravascularly wet.
   - holding ace-I given elevated Cr
   - continue statin
   - Transition to PO lasix
   - Strict I
s, daily weights
   .
   # Delirium on dementia/Depression/Anxiety: Improved for time being. Pt
   with significant sundowning.  Delirium likely toxic metabolic,
   infectious over chronic dementia. Does have intermittent SI. CT head
   w/o acute process. Unfortunately, pt can become occasionally
   belligerent, agitated and has not responded to zyprexa 5mg prn x 2, nor
   to haldol 2mg x 2, therefore would prefer using higher doses during
   acute episodes with daily QTC monitoring.
   - Continue antibiotics for pna
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc
   - Change olanzapine to 2.5mg PO TID per psych recs
   - Holding ativan and avoiding benzos/anticholinergics
   - Removed restraints given calmer symptoms
   - Discuss w/ psych re: further management appreciate their input
    .
   # ARF: likely from intravascular volume depletion from lasix. Also
   received contrast for CTA
   - Hold lasix
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   # Urethral trauma s/p several removals of foley with balloon inflation.
   Has pulled out this foley.
   - No more foley
   .
   # Hypoglycemia/Type II DM with complications
 Improved. Was on lantus
   70units at NH.
   - hold long acting insulin for now, cover with humalog sliding scale
   - can likely restart lantus after acute process
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - cont dilt
   - hold Lisinopril given ARF

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer status post lobectomy, and breast cancer status post lumpectomy. The patient presents with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has pneumonia (PNA) with concomitant congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. She is intravascularly dry but extravascularly wet, and there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA).

2. Unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to being hard of hearing and being a deep sleeper. It is also possible that the unresponsiveness is volitional.

3. CHF: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF. An echocardiogram shows right heart failure (RHF) and pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), along with evidence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound. The patient is intravascularly dry but extravascularly wet.

4. Delirium on dementia/Depression/Anxiety: The patient's delirium is likely toxic/metabolic, infectious over chronic dementia. She has intermittent sleeplessness (SI) and her CT head shows no acute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and tachypnea.
- The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), breast cancer, hypertension, depression, and hypoglycemia.
- The patient was found to be cdiff positive and started on flagyl.
- The patient experienced episodes of somnolence and confusion, but responded to stimulation.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, blood pressure ranging from 137/60 mmHg to 137/100 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient's blood glucose levels were elevated.
- Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, potassium levels, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
- The patient's chest X-ray showed marked cardiac enlargement, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and right-sided pleural effusion.
- The patient has multiple lines, including a central venous catheter and arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and hypoxia indicates a potential respiratory complication. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

2. Infection: The positive cdiff test suggests a possible gastrointestinal infection. It is important to monitor for any signs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer surgery, breast cancer surgery, and depression. She presented with altered mental status and new hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical conditions including cancer, hypertension, diabetes with complications, delirium, and congestive heart failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for hypoxia and tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, likely due to pneumonia (PNA), concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, and congestive heart failure (CHF). There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography (CTA).

2. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing episodes of unresponsiveness, which may be related to being hard of hearing and a deep sleeper. However, other potential causes should also be considered, such as metabolic disturbances or infections. Monitoring mental status is recommended.

3. CHF: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF with evidence of right heart failure (RHF) and pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN). There is also evidence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound. The patient is intravascularly dry but extravascularly wet. Management includes holding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status and acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypoxemia due to congestive heart failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure, Clostridium difficile infection, depression, delirium/confusion, and a history of anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 92/42 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics for the C. diff infection and prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential risk for further respiratory compromise. This may be due to her underlying heart failure and the development of pneumonia during hospitalization. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and continued administration of supplemental oxygen should help maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. It is important to optimize her fluid balance, avoid nephrotoxic medications, and closely monitor renal function. Diuretics may need to be used cautiously to manage fluid overload without worsening renal function.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff infection, which can lead"
