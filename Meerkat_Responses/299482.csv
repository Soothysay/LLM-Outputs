   HPI:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  62 yo male with Hep C cirrhosis and HCC who
   presented to OSH today after noting several weeks of worsening abd
   girth and associated diffuse pain, as well as new lower extr edema. The
   pt also experienced two episodes of BRBPR on the day of admission,
   which is what prompted him acutely to seek medication attention. Pt's
   HCT at the OSH was found to be 29 (unclear baseline) and he was noted
   to be hypotensive with an SBP first in the 80s-90s (close to baseline
   per pt) and then lower to the 70s. The pt was started on a dopamine gtt
   to support his BP and was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for further care.
   Transfused 2 units in ED at [**Hospital1 54**], NG lavage negative in ED.
   [**2023-9-15**] his HR increased to the 160s
 Dopamine was decreased with
   improvement of his HR. Cardiac biomarkers increased slightly over night
 Trop-I 0.21, CK 4390 with MB ~40. Transfused 1 unit of pRBCs for Hct
   <30% and SBP decreasing to the 80s systolic. Discussion re goals of
   care occurred last night with a decision to optimize comfort.
   Specifically if his health issues were [**2-19**] his cancer and not
   reversible then he would want to go home and be comfortable. AICD
   turned off. He is DNR/I.
   Pain has been an increasingly significant issue as he
s become more
   uncomfortable and is responding less to Dilaudid.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male with HCV, cirrhosis and HCC presents with probable lower GIB
   and renal failure of unclear duration that is worsening. He presented
   with increased abdominal distension with pain.
   1)GI Bleed: EGD with erosions in the antrum; granularity and mosaic
   appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive
   gastropathy; varices at the fundus. CT abdomen with very large liver
   causing mass effect on intraperitoneal structures and ileus.
   2) HCV / HCC / cirrhosis: Abdominal CT without ascites, just very large
   liver. Getting albumin.  Will treat empirically for SBP.  Will check
   RUQ US with dopplers to evaluate for portal vein thrombosis.  Liver
   service following and appreciate their recs. Would stop octreotide at
   this time.
   3) Hypotension: Suspect [**2-19**] underlying liver disease and raised
   intrabdominal pressures from direct compression of vasculature with
   decreased venous return to RV.  Cardiac enzymes slightly up, but would
   not pursue any intervention. Would stop statin and not cycle further
   cardiac enzymes. Will keep dopamine on for now with a goal of getting
   him home; anticipate d/c
ing it prior to d/c regardless of BP.
   3) Renal Failure: Worsening creatinine, minimal UOP. Unclear if the
   renal failure is true hepatorenal or pre-renal azotemia or ureteral
   compression from massive liver. Symptomatic monitoring, would not
   continue to follow
lytes or creatinine.
   4) Nutrition: Liberate diet.
   5) ID: Would stop antibiotics given no clear source of infection and
   evolving goals of care.
   6) Code Status: Appears to be end stage hepatocellular CA.  Discussion
   with patient yesterday clarified goals for care
 he wants to get home
   to be with his family and dog. He understands that he is end-stage /
   terminal. Will consult Palliative Care to coordinate dispo. Goal is to
   get him home with hospice as soon as possible. Will change dilaudid to
   morphine given that he
s responded to this better in the past.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal distension and associated diffuse pain, as well as new lower extremity edema. He also experienced two episodes of bloody brownish red port wine stain-like patches on the day of admission, which prompted him to seek medical attention. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) at the hospital was found to be 29 (unclear baseline), and he was noted to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s-90s (close to baseline per pt) and then lower to the 70s. The patient was started on dopamine infusion to support his blood pressure and was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for further care. He received 2 units of blood transfusion in the emergency department (ED) at [**Hospital1 54**], and a negative nasogastric (NG) lavage was performed in the ED. On 2023-09-15, his heart rate increased to the 160s, and dopamine was decreased with improvement of his heart rate. Cardiac biomarkers increased slightly overnight, with Troponin-I at 0.21, CK at 4390 with MB ~40. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for a hematoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal distension, pain, and new lower extremity edema. He experienced two episodes of bleeding from the right bronchial passages (BRBPR) on the day of admission, which prompted his acute medical attention. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) was found to be 29%, and he was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s-90s. He was started on dopamine infusion to support his blood pressure and transferred to another hospital for further care. Two units of blood transfusion were given in the emergency department, and a negative nasogastric lavage was performed. The patient's heart rate increased to the 160s, and dopamine was decreased with improvement in heart rate. Cardiac biomarkers showed a slight increase overnight. The patient's health issues were discussed, and it was decided to optimize comfort. The patient's pain has been increasingly significant, and he is responding less to Dilaudid. The patient's goals of care were changed to comfort measures only (CMO), and he is DNR/DNI. The patient's medical team agrees with the assessment and plan, adding the following points: The patient presented with several weeks of worsening abdominal girth and associated diffuse pain, as well as new lower extremity edema.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  62 yo male with Hep C cirrhosis and HCC who
   presented to OSH today after noting several weeks of worsening abd
   girth and associated diffuse pain, as well as new lower extr edema. The
   pt also experienced two episodes of BRBPR on the day of admission,
   which is what prompted him acutely to seek medication attention. Pt's
   HCT at the OSH was found to be 29 (unclear baseline) and he was noted
   to be hypotensive with an SBP first in the 80s-90s (close to baseline
   per pt) and then lower to the 70s. The pt was started on a dopamine gtt
   to support his BP and was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for further care.
   Transfused 2 units in ED at [**Hospital1 54**], NG lavage negative in ED.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male Hep C cirrhosis and HCC presents with probable lower GIB and
   renal failure of unclear duration.  With suspected new ARF unclear
   duration.  Increased abdominal distension with pain.
   1)GI Bleed:  Would evaluate for varices, 2 large bore IV
s, Start PPI,
   Hold plavix.  GI to scope today. GI mentioned Octreotide but will
   discuss as NG lavage was negative.
   2)Hep C cirrosis/HCC-Will check RUQ US with dopplers, will check
   bladder pressure (20).  Unable to perform tap secondary to lack of
   ascites.  Getting albumin.  Will treat empirically for SBP.  Will check
   RUQ US with dopplers to evaluate for portal vein thrombosis.  Liver
   service following and appreciate their recs.
   3)Hypotension-Suspect secondary to underlying liver disease and raised
   intrabdominal pressures.  Will need to evaluate cardiac etiology with
   cardiac enzymes, TTE. Infection also possible source: pna, sbp. Will
   panculture. Change dopamine to neo for tachycardia.
   3)Renal Failure-Urine lytes, Check continued lytes, kayexlate, consider
   insulin and D10.  Renal consult for elevated K and renal failure.
   4)Nutrition: NPO for now pending scope.
   5)Code Status: Appears to be end stage hepatocellular CA.  Will need to
   discuss code status and treatment goals.  Will see if patient has
   family supports.
   6)Access-Will need to place central line.

The patient has allergies to ceftriaxone and receives various medications including dopamine, octreotide, pantoprazole, insulin, dextrose, and hydromorphone. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his blood pressure is on the lower side. He has sinus tachycardia and a mixed venous oxygen saturation between 97-97%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, mildly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Assessment and plan include evaluating for gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma, potential new acute renal failure, hypotension, and renal failure. The patient is also being treated empirically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and will undergo a repeat ultrasound with Doppler to evaluate for portal vein thrombosis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of rising creatinine levels. The patient underwent an EGD procedure, which revealed erosions in the antrum and granularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach, compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy. Varices were also observed at the fundus. A noncontrast abdominal CT showed ileus and an enlarged liver. The patient's heart rate is currently stable, but they were previously tachycardic to 160s on dopa. Dopa was weaned from 7 to 3 mcg/kg/min with improvement in HR. The patient's blood pressure is low at 86/55 mmHg. The patient has a potassium level of 6.4, for which Kayexylate, insulin, glucose, and calcium were given. The patient has allergies to ceftriaxone and has been receiving dopamine, octreotide, pantoprazole, insulin, dextrose, and hydromorphone. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 86/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,573 mL and output of 215 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results are pending"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male Hep C cirrhosis and HCC presents with probable lower GIB and
   renal failure of unclear duration.
   # Abd pain:
   #GI bleeding: Pt's description of bleeding very suggestive of lower GI
   process, however upper GIB also possible. GI team is aware and planning
   possible endoscopy today. Pt NPO for now. Transfuse to keep HCT stable.
   Q6 hour HCT checks for now. IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Consider octreotide gtt.
   #Renal failure: Pt's prior renal baseline unclear; will need to clarify
   today. Suspect that renal failure is responsible for elevated K and
   likely some component of hyponatremia. Hepatorenal syndrome is high on
   differential in setting of hepatic impairment.
   -check urine lytes
   -pt to by hydrated first with blood and subsequently with crystalloid
   PRN
   -may require albumen infusion
   -kayexalate for elevated potassium; trend frequently
   #Hypotension: Pt denies associated sxs. Suspect that baseline BP runs
   low given liver disease. GI bleeding and abd compartment syndrome may
   also be contributing. Ddx also includes sepsis or SBP.
   -transfuse two units pRBCs
   -check bladder pressure
   -continue dopamine for now but aim to wean; if unable, will need
   central line for alternative pressor
   -diagnostic and therapeutic abd tap
   #Metabloic acidosis: Pt with low serum HCO3 on labs. Etiologies could
   include sepsis, lactic acidosis or ARF.
   -check VBG
   -trend
   #Hyponatremia: Likely related to pt's renal disease as well as possible
   relatively hypovolemia. Prior baseline unclear, although would tolerate
   a lower serum Na in this pt. Will consider NS volume repletion and
   trend.
   #COPD: Appears stable. Continue home Spiriva and Advair.
   #HTN: Hold home antihypertensives in setting of acutely low blood
   pressure.
   #CAD: Hold home BB and Plavix in setting of possible acute GIB.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient presents with probable lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and renal failure of unclear duration.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/55 mmHg to 98/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including:
1. Lower GIB: The patient's description of bleeding suggests a lower GI process, but upper GIB is also possible. The GI team is planning an endoscopy today.
2. Renal failure: The patient's prior renal baseline is unclear, but it is suspected that renal failure is responsible for elevated potassium levels and likely some component of hyponatremia. Hepatorenal syndrome is high on the differential in the setting of hepatic impairment.
3. Hypotension: The patient denies associated symptoms, but low baseline blood pressure due to liver disease may contribute to the hypotension. Other potential causes include GI bleeding, abdominal compartment syndrome, sepsis, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has low serum bicarbonate levels on labs, which could be due to sepsis, lactic acidosis, or acute renal failure (ARF).
5. Hyponatremia: This condition is likely related to the patient's renal disease as well as possible relatively hypovolemia. Prior baseline is unclear, although the patient can tolerate a lower serum sodium level. Volume repletion with normal saline and trend monitoring will be considered.

The patient's current medications include dopamine, octreotide, pantoprazole (Protonix), insulin, dextrose 50%, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and other ICU medications. The patient's allergies include a last dose of antibiotics (ceftriaxone) on 09/17/2101 at 04:00 AM.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient also has elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. Other lab values, including electrolytes and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination findings are incomplete due to non-assessment of several vital signs and body systems.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of GIB, progression of renal failure, development of hepatorenal syndrome, worsening of hypotension, and further deterioration of metabolic acidosis and hyponatremia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient presented with symptoms including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), abdominal pain, increasing abdominal distension, and renal failure. The assessment and plan indicate that the patient is being moved towards comfort measures.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has been passing maroon stool throughout the night, which suggests ongoing bleeding. Continued monitoring and possible transfusion may be required.

2. Renal failure: The patient's prior renal baseline was normal, but now there is evidence of renal failure. Prerenal etiology is suspected, so the patient should be hydrated with blood and crystalloid solution as needed. Albumin infusion and treatment for elevated potassium levels may also be necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure runs low in the 90s, and the cause of hypotension could be due to GI bleeding, abdominal compartment syndrome, sepsis, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Dopamine infusion should be continued for now, aiming to wean it off.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has mixed AG/non-AG metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to acute renal failure (ARF). Treating the underlying cause of ARF is essential.

5. Hyponatremia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a terminally ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is irreversible, and they have been informed about the terminal nature of their condition. The patient initially wanted to go home but was advised against it due to the risk of not surviving the ambulance ride. The patient is currently on low-dose dopamine and morphine for comfort, which has improved pain control. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 63/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications and fluids through IV lines. Lab results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, troponin T, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's condition is being managed with ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status.

He presents with symptoms including abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and renal failure. The patient has been moved towards comfort measures. Imaging studies suggest that the primary cause of pain is a significantly enlarged liver filled with cancer, extending throughout the abdomen. There is no significant ascites or bowel obstruction, but there are distended loops of bowel suggesting possible ileus or compression of the bowel by the enlarged liver.

Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to the significantly enlarged liver filled with cancer. The liver is compressing the surrounding structures, leading to discomfort.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has maroon stool throughout the night, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of bleeding is unclear, and no active bleeding was found during an endoscopy. The patient has been transfused with one unit of blood.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's prior renal baseline is normal, but he now exhibits signs of renal failure. This is suspected to be pre-renal in origin. The patient will be hydrated with blood and subsequently with crystalloids as needed. Albumin infusion and treatment for elevated potassium levels may be required.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure runs low in the 90s, and he denies associated symptoms."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He presented with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), abdominal pain, and renal failure. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, leading to increasing abdominal distension. After discussing the goals of care with the patient and his family, it was decided to transition to comfort care measures (CMO). The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate 88 bpm (with a range of 88-129 bpm), blood pressure 63/45 mmHg (with a range of 63-41/49-87 mmHg), respiratory rate 10 breaths per minute (with a range of 4-16 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's history of cirrhosis and HCC increases his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. The presence of abdominal pain and distension suggests ongoing bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed promptly.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's liver disease, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status, confusion, and somnolence. The patient's current somnolent"
