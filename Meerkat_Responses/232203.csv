 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   63 year old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia,
   hypoglycemia, without obvious source of infection, in guarded
   condition.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC: Although septic shock is most likely etiology, other
   considerations include myxedema coma, adrenal insufficiency, profound
   hypovolemia or hemodynamic process. In light of prior presentations
   with unexplained hypotension, will maintain broad differential.
   Initial Infectious workup remarkable for a positive UA and history of
   entero-uterine fistula. Chest x-ray unremarkable, no meningeal symptoms
   although mental status is altered. Other possible sources include
   surgical site at Right BKA and left foot ulcers. Would also consider
   expansin of fistula from uterus to
   -- Broad spectrum antibiotics; Vancomycin given multiple recent
   hospitalizations and Zosyn given concern for gram negatives, anaerobes
   and pseudomonas in this diabetic.
   -- Volume resusitate, CVP to 16 per early goal directed therapy
   -- No need for transusion at this time
   -- F/U Blood, urine cultures
   -- Consider dedicated fungal cultures
   -- Add baseline cortisol, would consider dexamethasone if refractory
   hypotension
 HYPOTHERMIA: Unclear etiology in this female with history of CVA, now
   with recurrent presentations of very low core temperature. Would favor
   a central process with temperature disregulation, however important
   etiologies to evaluate for include sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and
   myxedema coma. Patient however has been evaluated in prior admission
   and only has a low normal TSH and normal cortisol.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: Unclear etiology from prior admissions,
   suspect bone marrow supression vs consumptive process.
   -- Avoid H2 blockers, meds that could cause thrombocytopenia
   -- Recent HIT antibody negative, would not re check
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): : Baseline
   Creatinine 1.1 to 1.3, now 2.3. Given hypotension, suspect this most
   likely represents pre-renal azotemia, however differential diagnosis
   includes post renal and intrinsic process
   -- Urine culture
   -- Urine lytes
   -- Empiric fluids
   -- Renal ultrasound
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Although baseline is very
   limited, per daughter patient less interactive than at baseline.
   Suspect this is likely to systemic process
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Very low bicarbonate on admission, lactate
   however was normal. No anion gap. Most likely this represents GI losses
   vs decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal function.
   -- Fluid resusitation
   -- Would use LR / D5
 NS with Bicarb as IV fluid
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS: Continue Keppra 500mg daily

","Summary:
- The patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition.
- The patient has a history of recent hospitalizations, diabetes, and an entero-uterine fistula.
- She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to positive urine analysis and history of the fistula.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Physical examination shows cool extremities, stage II ulcer on the left buttock, and a well-healed right below-knee amputation.
- Lab results indicate thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 47 K/uL), acute renal failure (creatinine level of 2.3), altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, and a history of seizure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia could be indicative of septic shock. The positive urine analysis and history of entero-uterine fistula suggest a possible infectious etiology.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to bone marrow suppression"

   -- Intracranial pathology less likely as hypothermia resolved with
   rewarming
   -- Sepsis work up as above
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE, Anemia:  Unclear etiology from prior

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition. The patient has a history of entero-uterine fistula, diabetes, and previous hospitalizations.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Shock, septic: Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) have been initiated due to a positive urinalysis and history of entero-uterine fistula. The concern is for gram-negative, anaerobic, and pseudomonas infections in this diabetic patient. IV fluids with a goal of maintaining a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 have been administered. Two units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) have been transfused overnight. Blood and urine cultures have been sent for follow-up.

2. Hypothermia: The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and intracranial pathology. Intracranial pathology is less likely as hypothermia resolved with rewarming. Sepsis workup is ongoing.

3. Thrombocytopenia, acute: Anemia is unclear etiology from prior admissions, suspecting bone marrow suppression vs a consumptive process. No recent heparin or drugs on board likely to cause new thrombocytopenia, no new drugs."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   63 year old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia,
   hypoglycemia, without obvious source of infection, in guarded
   condition.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC: Initial Infectious workup remarkable for a positive UA
   and history of entero-uterine fistula. Chest x-ray unremarkable, no
   meningeal symptoms although mental status is altered. Other possible
   sources include surgical site at Right BKA and left foot ulcers.
   -- Broad spectrum antibiotics; Vancomycin given multiple recent
   hospitalizations and Zosyn given concern for gram negatives, anaerobes
   and pseudomonas in this diabetic.
   -- Volume resusitate, CVP goal of 8
   -- Transfused two u pRBCs overnight
   -- F/U Blood, urine cultures
   -- [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test with appropriate rise in cortisol so adrenal
   insufficiency less likely
 HYPOTHERMIA: Ddx includes sepsis, hypotension, hypoglycemia and
   intracranial pathology.
   -- Intracranial pathology less likely as hypothermia resolved with
   rewarming
   -- Sepsis work up as above
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: Unclear etiology from prior admissions,
   suspect bone marrow supression vs consumptive process.
   -- No recent heparin
   --
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): : Baseline
   Creatinine 1.1 to 1.3, now 2.3. Given hypotension, suspect this most
   likely represents pre-renal azotemia, however differential diagnosis
   includes post renal and intrinsic process
   -- Urine culture
   -- Urine lytes
   -- Empiric fluids
   -- Renal ultrasound
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Although baseline is very
   limited, per daughter patient less interactive than at baseline.
   Suspect this is likely to systemic process
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Very low bicarbonate on admission, lactate
   however was normal. No anion gap. Most likely this represents GI losses
   vs decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal function.
   -- Fluid resusitation
   -- Would use LR / D5
 NS with Bicarb as IV fluid
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS: Continue Keppra 500mg daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition. The patient has a history of entero-uterine fistula, diabetes, and multiple recent hospitalizations.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 72 bpm (normal range 56-84 bpm), blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg (normal range 62-140/60-78 mmHg), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (normal range 12-22 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 47 K/uL, acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.3 (baseline 1.1-1.3), altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia with a glucose level of 123 mg/dL.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, hypothermia, and altered mental status could be indicative of septic shock. The positive urine analysis and history of an entero-uterine fistula suggest a possible urinary tract infection as a potential source of infection.

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition and has a history of entero-uterine fistula. Her initial infectious workup was remarkable for a positive urine analysis. She is now no longer hypothermic or hypoglycemic, and her mental status is improving. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Shock, septic: The patient initially presented with signs of septic shock, which is a severe response to infection. However, her condition has improved, and she is now stable.

2. Thrombocytopenia, acute: The patient has low platelet counts, which can be due to various causes such as bone marrow suppression or a consumptive process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

3. Renal failure, acute: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have increased from 1.1 to 1.3 to 1.9, indicating acute renal failure. This could be pre-renal azotemia, post-renal, or intrinsic renal pathology. Renal US was negative.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, although it is improving. This could be due to a systemic process, and neurologic recommendations are being followed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure ranging from 136/62 mmHg to 163/80 mmHg, heart rate between 79 and 94 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her cardiovascular examination reveals normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and bilateral radial and dorsalis pedis pulses present. The respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally. The abdominal examination is unremarkable.

The patient has muscle wasting and is unable to stand. Neurological examination reveals spontaneous movement in the lower extremities, possibly clonus, and a stage II ulcer on the left buttock. Foley catheterization shows dark milky urine.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.9-17.5 thousand/mm3, thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from 47-55 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels from 1.9-2.3 mg/dL, and metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate level of 18 mEq/L.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, enterovaginal fistulas, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and seizure disorder. She was admitted to the ICU with hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia. The patient received heat, vancomycin (Vanc), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and fluids, with brief need for pressors. She experienced a seizure and is currently on levetiracetam (Keppra). The patient also has thrombocytopenia, for which a hematology consult was requested, and acute renal failure, suspected to be pre-renal due to recent hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/53-163/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is 77%. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be unresponsive, with warm and non-tender skin, no cyanosis or clubbing, and right below-knee amputation (BKA). Neurological examination shows the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but has not been assessed for movement or tone. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count"

   for a positive UA and history of entero-uterine fistula. Chest x-ray
   showed left lower lobe opacity concerning for pna. Other possible
   sources include Right BKA and left foot ulcers. Pt now no longer
   hypothermic/ hypoglycemic.  Intracranial pathology less likely as

 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE, Anemia:  Unclear etiology from prior
   admissions, suspect bone marrow supression vs consumptive process..
   Bactrim stopped already. No recent heparin, no other drugs on board
   likely to cause new thrombocytopenia, no new drugs.

   malabsorption and e/o pernicious anemia on EGD
   -- stopped IV ppi (as may be contributing)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): : Baseline
   Creatinine 1.1 to 1.3, now 1.9 (down from 2.3 on admission). Given
   hypotension, suspect this most likely represents ATN. Renal US neg.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia, without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition and has a history of entero-uterine fistula, which could be a potential source of infection. The patient's mental status is improving, and her hypothermia and hypoglycemia have resolved. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 161/72 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 80 bpm. Her respiratory rate is normal at 12 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 47 K/uL, acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL, and metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate level of 19 mEq/L. 

The assessment and plan include treating the patient for shock and sepsis, given her positive urine analysis and history of entero-uterine fistula. There are also concerns about acute thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, and a history of seizures. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, development of septic shock, progression of thrombocytopenia, and further deterioration of mental status."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and altered mental status. She has a history of chronic pancreatitis, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), chronic hypothermia, and seizure disorder. The patient is currently in the ICU for septic shock, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic acidosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, hypothermia, and altered mental status suggest septic shock. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. If left untreated, acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure and require dialysis or kidney transplantation.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of thrombocytopenia. This condition needs to be managed carefully to prevent hemorrhagic complications.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate levels indicate metabolic acidosis. If not corrected, this condition can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory depression, and tissue damage.

5. Malnutrition: The patient's history of chronic pancreatitis and altered mental status may contribute to"
