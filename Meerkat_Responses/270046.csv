","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the ED without effect. There is a concern for acute psychosis versus alcohol withdrawal. A psych consult advised that symptoms are consistent with EtOH withdrawal and not acute psychosis. The patient has improved with valium, indicating likely EtOH withdrawal. No fevers or leukocytosis were noted. The patient reports her last drink of alcohol was this past Friday. 

The patient has altered mental status, agitation, and no acute psychosis. She has tachycardia, bronchial breath sounds, and mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ). 

Laboratory results show mild hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin of 3, but no evidence of hemolysis. The patient also has pancytopenia, which is likely due to chronic alcohol use. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is likely experiencing EtOH withdrawal, as she has improved with valium. No fevers or leukocytosis were observed, and a chest X-ray and urinalysis were negative. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been sent. Valium 15-30 mg IV will be given for CIWA scores greater than 10.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, likely due to chronic alcohol use. No prior values"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the ED without effect and was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 38.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 153/87 mmHg to 209/166 mmHg, heart rate between 97 and 123 bpm, respiratory rate between 18 and 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for concern of EtOH withdrawal. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.

The physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments were not performed. 

Laboratory tests including blood culture and sensitivity, sputum culture, liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis (U/A), chest X-ray (CXR), and blood alcohol level were ordered. The patient's serum and urine toxicology screen came back positive for benzodiazepines, which she receives regularly.

Assessment and plan:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is likely experiencing EtOH withdrawal, as she has improved with valium administration. No fevers or leukocytosis are noted, and it is unclear if an underlying infection is playing a role."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the ED without effect and has shown improvement with additional valium. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to EtOH withdrawal, as there are no signs of underlying infection (normal CXR and negative U/A). The patient's last drink of alcohol was this past Friday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink. Symptoms include severe agitation, confusion, fever, rapid heartbeat, and tremors.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures, which may occur within 6-48 hours after the last drink.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may be exacerbated during alcohol withdrawal or due to other factors.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has been diagnosed with pancytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets. Chronic alcohol use can lead to bone marrow suppression and pancytopenia.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's RUQ ultrasound is pending, indicating a possible gallbladder or liver issue, which could be related to chronic alcohol use.

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal.  Psych
   consult advised that symptoms c/w EtOh withdrawal and not acute
   psychosis
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by Etoh withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially were
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Pt is currently 8 days away from
   last Etoh use and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.  Will
   follow with psych today as to other recommendations for management
   seeing that the Benzo therapy and Haldol has not been as effective.
   Psych currently is getting in touch with the MH centre in [**Location (un) 1792**] to
   see if pt has any psych diagnoses or medication regimens.
   -Will continue Valium 15-30mg iv for CIWA>10, IV Haldol pending further

   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch yesterday. Pt has been
   hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be withdrawal may
   actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN after her
   Clonidine patch was d/c

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. She was initially treated with valium in the emergency department, but it did not have an effect. The consulting psychiatrists advised that the symptoms were consistent with EtOH withdrawal, not acute psychosis. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, hallucinations, and extreme agitation, and has received a total of XXX Diazepam and XXX Haldol. She reports her last drink of alcohol was this past Friday.

Potential medical complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: The patient is showing signs of severe alcohol withdrawal, including altered mental status, agitation, and hallucinations. If left untreated, this can lead to more serious complications such as seizures and delirium tremens.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of chronic alcohol use and presents with pancytopenia, which includes low white blood cell count, low red blood cell count, and low platelet count. Chronic alcohol use can cause bone marrow suppression and lead to pancytopenia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels without evidence of hemolysis. This could be due to liver dysfunction or other underlying causes. Monitoring liver function and investigating potential causes is important.

4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of"

   Chief Complaint: EtOh withdrawal/delirium
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient remained very agitated during the day.  She had received
   ~ 620 mg of valium total yesterday and this am, so psych recommended
   using haldol instead of valium as she was likely valium intoxicated.
   She got 10 mg of po haldol x 2, then 30 mg IV valium x 1, then 5 mg of
   zyprexa x 1 and continued to have agitation.  She then received another
   10 mg IV valium.  Psych was recontacted and recommended giving 5 mg IV
   haldol q1h prn.  She became so agitated that security had to be called
   non-urgently to place leather restraints as she was almost climbing out
   of bed with the cloth restraints in place.  She continued to receive
   haldol q1h, but her agitation grew and psych had to come and reevalute
   her.  They felt her agitation was consistent with delirium and
   continued to recommend avoid benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn.
   As her QTc was becoming getting longer (up to 466) they stated if it
   became > 500, she could be loaded with depakote orally.  Also wanted to
   check an EKG after each haldol dose.
   - TSH, Vit B12, folate, haptoglobin, and thiamine was ordered.  TSH,
   Vit B12, and folate were WNL.  haptoglobin < 20.

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal.  Psych
   consult advised that symptoms c/w EtOh withdrawal and not acute
   psychosis.
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Thes yesterday when patient
   continued to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she
   was benzo intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt
   is currently 9 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. .Psych
   currently is getting in touch with the MH centre in [**Location (un) 1792**] to see if
   pt has any psych diagnoses or medication regimens.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the ED without effect, and there is concern for acute psychosis versus alcohol withdrawal. Psych consult advised symptoms consistent with EtOH withdrawal and not acute psychosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancytopenia - The patient has low platelet count, hemoglobin, and white blood cell count. This can be attributed to chronic alcohol use and is expected to improve over time.
2. Hyperbilirubinemia - The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which could be due to various causes including liver dysfunction or hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Hypertension - The patient has a history of high blood pressure, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal or rebound hypertension after discontinuing the clonidine patch.
4. Delirium - The patient is experiencing agitation and altered mental status, which can be a result of alcohol withdrawal or psychosis. It is important to manage her symptoms with appropriate medications and monitor her response closely.
5. Thiamine deficiency - Chronic alcohol use can lead to thiamine deficiency, which can cause neurological complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy. Thiamine levels should be monitored, and supplementation should be provided if necessary.
6. Potential infections - The patient's low haptoglobin level suggests the possibility of an ongoing hemolytic"

   Chief Complaint: EtOh withdrawal/delirium
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient remained very agitated during the day.  She had received
   ~ 620 mg of valium total yesterday and this am, so psych recommended
   using haldol instead of valium as she was likely valium intoxicated.
   She got 10 mg of po haldol x 2, then 30 mg IV valium x 1, then 5 mg of
   zyprexa x 1 and continued to have agitation.  She then received another
   10 mg IV valium.  Psych was recontacted and recommended giving 5 mg IV
   haldol q1h prn.  She became so agitated that security had to be called
   non-urgently to place leather restraints as she was almost climbing out
   of bed with the cloth restraints in place.  She continued to receive
   haldol q1h, but her agitation grew and psych had to come and reevalute
   her.  They felt her agitation was consistent with delirium and
   continued to recommend avoid benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn.
   As her QTc was becoming getting longer (up to 466) they stated if it
   became > 500, she could be loaded with depakote orally.  Also wanted to
   check an EKG after each haldol dose.
   - TSH, Vit B12, folate, haptoglobin, and thiamine was ordered.  TSH,
   Vit B12, and folate were WNL.  haptoglobin < 20.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for suspected EtOH withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the ED without effect and has been diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient's altered mental status is unclear in origin, but components suggest EtOH withdrawal. Psych initially suspected benzodiazepine intoxication and recommended IV Haldol, but later reevaluated and decided that symptoms were due to EtOH withdrawal. The patient is 8 days away from her last EtOH use and has not displayed classic withdrawal symptoms such as diaphoresis or tremors. Her CIWA scale is elevated only due to agitation. Psych is currently in touch with the MH center to check for any psych diagnoses or medication regimens.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's agitation and altered mental status could progress to delirium, which is a potential medical complication in patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal.
2. Seizures: EtOH withdrawal can lead to seizures, which can be a life-threatening complication. The patient's history of alcohol use and current symptoms put her at risk for seizures.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low platelet count, hematocrit, and white blood cell count indicate pancytopenia. This condition can be associated with chronic alcohol use and may worsen if left untreated.

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without

   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Thes yesterday when patient
   continued to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she
   was benzo intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt
   is currently 9 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. .Psych
   currently is getting in touch with the MH centre in [**Location (un) 1792**] to see if

   Chief Complaint: EtOh withdrawal/delirium
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient remained very agitated during the day.  She had received
   ~ 620 mg of valium total yesterday and this am, so psych recommended
   using haldol instead of valium as she was likely valium intoxicated.
   She got 10 mg of po haldol x 2, then 30 mg IV valium x 1, then 5 mg of
   zyprexa x 1 and continued to have agitation.  She then received another
   10 mg IV valium.  Psych was recontacted and recommended giving 5 mg IV
   haldol q1h prn.  She became so agitated that security had to be called
   non-urgently to place leather restraints as she was almost climbing out
   of bed with the cloth restraints in place.  She continued to receive
   haldol q1h, but her agitation grew and psych had to come and reevalute
   her.  They felt her agitation was consistent with delirium and
   continued to recommend avoid benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn.
   As her QTc was becoming getting longer (up to 466) they stated if it
   became > 500, she could be loaded with depakote orally.  Also wanted to
   check an EKG after each haldol dose.
   - TSH, Vit B12, folate, haptoglobin, and thiamine was ordered.  TSH,
   Vit B12, and folate were WNL.  haptoglobin < 20.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She continues to need high doses of IV haldol for control of agitation.
   She is finally asleep as a consequence with Qtc close to .47ms. She has
   been able to request and take liquids and food without distress.
   Exam notable for Tm  99.5 BP of 138/77  HR of 86 RR  of 12 with sats of
   95% on RA .
   Labs notable for WBC 6.3K, HCTof 31.8 , plts of 118K ,Cr  of 0.6, and
   Na of 139  EKG with QTc of 0.47 .
   Agree with plan to continue with haldol ( PO standing and IV prn) and
   benzodiazepines for agitation if needed given prolonging QTc.
   Psychiatry colleagues to advise regarding other antipsychotic agents as
   this is less likely to be ETOH withdrawal given exam and temporal
   profile of symptoms.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is hemodynamically stable but in need of close monitoring and
   nursing help with sitter in room

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for EtOH withdrawal. She has a history of unreliable information, but it is mentioned that she is 9 days away from her last EtOH use. The patient's chief complaint is EtOH withdrawal/delirium. She received a total of 620 mg of valium yesterday and this morning, but still remained very agitated. Psych recommended using haldol instead of valium due to possible valium intoxication. The patient received 10 mg of oral haldol twice, then 30 mg IV valium once, followed by 5 mg of zyprexa once. Despite these interventions, the patient continued to have agitation and was eventually restrained. Her QTc interval was increasing, reaching up to 466. Psych recommended avoiding benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn. They also suggested checking an EKG after each haldol dose. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 105/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Then two days when patient continued
   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will continue standing haldol 5mg q4h po given intemittently
   escalating agitation with only prn dosing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180 mg of Valium in the emergency department without effect. The patient has been diagnosed with acute psychosis versus alcohol withdrawal, and her symptoms have been improving.

The patient's altered mental status is unclear in terms of etiology, with components potentially explained by EtOH withdrawal and psychosis. The initial recommendation from psychiatry was IV Haldol due to suspected benzodiazepine intoxication, but since there was no response, psychiatry reevaluated and felt that the patient was benzodiazepine-intoxicated. They recommended Haldol q1h prn for agitation.

The patient is currently 10 days away from her last EtOH use, and she has not displayed symptoms such as diaphoresis or tremors. Her CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. Psychiatry is following up on the patient's case and appreciates the recommendations.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, the patient is at risk for:
1. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient was given a significant amount of Valium, and there is a concern about benzodiazepine withdrawal. Symptoms may include agitation, tremors, seizures, and hallucinations.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: Although the patient is 10 days away from her last EtOH use, she still shows signs of agitation, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Then two days when patient continued
   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will continue standing haldol now at 5mg tid
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium and monitor for benzo withdrawal.
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc, monitor and replete K and Mg.
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 169, hct 32.8 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   thiamine pending
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 yesterday, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.  Likely from breakdown of her recent bruises.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c
d.   As her agitation has improved,
   her BP
s have stabilized.
   - continue clonidine patch

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 3474**] has required less Haldol over the past 24 hours and only 10
   mg Valium overnight. She is now oriented to place and time too and does
   admit to a long term pattern of alcohol abuse. Last period of
   abstinence was greater than 2 years ago. She does feel anxious
   Exam notable for Tm of 99.1 BP of 121/66 HR of 74 RR of 10 with sats of
   95% on RA. She has good air movement in all lung fields. She is not
   tremulous. There is no peripheral edema. Labs notable for WBC 10.9 K,
   HCT of 32.8 , K+  of 4.0, Cr of 0.6. EKG shows QTc fo 0.472 ms
   Agree with plan to transition to standing PO haldol and prn Valium. She
   will need transfer to Psych facility if psychiatrists decide that is
   best for her safety and assessment. She is medically cleared at this
   time
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for EtOH withdrawal.
- She received 180 mg of valium in the ED without effect.
- There was concern for acute psychosis versus alcohol withdrawal, but now improving.
- The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertension.
- She has been treated with haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation and continues to be monitored for benzodiazepine (benzo) withdrawal.
- The patient's condition has stabilized, and she is expected to be transitioned to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Benzo Withdrawal: The patient was initially given a significant amount of IV valium, which may accumulate in adipose tissue and slowly decrease over time. However, there is a concern for benzodiazepine withdrawal due to the lack of response to valium. Monitoring for symptoms of withdrawal, such as agitation, tremors, and seizures, is essential.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of long-term alcohol abuse and is currently 10 days away from her last ethanol use. Although her CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state, there is still a risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted from an inpatient psychiatric unit for concern of ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the emergency department without effect. There was concern for acute psychosis versus alcohol withdrawal, but now the patient is improving. The patient's mental status is altered, and the etiology is unclear. She has components that would be explained by EtOH withdrawal but also for psychosis. The psychiatric unit initially recommended intravenous haloperidol, but given the lack of response, they were consulted again, and it was decided that the symptoms were due to EtOH withdrawal. The patient is currently 9 days away from her last EtOH use and has not displayed any signs of diaphoresis or tremors. Her Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. The psychiatric unit is in touch with the mental health center to see if the patient has any psychiatric diagnoses or medication regimens.

The patient has been started on oral haloperidol 5 mg per day and will be titrated up as needed for agitation. Valium is being held, and the patient will continue to have her QTc interval monitored on a daily basis.

The patient also presents with pancytopenia, with a platelet count of 119,000 and hematocrit of 31%, which is improving. This may be related to chronic alcohol use."

   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Thes yesterday when patient
   continued to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she
   was benzo intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt
   is currently 9 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. .Psych
   currently is getting in touch with the MH centre in [**Location (un) 1792**] to see if
   pt has any psych diagnoses or medication regimens.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female who was admitted from an inpatient psychiatric unit for suspected ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. She received 180 mg of Valium in the emergency department without effect and has been experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to either acute psychosis or alcohol withdrawal. 

The patient's current vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is currently on a regular diet and has improved mentation.

The patient has a history of chronic alcohol use and is 9 days away from her last EtOH use. She has not displayed typical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as diaphoresis or tremors, and her CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. Psychiatric consultation recommended the use of haloperidol (Haldol) to manage her agitation, as benzodiazepine intoxication was initially suspected. 

The patient's blood tests show pancytopenia with a platelet count of 119,000/mm3, hemoglobin concentration of 31%, and white blood cell count of 6.3 thousand/mm3. These values are improving over time. Other lab results indicate mild hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin level of 2 mg/dL."

She received 180 mg of valium in the emergency department without effect. The patient's altered mental status is unclear, but there are components that could be explained by alcohol withdrawal or psychosis. The psychiatry team initially recommended IV haldol due to suspected benzodiazepine intoxication but later decided that the symptoms were related to alcohol withdrawal. The patient has not been diaphoretic, displayed tremors, and her CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.

The psychiatry team is currently getting in touch with the mental health center to see if the patient has any psychiatric diagnoses or medication regimens. The plan is to start standing haldol 5mg po given intermittently escalating agitation with only prn dosing, continue haldol prn q1h per psychiatry recommendations, hold valium, and monitor QTc with a daily EKG.

The patient also has pancytopenia with a platelet count of 119 and hemoglobin concentration of 31%. This morning's labs show an improvement.

   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Then two days when patient continued
   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will start standing haldol 5mg q4h po given intemittently escalating
   agitation with only prn dosing
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc

   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU from an inpatient psychiatric unit for suspected ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the emergency department without effect. The initial concern was acute psychosis versus alcohol withdrawal, but now the patient is improving. She has been diagnosed with altered mental status, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertension.

The patient has been started on haloperidol (Haldol) 5 mg orally every 4 hours as needed for agitation and will continue with this treatment. Valium will be held and monitored for potential benzodiazepine withdrawal. An EKG will be done daily to monitor QTc, and the patient will be followed up with RPR and thiamine tests. Pancytopenia is improving, and further investigation into chronic alcohol use is planned. Hyperbilirubinemia is being trended, and the cause is unclear. The patient's hypertension is thought to be related to her agitation and rebound hypertension after discontinuation of clonidine patch. The clonidine patch will be continued.

ICU care includes regular diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and she can be called out to the floor today.
