   Assessment and Plan
   THIS IS THE PLAN FROM YESTERDAY; PRELIMINARY NOTE FOR ROUNDS USE
   ONLY!!!!
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging now intubated.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. A component of volume
   overload cannot be excluded given her I/O positive >7 liters over the
   past several days. A primary lung reaction to her chemo is much less
   likely. Other possibilities including a primary cardiac event or PE are
   less likely with a relatively unchanged EKG and no tachycardia.  Given
   rapid improvement of CXR after intubation, suspect that right lung
   white out was due to mucus plugging. ABG post intubation showed
   signficant acidosis with pH of 7.27.
   - increase RR & recheck ABG
   - advance ETT & recheck placement
   - no need for Abx currently
   - f/u sputum Cx & low threshold to start ABx if spikes temp
   - wean sedation, SBT & RSBI in am
   - continue regular suction & albuterol MDI
   - diuresis goal neg 1-2L
   - consider thoracentesis for diagnosis & therapeutic
   - recheck EKG (given pseudonormalization on tracing from am)
   - cycle CE to ROMI
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on [**2144-10-9**].
   This acute hypoxia more likely due to aspiration & mucus plug, unlikely
   due to chemo toxicity.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - f/u Onc recs
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   .
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].
   - will keep NPO for now (possible extubation in am)
   - continue po vanco & IV flagyl
   - place rectal tube now
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   - f/u C diff toxin
   - repeat imaging in am
   .
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). Rates have been better controlled on
   current regimen of Metoprolol, Amiodarone & Diltiazem.  No plan for
   anticoagulation due to bloody pericardial effusion.  Currently in NSR
   with rate in 60s.
   - continue Metoprolol & diltiazem & amiodarone
   - f/u repeat EKG
   .
   # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**10-11**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1
   - change out foley now
   - resend UA & Urine Cx
   - hold off on Fluconazole for now
   .
   # F/E/N: IVF prn, NPO for now, OG tube to intermittent suction
   - replete lytes agressively
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. Other possibilities, such as primary cardiac event or pulmonary embolism, are less likely. The patient's rapid improvement of chest X-ray after intubation suggests that the right lung whiteout was due to mucus plugging.

Plan:
- Increase respiratory rate and recheck arterial blood gas (ABG)
- Advance endotracheal tube (ETT) and recheck placement
- No need for antibiotics currently
- Follow up sputum culture and low threshold to start antibiotics if fever spikes
- Wean sedation, spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and respiratory system assessment (RSBI) in the morning
- Continue regular suctioning and albuterol metered-dose inhaler (MDI)
- Diuresis goal negative 1-2 liters
- Consider thoracentesis for diagnosis and therapeutic purposes
- Recheck EKG (given pseudonormalization on tracing from the morning)

2. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient has completed the EAC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. He has been started on invasive ventilation and an arterial line. The patient's EKG showed abnormalities compared to previous ones, so cycling enzymes have been initiated. The patient is NPO due to aspiration risk and possible extubation today. His last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole at 12:52 AM on 10/14/2144. The patient is receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions, as well as Lasix, heparin sodium, and other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/49-172/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O. His ABG results show a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 225, and Ve of 8 L/min. The patient's blood cultures were collected at 2:05 PM on 10/13/2144 and repeated at 2:52 PM, 5:30 PM, 4:22 AM, and 4:50 AM on 10/14/2144. His lab results show a WBC count of 10.6 K/uL, Hct of 25.3%, Plt of 393 K/uL, Cr of 0.5 mg/dL, Troponin-T of <0.01, and other lab values within normal range. The patient has a history of drug allergies to metronidazole. The patient's code status is DNR, and disposition is pending further evaluation. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and glycemic control issues due to the use of IV fluids and medications."

   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging now intubated.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Patient with less O2
   requirements and improved chest film. [**Month (only) 60**] be able to be extubated later
   today. Will decrease sedation and to a breathing test.
   - f/u sputum Cx & low threshold to start ABx if spikes temp
   - wean sedation, SBT & RSBI
   - continue regular suction & albuterol MDI
   - diuresis goal neg 1-2L
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on [**2144-10-9**].
    WBC trending down after chemotherapy.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - f/u Onc recs
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   -f/u WBC and HCT
   # Anemia: Normocytic, normochromic anemia with very high ferritin and
   high TIBC. Most likely due to chronic disease and HCT trending down
   after chemotherapy. HCT 21 today.
   -          Transfuse 2 RBC packs today; goal HCT >21
   -          Follow HCT after transfusion
   .
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  Patient still
   having diarrhea, but no other symptoms. C diff toxin in stool is not
   useful at this point due to recent prior infection. [**Month (only) 60**] need workup for
   chronic diarrhea, but not likely since patient with tube feeds.
   - will keep NPO for now (possible extubation in am)
   - continue po vanco & IV flagyl
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   .
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). Rates have been better controlled on
   current regimen of Metoprolol, Amiodarone & Diltiazem.  No plan for
   anticoagulation due to bloody pericardial effusion.  Currently in NSR
   with rate in 60s.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. The patient presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, which resulted in intubation.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, anemia, h/o megacolon/diarrhea, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection (UTI), and code status of DNR (do not resuscitate).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of the endotracheal tube.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: Intensive care unit (ICU) stay and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line and arterial line, which can potentially lead to bloodstream infections.
5. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Overdistension or repetitive opening and closing of al"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration/plugging. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Overnight, the patient's oxygenation improved, and the lung re-inflated on chest radiograph.

The patient has several medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, Hodgkin's lymphoma, anemia, megacolon (chronic)/C. difficile, pericardial effusion, and femoral endovascular procedure (FEN). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 114/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood glucose level is within normal range, but other lab values such as troponin T, creatinine, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes discontinuing sedation, performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and considering extubation if successful. The patient also requires monitoring for anemia, megacolon, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient will be kept in the ICU for further care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma from mechanical ventilation, ventilator-induced lung injury, aspiration pneumonia, and infection due to the presence of an arterial line or other invasive lines. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, infection parameters, and adherence to infection control measures will be crucial in preventing these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to mucous
   plugging/aspiration.  Improved overnight.  Poor RSBI because of
   hypo-ventilation which may be secondary to sedation.
   Plan: Discontinue sedation, PS, and repeat SBT in several hours after
   sedation is worn off
   2) Hodgkins lymphoma:
   - s/p chemo; on prophylaxis
   3) Anemia:  Monitor hematocrit and perform PRBC transfusion
   4) Megacolon (chronic)/c. dificile: Vanc PO and Flagyl IV.
   5) Pericardial

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration/plugging. The patient's condition improved overnight, with oxygenation improving and lung re-inflation on chest radiograph.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 114/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has several medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, Hodgkin's lymphoma, anemia, megacolon (chronic)/C. difficile, and pericardial effusion. The patient is also receiving various medications, such as fentanyl, midazolam, furosemide, heparin sodium, and others.

The patient's laboratory results show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, troponin T, blood glucose, and electrolytes. However, the patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 10.6 K/uL.

The patient's plan includes discontinuing sedation, performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and considering extubation if the patient shows improvement. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and her disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include"

   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging now intubated.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Patient with less O2
   requirements and improved chest film. [**Month (only) 60**] be able to be extubated later
   today. Will decrease sedation and to a breathing test.
   - f/u sputum Cx & low threshold to start ABx if spikes temp
   - wean sedation, SBT & RSBI
   - continue regular suction & albuterol MDI
   - diuresis goal neg 1-2L
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - f/u Onc recs
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   -f/u WBC and HCT
   # Anemia: Normocytic, normochromic anemia with very high ferritin and
   high TIBC. Most likely due to chronic disease and HCT trending down
   after chemotherapy. HCT 21 today.
   -          Transfuse 2 RBC packs today; goal HCT >21
   -          Follow HCT after transfusion
   .
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  Patient still
   having diarrhea, but no other symptoms. C diff toxin in stool is not
   useful at this point due to recent prior infection. [**Month (only) 60**] need workup for
   chronic diarrhea, but not likely since patient with tube feeds.
   - will keep NPO for now (possible extubation in am)
   - continue po vanco & IV flagyl
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   .
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). Rates have been better controlled on
   current regimen of Metoprolol, Amiodarone & Diltiazem.  No plan for
   anticoagulation due to bloody pericardial effusion.  Currently in NSR
   with rate in 60s.
   - continue Metoprolol & diltiazem & amiodarone
   - f/u repeat EKG
   .
   # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**10-11**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1
   - change out foley now
   - resend UA & Urine Cx
   - hold off on Fluconazole for now
   .
   # F/E/N: IVF prn, NPO for now, OG tube to intermittent suction
   - replete lytes agressively

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging now intubated.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Patient with less O2
   requirements and improved chest film. [**Month (only) 60**] be able to be extubated later
   today. Will decrease sedation and to a breathing test.
   - f/u sputum Cx & low threshold to start ABx if spikes temp
   - wean sedation, SBT & RSBI
   - continue regular suction & albuterol MDI
   - diuresis goal neg 1-2L
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - f/u Onc recs
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   -f/u WBC and HCT
   # Anemia: Normocytic, normochromic anemia with very high ferritin and
   high TIBC. Most likely due to chronic disease and HCT trending down
   after chemotherapy. HCT 21 today.
   -          Transfuse 2 RBC packs today; goal HCT >21
   -          Follow HCT after transfusion
   .
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  Patient still
   having diarrhea, but no other symptoms. C diff toxin in stool is not
   useful at this point due to recent prior infection. [**Month (only) 60**] need workup for
   chronic diarrhea, but not likely since patient with tube feeds.
   - will keep NPO for now (possible extubation in am)
   - continue po vanco & IV flagyl
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   .
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). Rates have been better controlled on
   current regimen of Metoprolol, Amiodarone & Diltiazem.  No plan for
   anticoagulation due to bloody pericardial effusion.  Currently in NSR
   with rate in 60s.
   - continue Metoprolol & diltiazem & amiodarone
   - f/u repeat EKG
   .
   # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**10-11**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1
   - change out foley now
   - resend UA & Urine Cx
   - hold off on Fluconazole for now
   .
   # F/E/N: IVF prn, NPO for now, OG tube to intermittent suction
   - replete lytes agressively
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy on [**2144-10-9**]. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. The patient was intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 119/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is within normal range at 98%.

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 35 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 24 mEq/L, and oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 324 mmHg.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented to person, but not time or place. Her pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her neck is supple without jugular venous distension or bruits. The heart sounds are regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops. Bilateral lung fields are clear to auscultation and percussion. The abdomen is globous, non-tender, non-distended, and with normal bowel sounds. There"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging now intubated.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Patient with less O2
   requirements and improved chest film. [**Month (only) 60**] be able to be extubated later
   today. Will decrease sedation and to a breathing test.
   - f/u sputum Cx & low threshold to start ABx if spikes temp
   - wean sedation, SBT & RSBI
   - continue regular suction & albuterol MDI
   - diuresis goal neg 1-2L
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - f/u Onc recs
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   -f/u WBC and HCT
   # Anemia: Normocytic, normochromic anemia with very high ferritin and
   high TIBC. Most likely due to chronic disease and HCT trending down
   after chemotherapy. HCT 21 today.
   -          Transfuse 2 RBC packs today; goal HCT >21
   -          Follow HCT after transfusion
   .
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  Patient still
   having diarrhea, but no other symptoms. C diff toxin in stool is not
   useful at this point due to recent prior infection. [**Month (only) 60**] need workup for
   chronic diarrhea, but not likely since patient with tube feeds.
   - will keep NPO for now (possible extubation in am)
   - continue po vanco & IV flagyl
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   .
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). Rates have been better controlled on
   current regimen of Metoprolol, Amiodarone & Diltiazem.  No plan for
   anticoagulation due to bloody pericardial effusion.  Currently in NSR
   with rate in 60s.
   - continue Metoprolol & diltiazem & amiodarone
   - f/u repeat EKG
   .
   # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**10-11**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1
   - change out foley now
   - resend UA & Urine Cx
   - hold off on Fluconazole for now
   .
   # F/E/N: IVF prn, NPO for now, OG tube to intermittent suction
   - replete lytes agressively

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. The patient presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, which led to intubation. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown signs of hypoxia, requiring increased oxygen delivery. The ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis with compensation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate in the 60s, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate in the 16s, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's laboratory values show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, low magnesium, and normal liver function tests. The differential also shows an increased neutrophil count. 

The patient's medical history includes pericardial tamponade, pericardial window, and recent initiation of ICE chemotherapy regimen. The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease and chemotherapy. 

The patient has a history of megacolon and diarrhea, with recent Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently NPO, with plans for OG tube to intermittent suction. 

The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which has been controlled with medication.

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging now intubated.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Patient with less O2
   requirements and improved chest film. Patient was extubated yesterday,
   but became acidotic and retaining CO2 up to a PCO2 of 70 and required
   re-intubation..
   - f/u sputum Cx & low threshold to start ABx if spikes temp
   - wean sedation, SBT & RSBI
   - continue regular suction & albuterol MDI
   - diuresis goal neg 1-2L
   # Fever: Patient spiked a fever of 104, so vancomycin was switched to
   IV; Will continue antibiotics for now.
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - f/u Onc recs
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   -f/u WBC and HCT
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  Patient still
   having diarrhea, but no other symptoms. C diff toxin in stool is not
   useful at this point due to recent prior infection. [**Month (only) 60**] need workup for
   chronic diarrhea, but not likely since patient with tube feeds.
   - will keep NPO for now (possible extubation in am)
   - continue po vanco & IV flagyl
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   .
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). Rates have been better controlled on
   current regimen of Metoprolol, Amiodarone & Diltiazem.  No plan for
   anticoagulation due to bloody pericardial effusion.  Currently in NSR
   with rate in 60s.
   - Metoprolol and diltiazem were stopped today for BP
   - Continue amiodarone
   - f/u repeat EKG
   .
   # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**10-11**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1
   - change out foley now
   - resend UA & Urine Cx
   - hold off on Fluconazole for now
   .
   # F/E/N: IVF prn, NPO for now, OG tube to intermittent suction
   - replete lytes agressively

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. The patient was intubated initially but became acidotic and was retaining CO2, leading to the need for re-intubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/51 mmHg to 161/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 98-98%.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress may be contributing to her low oxygen levels.
2. Fever: The patient had a fever of 104°F, which could indicate an infection.
3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
4. Megacolon/Diarrhea: The patient has a history of volvulus and sigmoid resection, resulting in large dilated loops of colon. She has required intermittent rectal tubes and has been experiencing diarrhea.
5. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient recently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday but experienced increased respiratory rate, secretions, and ultimately required re-intubation. The patient also had hypotension requiring vasopressors, but is now off them. 

The patient has been on invasive ventilation since October 14th at 9:00 PM and a multi-lumen catheter was started on October 15th at 1:57 AM. Blood cultures were taken on October 14th at 11:30 PM.

The patient is receiving several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, metoprolol, furosemide, diltiazem, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory issues mentioned earlier.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
- Heart rate: 61 bpm
- Blood pressure: 111/51 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows mixed venous O2 saturation between 98-98%, with total fluid input and output noted. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube, with a ventilator set at CMV/ASSIST mode, Vt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma who was admitted for respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for intubation indicate potential hypoxia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular chest x-rays and cultures should be done to monitor for any signs of infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin subcutaneous injections should be implemented.
4. Stress ulcers: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at increased risk for stress ulcers due to various factors including critical illness and medication use. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be considered.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic, indicating elevated sodium levels in the blood. Free water boluses through the nasogastric (NG) tube or per oral (PO) may be required to correct this electrolyte imbalance.
6. Chronic diarrhea:"

   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Patient with less O2
   requirements and improved chest film. Patient was extubated yesterday,
   but became acidotic and retaining CO2 up to a PCO2 of 70 and required
   re-intubation..

   - wean sedation, SBT & RSBI
   - continue regular suction & albuterol MDI
   - diuresis goal neg 1-2L
   # Fever: Patient spiked a fever of 104, so vancomycin was switched to
   IV; Will continue antibiotics for now.
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on

   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  Patient still
   having diarrhea, but no other symptoms. C diff toxin in stool is not
   useful at this point due to recent prior infection. [**Month (only) 60**] need workup for
   chronic diarrhea, but not likely since patient with tube feeds.
   - will keep NPO for now (possible extubation in am)
   - continue po vanco & IV flagyl
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   .
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). Rates have been better controlled on
   current regimen of Metoprolol, Amiodarone & Diltiazem.  No plan for
   anticoagulation due to bloody pericardial effusion.  Currently in NSR
   with rate in 60s.
   - Metoprolol and diltiazem were stopped today for BP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma who presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. She was intubated and extubated once, but required re-intubation due to acidosis and carbon dioxide retention. The patient also has a history of megacolon/diarrhea, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and pericardial tamponade. She is currently on invasive ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure is 110/49 mmHg, heart rate is 59 bpm, oxygen saturation is 99%, and temperature is 37.2°C. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and the risk of aspiration, there is a potential for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and the presence of multiple comorbidities increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma who was admitted for respiratory distress due to aspiration and mucus plugging. The patient is now intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of poor eating habits and has had several episodes of diarrhea, including an infection with Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient also has a history of megacolon and sigmoid resection. There are concerns about the patient's fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and nutritional status. The patient has been on chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma and has had complications such as pericardial tamponade and a bloody pericardial effusion. The patient's heart rhythm has been unstable, with episodes of atrial fibrillation, but it is currently in sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic, indicating high levels of sodium in the blood. This could be due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive loss of water from the body. Free water boluses through the NG or OG tube may be required to correct this imbalance.
3. Chronic diarrhea: Despite receiving tube feeds, the patient"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma who presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. He is now intubated and on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of pericardial tamponade, sigmoid resection, and chronic diarrhea. He is currently experiencing fever, hypoxia, hypernatremia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His vital signs are stable, but he has persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and on invasive ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and invasive lines can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and prolonged NPO status may predispose him to stress ulcers.
4. Ventricular arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent rate control measures, there is a potential risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient has positive yeast growth in his sputum culture, indicating a possible fungal infection. Additionally, he has a history of chronic diarrhea and previous urinary tract infections.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma, post chemotherapy, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and failed extubation likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has been intubated and sedated, and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's arterial line access was lost overnight, and she is unable to obtain history due to mental status/intubation. She has multiple IV lines, including a PICC line, invasive ventilation, and an arterial line. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/44 to 132/72 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's physical examination shows CTA (chest X-ray), warm/dry skin, poorly responsive neurologic status, and normal peripheral pulses. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 250 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 1.7 mg/dL, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, and hypernatremia with a sodium level of 122 mEq/L. Radiology images are available. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, resulting in intubation. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, fever, and an elevated white blood cell count. She also has a history of megacolon and diarrhea, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and mucus plugging increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and obtaining sputum cultures is important.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): Given the presence of multiple central lines, there is a risk of CRBSI. Regular assessment of vital signs, blood cultures, and surveillance for signs of infection are essential.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Surveillance for symptoms such as swelling, pain, and warmth in the extremities is recommended.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and immobilization may predispose her to stress"

   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Maintained vent setting
   of [**6-15**] 40% FIO2 overnight, RSB 81 little secretions. Would benefit from
   bronchoscopy given positive cultures and worsening effusions on CXR. If
   bronch unsucessful or unequivocal results, consider CT chest to better
   elucidate the extent of her effusions and consolidations masked by
   fluid overload.

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, resulting in intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxia, fever, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a history of megacolon/diarrhea, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and urinary tract infection.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 112/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been started on total parenteral nutrition (TF) by nutrition recommendations and transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hematocrit (Hct) of 21, now at 27. Her electrolytes have been repleted, and she has received 20 mg of intravenous lasix for negative 1L output.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 179 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of "

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. She was intubated and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases while supine and rhonchi at mid-lung levels. She has petechiae noted on her extremities. Her neurologic examination shows that she is responsive to voice and tactile stimulus. 

Laboratory results indicate a WBC count of 9.7 K/uL, Hct of 29.2%, and platelet count of 117 K/uL. Her electrolytes are within normal range, but she has low albumin levels at 2.3 g/dL. Other lab values are also provided. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current issues include hypoxia, fever, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, h/o megacolon/diarrhea, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, leading to intubation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,556 mL and total output of 3,625 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,069 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab results including liver function tests, kidney function tests, and cardiac enzymes are within normal range.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including hypoxia due to aspiration and mucus plugging, fever with positive sputum culture indicating a possible infection, Hodgkin's lymphoma, a history of pericardial tamponade, and a previous sigmoid resection with megacolon. The patient also has a history of paroxys"

   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging successfully
   extubated yesterday.
    # Initial Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the
   setting of depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Maintained
   vent setting of [**6-15**] 40% FIO2 for over 24hs then successfully extubated.
   Continue with nebs and suctioning prn. Will benefit from continuous
   diuresis as appears to have anasarca and pulmonary edema secondary to
   aggressive fluid repletion during episodes of hypotension.
   - sedating meds d/c in the context of extubation
   - continue regular suction & albuterol nebs
   - continue to diurese pt with goal net negative 1-2L/day, 20mg IV lasix
   usually enough to achieve this goal
   # Fever: Will continue current antibiotics for now given positive
   sputum and septic picture. Currently afebrile with low white blood cell
   count.

   growth.
   -blood culture from [**10-14**] no growth to date
   -urine culture no growth [**10-14**]
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy. Ideally should be
   transfused for hct>30 to maintain oxygenation.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - transfuse for  hct>30
   -f/u WBC and HCT
    # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  Has not had
   issues with diarrhea for the last couple of days.
    - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   -  increase free water bolus as needed for hypernatremia, follow Na
    -continue po vanco & IV flagy
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who was recently diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, for which she required invasive ventilation. She was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient's medical history includes h/o mental retardation, recent diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, and s/p chemotherapy. She also has a history of megacolon/diarrhea, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and pericardial tamponade.

Currently, the patient is being treated for fever with antibiotics, and her sputum culture showed budding yeast with pseudohyphae. She is also on diuretics to maintain a negative fluid balance. Her electrolytes were repleted yesterday, and she is being closely monitored for any potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress, which required invasive ventilation. Although she was successfully extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory distress due to her underlying conditions such as aspiration and mucus plugging.
2. Infection: The patient has been febrile and has shown signs of infection in her sputum culture. She is currently on antibiotics, but there is still a risk of developing further infections, especially considering her immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy.
3. Anasarca and Pulmonary"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging successfully
   extubated yesterday.
    # Initial Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the
   setting of depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Maintained
   vent setting of [**6-15**] 40% FIO2 for over 24hs then successfully extubated.
   Continue with nebs and suctioning prn. Will benefit from continuous
   diuresis as appears to have anasarca and pulmonary edema secondary to
   aggressive fluid repletion during episodes of hypotension.
   - sedating meds d/c in the context of extubation
   - continue regular suction, aggressive chest PT, albuterol nebs
   - continue to diurese pt with goal net negative 1-2L/day, 20mg IV lasix
   usually enough to achieve this goal
   # ID: Initially with fever on presentation, Will continue current
   antibiotics for now given initially septic picture. Currently afebrile
   and now neutropenic
   - on broad spectrum coverage with Cefepime, Vanco
 also being covered
   for c. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanco
   - will not peel back coverage now in the setting of neutropenia,
   however once WBC comes back would consider peeling off antibiotics
   - sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2144-10-16**]):
         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   BUDDING YEAST WITH PSEUDOHYPHAE.
    RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2144-10-18**]):
         OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
         YEAST.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         YEAST.    RARE GROWTH.  2ND TYPE.
   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): no grwoth
   - WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2144-10-17**]):    No significant growth.
   -blood culture from [**10-14**] no growth to date
   -urine culture no growth [**10-14**]
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy. Ideally should be
   transfused for hct>30 to maintain oxygenation.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - crit today is 26, will likely transfuse tomorrow, hold off for today
   - patient is now neutropenic with decreased platelets likely secondary
   to chemo nadir, oncology has been following, aware of this
   pancytopenia, and expect that this is normal
   - on filgrastrim
   - continue to follow serial CBC
    # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  C. diff ordered
   and now pending.
   - pt on definitive treatment for C. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanco
   - patient now extubated, started tube feeds again as per nutrition
   replete with fiber 20 cc/hr advancing to 70cc/hr as tolerated
   - also  free water bolus q 4 hours (350 cc) for hypernatremia, can
   consider lower dose with increased frequency if dificulty tolerating
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
    # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). decision to restart patient on low
   dose beta blocker this morning, already on amiodarone with what appears
   to be good rhythm contorl.
   -continue amiodarone
   - on telemetry
   - beta blocker restarted this AM with holding parameters for heart rate
   and blood pressure, tolerated first dose well
   - repeak EKG as needed
    # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**10-11**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1.  foley was changed out, UA from [**10-13**] was
   negative, urine culture negative, UA not likely source of infection.
    # F/E/N:
   -now extubated, on tube feeds as above with free water flushes for
   hypernatremia
   - on K oncology sliding scale
   - replete lytes agressively

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of malignancy and pancytopenia, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday without any new complaints. He is currently awake, alert, and oriented with no focal neurological findings. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/58 mmHg to 143/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine levels, and hyperglycemia. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, diuretics, and heparin. The plan includes aggressive chest physiotherapy, suctioning, continuation of empiric antibiotic coverage, treatment for Clostridium difficile infection, transfusion if hemoglobin drops below 25%, and continued ICU care. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to increased secretions, worsening pneumonia, and potential need for reintubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may not improve with current antibiotic"

   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging successfully
   extubated yesterday.
    # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Maintained vent setting
   of [**6-15**] 40% FIO2 for over 24hs then successfully extubated. Continue
   with nebs and suctioning prn. Will benefit from continuous diuresis as
   appears to have anasarca and pulmonary edema secondary to  aggressive
   fluid repletion during episodes of hypotension. Now with significant
   improvement in pulmonary status. Provided prn suction is her only
   requirement patient may be able to go to medicine floor today.
   - continue regular suction, aggresstive PT, and nebs prn
   - continue to diurese pt with goal net negative 1-2L/day, 20mg IV lasix
   usually enough to achieve this goal
   # Fever: Initially with fever on presentation, Will continue current
   antibiotics for now given initially septic picture. Currently afebrile
   and now neutropenic.
   -neutropenic precautions
   - on broad spectrum coverage with Cefepime, Vanco
 also being covered
   for c. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanco
   - will not peel back coverage now in the setting of neutropenia,
   however once WBC comes back would consider peeling off antibiotics

   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy. Ideally should be
   transfused for hct>30 to maintain oxygenation.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - crit today is 24, 1U PRBC and recheck hct in PM
   - patient is now neutropenic with decreased platelets likely secondary
   to chemo nadir, oncology has been following, aware of this
   pancytopenia, and expect that this is normal

    # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with c.dif negative.
   - pt on definitive treatment for C. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanco
   - patient now extubated, started tube feeds again as per nutrition
   replete with fiber 20 cc/hr advancing to 70cc/hr as tolerated
   - also  free water bolus q 4 hours (350 cc) for hypernatremia, can
   consider lower dose with increased frequency if dificulty tolerating
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
    # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). decision to restart patient on low
   dose beta blocker this morning, already on amiodarone with what appears
   to be good rhythm contorl.
   -continue amiodarone
   - on telemetry
   - beta blocker restarted this AM with holding parameters for heart rate
   and blood pressure, tolerated first dose well, titrate as BP allows
   - repeak EKG
    # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**10-11**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1.  foley was changed out, UA from [**10-13**] was
   negative, urine culture negative, UA not likely source of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging successfully
   extubated yesterday.
    # Initial Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the
   setting of depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Maintained
   vent setting of [**6-15**] 40% FIO2 for over 24hs then successfully extubated.
   Continue with nebs and suctioning prn. Will benefit from continuous
   diuresis as appears to have anasarca and pulmonary edema secondary to
   aggressive fluid repletion during episodes of hypotension.
   - sedating meds d/c in the context of extubation
   - continue regular suction, aggressive chest PT, albuterol nebs
   - continue to diurese pt with goal net negative 1-2L/day, 20mg IV lasix
   usually enough to achieve this goal
   # ID: Initially with fever on presentation, Will continue current
   antibiotics for now given initially septic picture. Currently afebrile
   and now neutropenic
   - on broad spectrum coverage with Cefepime, Vanco
 also being covered
   for c. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanco
   - will not peel back coverage now in the setting of neutropenia,
   however once WBC comes back would consider peeling off antibiotics
   - sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2144-10-16**]):
         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   BUDDING YEAST WITH PSEUDOHYPHAE.
    RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2144-10-18**]):
         OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
         YEAST.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         YEAST.    RARE GROWTH.  2ND TYPE.
   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): no grwoth
   - WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2144-10-17**]):    No significant growth.
   -blood culture from [**10-14**] no growth to date
   -urine culture no growth [**10-14**]
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy. Ideally should be
   transfused for hct>30 to maintain oxygenation.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - crit today is 26, will likely transfuse tomorrow, hold off for today
   - patient is now neutropenic with decreased platelets likely secondary
   to chemo nadir, oncology has been following, aware of this
   pancytopenia, and expect that this is normal
   - on filgrastrim
   - continue to follow serial CBC
    # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] & [**2144-9-1**].  C. diff ordered
   and now pending.
   - pt on definitive treatment for C. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanco
   - patient now extubated, started tube feeds again as per nutrition
   replete with fiber 20 cc/hr advancing to 70cc/hr as tolerated
   - also  free water bolus q 4 hours (350 cc) for hypernatremia, can
   consider lower dose with increased frequency if dificulty tolerating
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
    # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). decision to restart patient on low
   dose beta blocker this morning, already on amiodarone with what appears
   to be good rhythm contorl.
   -continue amiodarone
   - on telemetry
   - beta blocker restarted this AM with holding parameters for heart rate
   and blood pressure, tolerated first dose well
   - repeak EKG as needed
    # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**10-11**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1.  foley was changed out, UA from [**10-13**] was
   negative, urine culture negative, UA not likely source of infection.
    # F/E/N:
   -now extubated, on tube feeds as above with free water flushes for
   hypernatremia
   - on K oncology sliding scale

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. She presented with acute respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, for which she was intubated. The patient successfully extubated yesterday and continues to benefit from nebulizers and suctioning as needed. She also requires aggressive chest physiotherapy, continuous diuresis with a goal of a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters per day, and close monitoring of her vital signs.

The patient is neutropenic and has a low white blood cell count. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infections. Her blood culture from October 14th shows no growth, as well as her urine culture. Fungal cultures have also been negative.

The patient has a history of megacolon and diarrhea, and recent tests indicate Clostridium difficile infection. She is currently on definitive treatment for C. diff with intravenous Flagyl and oral Vancomycin. Her nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds, which are being advanced gradually.

The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is being monitored on telemetry. She has been restarted on a low dose beta-blocker to control her heart rate. Her electrolyte levels are being aggressively repleted.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and a history of chemotherapy. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. The patient underwent extubation yesterday and is currently doing well.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient presented with acute respiratory distress, likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. She required ventilation support and was successfully extubated. Continuous diuresis is being administered to address pulmonary edema secondary to aggressive fluid repletion during episodes of hypotension.
2. Fever: Initially, the patient had a fever, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started due to a septic picture. Currently, the patient is afebrile but remains neutropenic. Neutropenic precautions are being taken, and if the fever recurs, consideration will be given to adding anti-fungal coverage.
3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient has completed the EACoPP protocol and initiated ICE chemotherapy. WBC count is trending down after chemotherapy. The patient should be transfused for an Hct>30 to maintain oxygenation.
4. Megacolon/Diarrhea: The patient underwent volvulous and sigmoid resection with large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films. She has required intermittent rectal tubes, and currently, she is experiencing a lot of stool"

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 59yo woman with MR, refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma c/b
   pericardial tamponade s/p window, pA fib and other issues here with
   respiratory failure.
   A/P:
   1) Respiratory failure: Resolved currently -- off vent for several
   days, tolerating low supplement oxygen. Suctioning and chest PT
   requirements have decreased. Possibly due to pneumonia which appears to
   have resolved.
   2) ID: Continuing Vanc and Cefepime IV given she is persistently
   neutropenic. Continues on Vanc PO and Flagyl IV for presumptive C diff
   in the setting of of dilated colon. If she were to spike a fever, the
   next empiric treatment would be anti-fungals.
   3) Onc: S/p chemo now in neutropenic nadir. Continue neupogen.
   Transfuse as needed for goal Hct > 21%.
   4) CV: Continue Amio, titrate up beta-blocker as needed. Given good
   response to this dose will hold her dose / frequency for now and
   titrate as needed.
   5) Neuro: Lower extremity weakness likely [**3-14**] deconditioning, will need
   aggressive PT. No e/o a localizing lesion or deficit that would invoke
   a spinal cord process. Monitor and continue daily assessment in the
   setting of PT.
   6) F/E/N: Continue feeds, follow replete 'lytes.
   7) Code: DNR not DNI. Access: RIJ --> will request PICC for now. Dispo:
   Called out to floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a medical history of refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma, pericardial tamponade, atrial fibrillation, and other unspecified issues. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, which has since resolved. The patient continues to be neutropenic and is receiving antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime IV), as well as oral vancomycin and Flagyl IV for a presumptive diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection. Her current medications include metoprolol, heparin sodium, protonix, Flagyl, Vanc PO, acyclovir, Bactrim, amio, cefepime, and neupogen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/60 to 129/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. Lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose levels between 114-152 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are negative. The impression is that the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and she is tolerating low"
