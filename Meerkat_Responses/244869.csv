   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of dementia who
   presents with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely [**12-26**] aspiration pneumonia as patient
   was afebrile, with 10 bands on differential and sputum culture with 2+
   GPCs in pairs, chains and clusters and known aspiration risk.  Patient
   has weaned on vent well overnight, but his CXR looks worse and his
   sputum remains thick requiring suctioning so he will likely not be
   extubatable today
   - continue ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and vancomycin (day 2)
   - cont mechanical ventilation, daily RSBI and wake up, wean fi02 as
   tolerated, PS as tolerated today, repeat ABG on PS.
   - continue sedation with fentanyl and versed
   -f/u urine culture, blood culture and final sputum culture
   - VAP prophylaxis
   - combivent inhalers prn
   .
   # Hypotension : Hypotension persisted after sedating medications wore
   off, but responded to 1.5 L NS and patient now normotensive fo >12
   hours.
   - abx as above
   - NS bolus prn for MAP<65 or UOP<30
   .
   # h/o SBT : On admission there was concern for partial SBO given NGT
   drainage and distended abdomen. Pt has been having stools at home, no
   history of vomiting. OG tube now with minimal to no drainage.  Tube
   feeds started last night and patient tolerating well so no signs of SBP
   - continue tube feeds with q4h residual checks
   -monitor abdominal exam
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: holding zocor while NPO

   # FEN: fluids prn, replete lytes prn, tube feeds

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 70 yo M with alzheimers dementia
   (noncommunicative at baseline) presents with respiratory failure in
   setting of pna.  Weaned overnight to PS 5/5.  MAPS responded to IVF
   boluses.

   felt [**12-26**] sedation and sepsis/infection. MAPS have been fluid responsive
   (goal > 65) and has not required pressor support. Making good urine
   with stable bun/cr. Would recheck lactate.  As WBC increased from 5 to
   10
 recheck differential noting bandemia on admit.  Tolerating TFs
   without residuals with benign abd exam.  Follow serial exam and lactate
   as above.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presents with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's condition is complicated by aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of GPCs in pairs, clusters, and chains in the sputum culture. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement overnight, but the chest X-ray indicates worsening of the condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/62 to 111/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels, but elevated lactate and creatinine levels. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone, as well as sedation with fentanyl and versed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requiring intubation indicates a potential complication related to impaired gas exchange and ventilation.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The presence of GPCs in pairs, clusters, and chains in the sputum culture suggests an aspiration event leading to pneumonia. This can result in lung infection and worsening respiratory status.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presents with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, OGT drainage, hyperlipidemia, and FEN. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the presence of 2+ GPCs in pairs, chains, and clusters in the sputum culture. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and daily RSBI assessment will be important to identify any potential complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, including fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate administration of antibiotics are crucial to manage this condition.
3. OGT drainage: The patient initially had concerns for partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to nasogastric tube drainage and a distended abdomen. However, the patient is now tolerating tube feeds well, and ongoing monitoring of the abdominal exam is necessary to detect any changes.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, and holding Zocor while the patient is NPO is recommended. Monitoring lipid levels and restarting Zocor once tube feeds are established may be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of dementia who
   presents with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.

   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely [**12-26**] aspiration pneumonia as patient
   was afebrile, with 10 bands on differential and sputum culture with 2+
   GPCs in pairs, chains and clusters and known aspiration risk.  Patient
   has weaned on vent well overnight, but his CXR looks worse and his
   sputum remains thick requiring suctioning so he will likely not be
   extubatable today
   - continue ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and vancomycin (day 2)
   - cont mechanical ventilation, daily RSBI and wake up, wean fi02 as
   tolerated, PS as tolerated today, repeat ABG on PS.
   - continue sedation with fentanyl and versed
   -f/u urine culture, blood culture and final sputum culture
   - VAP prophylaxis
   - combivent inhalers prn
   .
   # Hypotension : Hypotension persisted after sedating medications wore
   off, but responded to 1.5 L NS and patient now normotensive fo >12
   hours.
   - abx as above
   - NS bolus prn for MAP<65 or UOP<30
   .
   # h/o SBT : On admission there was concern for partial SBO given NGT
   drainage and distended abdomen. Pt has been having stools at home, no
   history of vomiting. OG tube now with minimal to no drainage.  Tube
   feeds started last night and patient tolerating well so no signs of SBP
   - continue tube feeds with q4h residual checks
   -monitor abdominal exam

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presented with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and vancomycin) for suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with less wheezing on examination. There are no other sources of infection identified.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which was initially responsive to fluid boluses. No additional intravenous fluids have been required in the past 24 hours.

The patient has a history of bowel obstruction (SBO) as evidenced by a distended abdomen and absence of bowel movements for two days. However, the patient tolerated tube feeding well, with bowel sounds present.

Other findings include hyperlipidemia, for which the patient is holding Zocor while being NPO. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range.

The patient has been placed on various prophylactic measures, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of dementia and current respiratory failure suggest a high risk of aspiration, leading to aspiration pneumonia. This is supported by the presence of 10 bands"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of dementia who
   presents with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely [**12-26**] aspiration pneumonia as patient
   was afebrile, with 10 bands on differential and sputum culture with
   known aspiration risk.  No temps, bancemia resolving.  Sputum with OP
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be useful in determining infectious source as may be
   contaminant. Patient doing well on PS with appopriate RISBI, unable to
   obtain ABG due to PVD. Clinical exam improved today with less wheezing.
   No other sources of infection. growth on urine cx
s, blood cultures
   NGTD. Looks  volume overloaded on CXR.
   - continue ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and vancomycin (day 3)
   - cont mechanical ventilation, daily RSBI and wake up, wean fi02 as
   tolerated, PS.
   - check VBG => SBT today with possible extubation if patient does not
   appear hypercarbic.
   - f/u final sputum culture and repeat sputum prior to extubation.
   - VAP prophylaxis
   - combivent inhalers prn
   - diurese as needed after extubation.
   - check diff tomorrow AM to ensure resolution of bandemia.
   # Hypotension : Patient met criteria for sepsis in the ED; hypotension
   was responsive to fluid boluses. No IVFs required x24 hrs.
   # h/o SBT : distended abdomen => c/f SBO (no BMs x2 days). Tolerated
   TFs well, with bowel sounds.
   - continue tube feeds with q4h residual checks
   -monitor abdominal exam
   - add senna to  bowel regimen
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: holding zocor while NPO

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of dementia who
   presents with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely [**12-26**] aspiration pneumonia as patient
   was afebrile, with 10 bands on differential and sputum culture with 2+
   GPCs in pairs, chains and clusters and known aspiration risk.  Patient
   has weaned on vent well overnight, but his CXR looks worse and his
   sputum remains thick requiring suctioning so he will likely not be
   extubatable today
   - continue ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and vancomycin (day 2)
   - cont mechanical ventilation, daily RSBI and wake up, wean fi02 as
   tolerated, PS as tolerated today, repeat ABG on PS.
   - continue sedation with fentanyl and versed
   -f/u urine culture, blood culture and final sputum culture
   - VAP prophylaxis
   - combivent inhalers prn
   # Hypotension : Hypotension persisted after sedating medications wore
   off, but responded to 1.5 L NS and patient now normotensive fo >12
   hours.
   - abx as above
   - NS bolus prn for MAP<65 or UOP<30
   # h/o SBT : On admission there was concern for partial SBO given NGT
   drainage and distended abdomen. Pt has been having stools at home, no
   history of vomiting. OG tube now with minimal to no drainage.  Tube
   feeds started last night and patient tolerating well so no signs of SBP

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presented with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, as evidenced by his symptoms, sputum culture results, and risk factors. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and vancomycin). His vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires careful monitoring. The patient is also experiencing hyperlipidemia, which is being managed by holding Zocor while he is NPO. Other concerns include potential small bowel obstruction (SBO) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's condition will be closely monitored, with plans for weaning off sedation and potentially extubation in the future. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period. Prophylactic measures such as head-of-bed elevation, daily sedation breaks, and regular respiratory system assessment are being implemented to minimize this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is being administered to reduce this risk.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation can predispose patients to stress ulcers. Pantop"

","The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presents with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is tolerating tube feeds well. His labs show resolving leukocytosis and bandemia, as well as normal kidney function. The patient's chest X-ray indicates multifocal pneumonia and small effusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection acquired after at least 48 hours of mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism if they travel to the lungs.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from lying in one position for extended periods can cause pressure ulcers, which are painful sores that form on the skin.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immune system may be weakened due to the underlying conditions and medications, making him more susceptible to nosocomial infections, such as urinary tract infections or central line-associated bloodstream infections.
5. Delirium: Patients with dementia are at higher risk of developing delir"

   Most likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia as patient was afebrile,
   with 10% bands on differential and with known aspiration risk.
   Afebrile with bandemia resolving.  Two separate sputum gram stains,
   [**11-19**] showing GPCs and [**11-21**] showing GNRs. [**11-19**] sputum culture shows
   final result of sparse oropharyngeal growth.  [**11-21**] sputum culture
   shows preliminary result of rare oropharyngeal organisms and yeast.
   Speech and swallow consult this AM revealed that patient unsafe for
   oral intake.
   - Discontinue ceftriaxone and vancomycin given no culture data to
   support ongoing use.
   - Continue levofloxacin (day 4)
   - Follow-up final sputum culture from [**11-21**]
   - Oral care while NPO
   - Consider NG tube and then begin feeding via NGT. Should initiate
   family discussion regarding patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presented with acute respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient is currently extubated and on face mask ventilation. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of GPCs and GNRs in his sputum gram stains and the growth of oropharyngeal organisms in his sputum culture. The patient's speech and swallow consult revealed that he is unsafe for oral intake. He has been prescribed levofloxacin and his antibiotic regimen has been adjusted based on the sputum culture results. The patient also has anemia, likely due to chronic disease, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently receiving IV fluids and his HCT level is being monitored. The patient's condition is stable, and he is planned to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia indicate a risk for further respiratory infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is crucial.
2. Aspiration: Due to the patient's known aspiration risk and unsafe swallow study results, there is a potential for recurrent aspiration events, which could lead to further respiratory compromise or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygen carrying capacity and potential tissue hypoxia.
4. Hyperlipidemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presented with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. He is currently extubated and on face mask ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. His clinical exam has improved, with less wheezing. However, he appears to be volume overloaded on chest X-ray. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 169/87 to 100/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was previously intubated and is now on face mask ventilation. There is a risk of developing VAP due to the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Volume overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded based on the chest X-ray. This can lead to respiratory distress and pulmonary edema.
3. Aspiration: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrent aspiration events while he is on face mask ventilation.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is low at 33%. It is important to explore other etiologies for anemia, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
5. Deep vein thrombosis ("
