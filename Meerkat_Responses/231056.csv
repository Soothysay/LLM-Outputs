   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who presented with fevers, cough, myalgias, and a frontal headache. He was tachypneic and desaturating upon arrival, so he was placed on 100% NRB, started on CTX/azithro/tamiflu, and had a chest X-ray showing increased interstitial markings. Due to increasing respiratory distress, the patient was intubated.

The patient has a history of cardiac disease, including mitral valve prolapse, and possible right ventricular dysfunction. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/76 mmHg to 137/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 54 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen delivery and has been intubated.

Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, crackles in the chest, and no lower extremity edema. The patient is sedated and unresponsive, with no neurological assessment possible at this time. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.1 K/uL, anemia with an Hct of 36.0%, thrombocytosis with a Plt count of 303 K/uL, normal electroly"

   Bladder U/S: IMPRESSION: Mixed echogenic material within the dependent
   portion of the bladder. No definite color flow. These findings are most
   suggestive of clot, although underlying mass lesion cannot be entirely
   excluded. Short-term interval followup or direct visualization with
   cystoscopy is recommended.
   TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated mitral annuloplasty ring
   with increased gradient and mild mitral stenosis. Moderate puomonary
   artery systolic hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
   mild free wall hypokinesis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-10-24**], the
   transmitral gradient is lower, but with smaller estimated mitral valve
   area. The right ventricular cavity is slightly larger now with free
   wall hypokinesis. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
   similar.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and mitral valve prolapse, admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He is now intubated for respiratory fatigue and tachypnea. The patient is tolerating the ventilator well, but has spiked a fever overnight. Cultures from blood, sputum, and urine have been sent, and will be re-cultured if another temperature spike occurs. The patient is on fentanyl and versed, with plans to wean sedation as tolerated. There are concerns about pneumonia, and azithromycin and ceftriaxone have been continued for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A chest X-ray will be done tomorrow morning. The patient appears to have volume overload on the chest X-ray, so IV fluids have been held. The patient's neurologist has been notified about his hospitalization and recommends avoiding neuroleptics while continuing home Parkinson's medications. A trans-thoracic echo (TTE) showed well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring with increased gradient and mild mitral stenosis, as well as moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and right ventricular cavity enlargement with mild free wall hypokinesis. The patient has hematuria and a Foley catheter was placed, but there is evidence of clot in the bladder. The patient's allergies include mango flavor (hives) and chocolate flavor ("

   Urine: blood large, without evidence of infection
   CXR: increased blossoming of right lower lobe infiltrate
   Bladder U/S: IMPRESSION: Mixed echogenic material within the dependent
   portion of the bladder. No definite color flow. These findings are most
   suggestive of clot, although underlying mass lesion cannot be entirely
   excluded. Short-term interval followup or direct visualization with
   cystoscopy is recommended.
   TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated mitral annuloplasty ring
   with increased gradient and mild mitral stenosis. Moderate puomonary
   artery systolic hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
   mild free wall hypokinesis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-10-24**], the
   transmitral gradient is lower, but with smaller estimated mitral valve
   area. The right ventricular cavity is slightly larger now with free
   wall hypokinesis. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
   similar.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. He was admitted with two days of influenza-like illness and difficulty breathing. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory fatigue and tachypnea. 

Key findings and assessments include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not associated with ARDS. 
2. Fever: The patient has had two episodes of fever, which is concerning for an infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient likely has pneumonia, and the culture results are pending. 
4. Cardiac status: The patient has increased pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, right ventricular cavity enlargement with mild free wall hypokinesis, and well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring with increased gradient and mild mitral stenosis. 
5. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, which could be due to a clot in the bladder. Further evaluation with cystoscopy is recommended. 
6. Parkinson's disease: The patient's neurologist should be updated on his hospitalization, as Parkinson's medications should be continued exactly on the home schedule. 

The patient is currently receiving various treatments, including antibiotics for pneumonia, supportive therapy with Tylenol PRN, gentle IV fluids, inhaled bronchodilators as needed, and weaning off FiO2. The plan is to continue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and mitral valve prolapse (MVP). He was admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory fatigue and tachypnea. His fever spiked again yesterday. The patient has been tolerating the ventilator well, as indicated by the recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results. Cultures from blood, sputum, and urine have been obtained, and they are pending. The patient is being treated with azithromycin and cefepime due to the presence of Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum, to cover for pseudomonas. Nebulizations of ipratropium and albuterol are given as needed. The patient is on fentanyl and midazolam (versed), but sedation is being weaned vigorously as tolerated. The patient is now undergoing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and consideration for extubation will be made based on mental status and the ability to manage copious beige frothy secretions. Lasix has been administered to reduce fluid overload, and reassessment will be done in the afternoon with potential redosing as needed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. Continued respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulators (DBS) admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea. 

The patient has been tolerating the ventilator well, as evidenced by the recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results. However, the patient has spiked another fever yesterday. Cultures from blood, sputum, and urine have been obtained, and re-culture will be done if there is another temperature spike. The patient is being treated with azithromycin and cefepime, which are antibiotics, due to the presence of gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum. This is being done to cover for pseudomonas.

Supportive treatment includes the use of tylenol as needed for fever, ipratropium and albuterol nebs as needed for respiratory symptoms, and a gradual weaning of sedation. However, the patient is not currently being weaned off the ventilator due to copious beige frothy secretions. Lasix has been given to aim for a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters today.

The patient also has a probable pneumonia, for which azithromycin and cefepime will be continued, and a chest X-ray will be obtained tomorrow morning.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS) who was admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He was intubated on [**11-20**] for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, respiratory failure, and probable pneumonia. His fever has been intermittent, and he has shown spikes in temperature overnight. Cultures from blood, sputum, and urine have been obtained, and re-culture is planned if another temperature spike occurs.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 50%. His RSBI is 114, and he has rhonchi bilaterally anteriorly. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.1Â°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 136/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL and a decreased hematocrit level of 33.8%. His platelet count is within normal range at 348 K/uL. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS), admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He is currently intubated for respiratory fatigue and tachypnea. The patient has been tolerating the ventilator well, but has had a fever overnight. Cultures have been obtained from blood, sputum, and urine, and re-culture is planned if another temperature spike occurs. Antibiotics have been started to cover Gram-negative rods, including pseudomonas, and MRSA pneumonia. Secretions are being managed with ipratropium and albuterol nebs as needed, and a bronchoscopy will be performed to clean out secretions. The patient's mental status and ability to manage secretions will be evaluated before considering extubation. 

The patient is also being treated for probable pneumonia, with antibiotics covering community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including azithromycin and cefepime, and vancomycin has been added. A chest X-ray (CXR) has been done, and another sputum sample for culture has been sent. There is evidence of volume overload on CXR, and the patient has received copious fluids, including 3L in the emergency department. IV fluids have been held, and diuretics have been held as well, as the patient appears relatively euvolemic today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS) who was admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He is now intubated for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea. The patient has a fever and is showing signs of respiratory failure. His mental status is altered but not delirious. He has a history of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), chronic constipation, and hematuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have pneumonia, and appropriate antibiotics have been started. There is a concern for MRSA pneumonia, so vancomycin has been added to the treatment regimen.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure needs to be closely monitored, especially since he is intubated. Extubation may be considered pending mental status and ability to manage copious secretions.
3. Volume Overload: There is evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray, which may require diuretics or fluid restriction.
4. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, possibly due to a Foley catheter placement. Continuous bladder irrigation is being continued, and the Foley catheter should be assessed regularly.
5. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease medications should be continued as per his home schedule, and his neurologist should be consulted regarding any neurologic recommendations.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS) who was admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He is currently intubated for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea. The patient has been tolerating the ventilator well, but has had a fever overnight. He has copious secretions and his mental status is altered. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, mitral valve prolapse, anxiety, and hematuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may lead to further complications if not properly managed. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation suggests pneumonia, which can worsen if not treated appropriately. Appropriate antibiotics should be administered based on sputum culture results.
3. Cardiac Status: The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored due to evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray and the presence of hypertension and mitral valve prolapse. Fluid management needs to be carefully managed to avoid cardiac complications.
4. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria should be evaluated further to determine the underlying cause. Ongoing irrigation of the Foley catheter is recommended.
5. Parkinson's Disease Management: The patient's Parkinson's disease medications should be continued as per his home schedule to manage his symptoms effectively.
6. Anxiety: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and a history of PA-HTN. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/65 to 145/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is mechanically ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 set at 50%, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and RSBI of 114.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion with rhonchorous breath sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and no neurological assessment due to sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was intubated on [**11-20**] for tachypnea and fatigue. The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and difficulty breathing. He has been receiving mechanical ventilation support and has been sedated with propofol.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have pneumonia as indicated by his symptoms of fever, altered mental status, and difficulty breathing. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) to cover for gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to ARDS. He requires continuous oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation support.

3. Volume Overload: The patient shows evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray. This may be due to the administration of copious fluids during his hospitalization.

4. Hematuria: The patient presents with hematuria, which may be related to his recent Foley catheter placement. A urinary tract infection or kidney injury could be contributing factors.

5. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and is currently experiencing increased anxiety due to his hospitalization and mechanical ventilation."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS), admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing, now intubated for tachypnea/fatigue. The patient has been tolerating the ventilator well, with recent vital signs including a temperature of 101.5Â°F, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's physical examination revealed no peripheral vascular or skin abnormalities, and their neurologic status was not assessed. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), along with normal hemoglobin (Hct) levels. Other lab results include normal blood glucose levels, slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) and total CO2 (TCO2), and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient has several medical problems, including altered mental status (not delirium), respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), hematuria, probable pneumonia, cardiac/volume status, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, access issues, nutrition, prophylaxis, and contact information. The patient's current medications include azithromycin, cefepime, vancomycin, ipratropium, albuterol nebs prn, propofol drip with bolus fentanyl, and"

","The patient is a 61-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who is experiencing acute respiratory failure due to likely pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU and has a history of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has a fever of 101.5Â°F and is showing signs of improved clinical condition, including decreased secretions and better oxygen saturation levels.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/52 mmHg to 141/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His temperature is 38.3Â°C (101Â°F).

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, intubation, and sedation. His breath sounds are rhonchorous and scattered, indicating the presence of fluid or mucus in the lungs. He has trace edema in both lower extremities and warm skin. Neurological examination shows no attentiveness, inability to follow simple commands, and no assessed movement or tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 13.1 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 10.3 g/dL, normal platelet count (Plt) at 348 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) at 1.1 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels ranging from 92 to 144 mg/dL. Other lab"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 61-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS), admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He is intubated for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea.
- The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- He is tolerating the ventilator well, but has had fevers and increased respiratory secretions.
- Cultures from bronchoscopy, blood, sputum, and urine have been taken, and re-culture will be done later today if he spikes another temperature.
- The patient is being treated with antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) to cover for gram-negative bacteria (GNR) in the sputum and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.
- He is also receiving ipratropium and albuterol nebs as needed.
- The plan for extubation includes starting premedex to help with anxiety, weaning down propofol, and providing clonazepam (Klonopin) as needed for anxiety.
- The patient's mental status, improved anxiety, and ability to manage improved secretions will be assessed before considering extubation.
- There is evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray, so IV fluids have been held.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [**11-20**] for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea. Although they were extubated on [**11-25**], there is a concern for potential respiratory failure due to pneumonia and altered mental status.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, as evidenced by fever, leukocytosis, diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray, and Gram stain and culture results from bronchoalveolar lavage showing no microorganisms but 4+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

3. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient's sodium levels have been rising over the past five days (141 -> 146), indicating hypernatremia. This may be due to fluid overload and excessive intake of hypertonic fluids.

4. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, which is not delirium. This could be related to the underlying medical conditions, medication side effects, or complications from intubation.

5. Hematuria: The patient presents with hematuria, which may be associated with a urinary tract infection or other renal issues. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

6. Cardiac volume status: The patient shows evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray and has received copious fluids, including 3 liters in the emergency department. Appropriate fluid management should be implemented to prevent further complications.

7. Parkinson's disease management: The patient has Parkinson's disease and requires specific management of his condition while hospitalized. His neurologist recommends continuing all home Parkinson's medications on their regular schedule.

8. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and requires ongoing management with medications such as klonopin and Zoloft.

9. Access: The patient has peripheral IV lines in place for medication administration.

10. Nutrition: The patient started tube feeds and RISS (presumably a nutrition regimen) based on nutrition recommendations yesterday. Tube feeding may need to be adjusted based on the patient's sodium levels and overall condition.

Please note that this is a summary of the potential medical complications based on the provided information. Additional assessments and investigations may be necessary to confirm these complications and guide appropriate treatment."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to likely pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, and although he has been extubated, he still requires supplemental oxygen. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening respiratory failure if his condition does not improve.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, the pneumonia could progress, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential sepsis.

3. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, but it is not described as delirium. Delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients, characterized by confusion, disorientation, and fluctuating levels of consciousness.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to various complications such as dehydration, neurological issues, and kidney problems.

5. Hematuria: The presence of blood in the urine (hematuria) may indicate a urinary tract infection or other kidney-related issues.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Critically ill patients, especially those immobilized or bedridden,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS) who was admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He was intubated for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea due to pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 121/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.3 K/uL and elevated lactate levels at 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab results show slightly abnormal values for sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium.

Radiology images reveal bilateral focal parenchymal opacities on chest X-ray (CXR) but no evidence of pleural effusion or cardiac silhouette changes.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for pneumonia with cefepime and vancomycin, as well as bronchoscopy cultures. The patient also has a history of diarrhea, cardiac volume status concerns, Parkinson's disease management, anxiety, hematuria, access issues, nutrition, prophylactic antibiotic, and contact information for the patient's wife.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, progression of pneumonia, development"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS) who was admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He was intubated for respiratory fatigue and tachypnea due to pneumonia. The patient tolerated the ventilator well but experienced episodes of respiratory distress, anxiety, and wheezing. He was extubated on [**11-25**] and received cefepime and vancomycin for pneumonia. The patient also had diarrhea, evidence of volume overload, and hematuria post Foley placement. His Parkinson's disease medications were continued as recommended by his neurologist. The patient is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with pneumonia, which led to respiratory distress and intubation. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia or development of new infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immunosuppression from antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient had episodes of respiratory distress, which may be related to his Parkinson's disease, anxiety, or underlying lung pathology. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.
3. Diarrhea: The patient developed diarrhea with loose stools, fever, and leukocytosis. This could be due to Clostridium difficile infection, especially considering the recent antibiotic use. Appropriate testing and treatment should be initiated promptly.

","The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease, presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to likely pneumonia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently extubated but still experiencing episodes of tachypnea. The patient is receiving morphine as needed for pain relief and diuretics overnight. He is being continued on vancomycin and cefepime, and his condition will be closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxemic respiratory failure, which indicates a potential risk of recurring respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have pneumonia, which can lead to worsening lung infection and further respiratory distress.
3. Hypernatremia (high sodium levels): The patient's sodium level is elevated, which may be due to dehydration or other underlying conditions. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma if left untreated.
4. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be attributed to various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or complications from Parkinson's disease. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure the patient's cognitive functions do not deteriorate further.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins, particularly due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures like"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia and respiratory failure. They have a history of tachypnea, which responded to morphine and lasix. The patient has allergies to mango flavor, unknown hives, and chocolate flavor, along with runny. The last dose of antibiotics was administered on [**2201-11-27**] at 05:28 AM (Cefipime) and 08:00 AM (Vancomycin). The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (lasix), and morphine sulfate.

The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for the episode of tachypnea and the current respiratory status. The patient is comfortable without any pain and appears attentive with normal heart rhythm.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, within normal limits. The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,788 mL total in, with outputs of 1,175 mL urine and 1,705 mL blood products. The respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, and the patient's ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat; symmetric breath sounds with"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease (PD) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He was intubated for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea and diagnosed with pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and Parkinson's disease.

The patient's current condition includes:

- Impaired airway clearance
- Impaired balance
- Impaired gait
- Impaired motor function
- Impaired posture
- Impaired transfers
- Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia
- Hypernatremia (high sodium levels)
- Altered mental status (not delirium)
- Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS)

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been extubated once but required reintubation. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) to cover for potential pseudomonas infection and MRSA pneumonia. Nebulized ipratropium and albuterol are given as needed for respiratory distress. The patient is also receiving Lasix to manage fluid overload and morphine for anxiety-related respiratory distress.

Other medical issues include diarrhea, cardiac volume status, Parkinson's disease management, anxiety, and hematuria. The patient's Foley catheter has been removed, and continuous bladder irrigation has been turned off. A peripher"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease (PD) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He is currently intubated for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea due to pneumonia.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications:

1. Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: The patient was intubated on [11-20] for respiratory fatigue/tachypnea. He is tolerating the ventilator well, but there is a concern for potential respiratory failure. The patient has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is being treated with cefepime and vancomycin.

2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has high serum sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia. This may be related to dehydration or inadequate fluid management.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is not delirium. It is important to monitor his mental status closely.

4. Diarrhea: The patient has loose stool, fever, and leukocytosis. Although the initial c.diff test was negative, another c.diff test should be sent.

5. Cardiac History: The patient has a history of MVP (mitral valve prolapse) and is taking home ASA 81 mg and crestor.

6. Parkinson's Disease (PD): The patient has PD and is on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease (PD) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), admitted with two days of influenza-like illness (ILI) and difficulty breathing. He was intubated for tachypnea/fatigue with pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and is tolerating the ventilator well. He has been on a 14-day course of antibiotics for pneumonia, which includes cefepime and vancomycin. The patient's respiratory distress episodes seem to have an anxiety component, for which he is given morphine as needed. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient was admitted with ILI and difficulty breathing, leading to intubation for tachypnea/fatigue with pneumonia. He is currently on a 14-day course of antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had acute respiratory failure and was intubated. However, he tolerated the ventilator well and was later extubated.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may require careful management of fluid balance.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has impaired mental status, but it is not delirium.
5. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria initially but it has resolved.
6. Diarrhea: The patient had loose stools, fever, and leukocytosis, but c.diff negative.
