   [**2141-3-14**] TTE: The left ventricular cavity is dilated. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
   to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Focused views. Severe left
   ventricular sysolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-3-9**], this is a
   limited/emergent/focused study and direct comparison cannot be made.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV
   ICD implanation, CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b
   VT arrest this AM.
   .
   # s/p VT arrest:
   Will aim to wean lido gtt and possibly restart mexilitine.
   - TSH wnl
   - will discuss further with EP service
   # s/p intubation: Aim for extubation today, on minimal settings.
   .
   # CAD: - current chest pain is focal and likely related to CPR and
   shocks.
   - continue aspirin/statin.  Holding beta blocker as above.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - trend biomarkers
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Had resolved prior to transfer to CCU.
   History appears similar to prior episode in [**1-20**].  Symptoms and labs
   felt to be c/w pancreatitis.  No cholethiasis apprecaited on abdominal
   u/s.  C. diff negative x1.
   - OG tube in place
   - Continue PPI, sucralfate, antiemetics per home regimen
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF.  The patient has known severe HK and AK of LV
   c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.  After
   discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during today's code showed
   worsened LV function.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - Consider diuresis today if poor UOP though this may be post-arrest
   ATN.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likley [**2-13**] ATN, hypoperfusion during
   code
   -          continue to follow
   -          avoid nephrotoxins
   -          renally dose meds
   -          Check urine lytes
   -
   #Thrombocytopenia: Repeat in pm
   .
   # Anxiety: not acute issue
   .
   # FEN: NPO, OG tube in place
   - Follow lytes and replete aggressively.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin subq, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # CODE: full confirmed with patient by [**Hospital Unit Name 4282**] team.  Will rediscuss with
   patient once able.   Patient is not interested in catheterization,
   valvuloplasty, or ablation procedures according to discussion with his

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) post-biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (afib). He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest this morning.

The patient has undergone multiple procedures including intubation, administration of medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, amiodarone, lidocaine, heparin, and others. He also received an echocardiogram which showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. S/p VT arrest: Aim to wean lidocaine and possibly restart mexilitine.
2. S/p intubation: Aim for extubation today on minimal settings.
3. CAD: Continue aspirin and statin. Hold beta-blocker as above. Cautious use of sublingual nitroglycerin if chest pain recurs given severe aortic stenosis. Monitor on telemetry and trend biomarkers.
4. Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Symptoms and labs consistent with pancreatitis. Continue"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV
   ICD implanation, CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b
   VT arrest this AM.
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: This AM with unclear precipitant.  He had been feeling
   well without chest pain or shortness of breath.  Unlikely ischemic
   event and clinically more consistent with scar.  Electrolytes were
   within normal limits and patient had not missed any of his
   anti-arrhythmics.  VT was below the detection rate of the ICD, easily
   paced out but recurrent until patient was started on Lido/Amio gtts.
   Currently paced at rate of 75.  Of note, patient has history of
   difficult to control VT - he had previously been treated with
   amiodarone however this interfered with the detection by the
   pacemaker.  For this reason he was started on mexilitine and sotalol
   previously.
   - Continue lidocaine, amiodarone gtts for now.  Will defer to EP
   regarding future anti-arrhythmic therapy.   EP may want to test device
   in the future.
   - Levophed to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will not cycle cardiac enzymes as patient is not willing to undergo
   catheterization if positive.  This has been discussed with him by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Currently intubated for airway protection, wean vent as tolerated.
   Likely keep intubated overnight.
   - No need for cooling given patient's current responsiveness.
   - Check TSH, dig level
   - Will hold sotalol, mexilitine for now.  Do not want to double up on
   medications.
   - Follow LFTs, creatinine post arrest.  High risk for acute renal
   failure.
   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU setting.
   .
   # s/p intubation: For airway protection but no evidence of respiratory
   failure.  Last ABG was 7.43/48/200.  CXR shows ET tube 3.1 cm above
   carina.
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexidine
   - Consider extubation in AM.  SBT today.
   .
   # CAD: Patient has known 2vd and is s/p CABG [**2133**].  He reported CP at
   rest prior to this admission, CP free this admission with negative
   biomarkers.  Myocardial viability study revealed some viability defect
   within the inferior wall defect - minimal.  Patient refused
   valvulplasty and angioplasy.  Biomarkers elevated but unlikely to
   change management since pt has refused cath and interventions. Will
   trend
   - continue aspirin/statin.  Holding beta blocker as above.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - trend biomarkers
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Had resolved prior to transfer to CCU.
   History appears similar to prior episode in [**1-20**].  Symptoms and labs

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of ~20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest this morning. The cause of the VT arrest is unclear, but it is more consistent with scar-mediated VT rather than an ischemic event. The patient has a history of difficult-to-control VT and has been treated with various anti-arrhythmic medications.

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and being weaned off mechanical ventilation as tolerated. It is likely that he will remain intubated overnight. Other assessments and plans include:

1. The patient's cardiac enzymes are being trended, but he is not willing to undergo catheterization if positive. This has been discussed with him by Dr. [First Name (STitle)].
2. Levophed is being used to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) >65.
3. The patient's anti-arrhythmic medications, lidocaine and amiodarone, will be continued for now, and future anti-arrhythmic therapy will be deferred to an"

   with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
   to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Focused views. Severe left
   ventricular sysolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-3-9**], this is a
   limited/emergent/focused study and direct comparison cannot be made.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV
   ICD implanation, CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b
   VT arrest this AM.
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: This AM with unclear precipitant.  He had been feeling
   well without chest pain or shortness of breath.  Unlikely ischemic
   event and clinically more consistent with scar.  Electrolytes were
   within normal limits and patient had not missed any of his
   anti-arrhythmics.  VT was below the detection rate of the ICD, easily
   paced out but recurrent until patient was started on Lido/Amio gtts.
   Currently paced at rate of 75.  Of note, patient has history of
   difficult to control VT - he had previously been treated with
   amiodarone however this interfered with the detection by the
   pacemaker.  For this reason he was started on mexilitine and sotalol
   previously.
   - Continue lidocaine, amiodarone gtts for now.  Will defer to EP
   regarding future anti-arrhythmic therapy.   EP may want to test device
   in the future.
   - Levophed to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will not cycle cardiac enzymes as patient is not willing to undergo
   catheterization if positive.  This has been discussed with him by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Currently intubated for airway protection, wean vent as tolerated.
   Likely keep intubated overnight.
   - No need for cooling given patient's current responsiveness.
   - Check TSH, dig level
   - Will hold sotalol, mexilitine for now.  Do not want to double up on
   medications.
   - Follow LFTs, creatinine post arrest.  High risk for acute renal
   failure.
   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU setting.
   .
   # s/p intubation: For airway protection but no evidence of respiratory
   failure.  Last ABG was 7.43/48/200.  CXR shows ET tube 3.1 cm above
   carina.
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexidine
   - Consider extubation in AM.  SBT today.
   .
   # CAD: Patient has known 2vd and is s/p CABG [**2133**].  He reported CP at
   rest prior to this admission, CP free this admission with negative
   biomarkers.  Myocardial viability study revealed some viability defect
   within the inferior wall defect - minimal.  Patient refused
   valvulplasty and angioplasy.  Biomarkers elevated but unlikely to
   change management since pt has refused cath and interventions. Will
   trend
   - continue aspirin/statin.  Holding beta blocker as above.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - trend biomarkers
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Had resolved prior to transfer to CCU.
   History appears similar to prior episode in [**1-20**].  Symptoms and labs
   felt to be c/w pancreatitis.  No cholethiasis apprecaited on abdominal
   u/s.  C. diff negative x1.

   of LV c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.
   After discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during today's code

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a previous ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest. He presented with pancreatitis and was admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to an unclear precipitant of VT arrest. The patient is currently intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation, and being treated with lidocaine and amiodarone for VT. He has a history of difficult-to-control VT and has previously been on mexilitine and sotalol, which interfered with the detection by the pacemaker.

Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia Arrest: The patient experienced a VT arrest this morning, which was successfully paced out but recurrent until the patient was started on lidocaine and amiodarone. The cause of the VT arrest is unclear, but it is more clinically consistent with scar-mediated VT rather than an ischemic event.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion during the code. Renal function should be closely monitored, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, and repeat platelet counts are needed.

4. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with"

   [**2141-3-14**] TTE: The left ventricular cavity is dilated. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
   to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Focused views. Severe left
   ventricular sysolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-3-9**], this is a
   limited/emergent/focused study and direct comparison cannot be made.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV
   ICD implanation, CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b
   VT arrest this AM.
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: This AM with unclear precipitant.  He had been feeling
   well without chest pain or shortness of breath.  Unlikely ischemic
   event and clinically more consistent with scar.  Electrolytes were
   within normal limits and patient had not missed any of his
   anti-arrhythmics.  VT was below the detection rate of the ICD, easily
   paced out but recurrent until patient was started on Lido/Amio gtts.
   Currently paced at rate of 75.  Of note, patient has history of
   difficult to control VT - he had previously been treated with
   amiodarone however this interfered with the detection by the
   pacemaker.  For this reason he was started on mexilitine and sotalol
   previously.
   - Continue lidocaine, amiodarone gtts for now.  Will defer to EP
   regarding future anti-arrhythmic therapy.   EP may want to test device
   in the future.
   - Levophed to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will not cycle cardiac enzymes as patient is not willing to undergo
   catheterization if positive.  This has been discussed with him by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Currently intubated for airway protection, wean vent as tolerated.
   Likely keep intubated overnight.
   - No need for cooling given patient's current responsiveness.
   - Check TSH, dig level
   - Will hold sotalol, mexilitine for now.  Do not want to double up on
   medications.
   - Follow LFTs, creatinine post arrest.  High risk for acute renal
   failure.
   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU setting.
   .
   # s/p intubation: For airway protection but no evidence of respiratory
   failure.  Last ABG was 7.43/48/200.  CXR shows ET tube 3.1 cm above
   carina.
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexidine
   - Consider extubation in AM.  SBT today.
   .
   # CAD: Patient has known 2vd and is s/p CABG [**2133**].  He reported CP at
   rest prior to this admission, CP free this admission with negative
   biomarkers.  Myocardial viability study revealed some viability defect
   within the inferior wall defect - minimal.  Patient refused
   valvulplasty and angioplasy.  Biomarkers elevated but unlikely to
   change management since pt has refused cath and interventions. Will
   trend
   - continue aspirin/statin.  Holding beta blocker as above.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - trend biomarkers
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Had resolved prior to transfer to CCU.
   History appears similar to prior episode in [**1-20**].  Symptoms and labs
   felt to be c/w pancreatitis.  No cholethiasis apprecaited on abdominal
   u/s.  C. diff negative x1.
   - OG tube in place
   - Continue PPI, sucralfate, antiemetics per home regimen
   .
   # Pump: Chronic systolic CHF.  The patient has known severe HK and AK
   of LV c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.
   After discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during today's code
   showed worsened LV function.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - Consider diuresis today if poor UOP.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and was found to have a ventricular tachycardia (VT) episode. He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and was successfully resuscitated. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient's vital signs were unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. He required continuous cardiac monitoring due to recurrent VT episodes. The patient was started on amiodarone and lidocaine for rhythm control, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was inserted.

The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and low urine output. He also has elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's glucose levels have been within normal limits.

The patient's pain management has been challenging, and he has been receiving morphine for substantial chest wall pain. His respiratory status has improved, with decreased oxygen requirements and adequate ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's recurrent VT episodes pose a significant risk of hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest. Close monitoring and appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy are necessary to prevent further episodes.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels"

The patient experienced a VT arrest this morning and received four shocks overnight. Amiodarone and mexiletine were restarted. The patient's current medications include aspirin, statin, amiodarone through a gastrointestinal (GI) tube, and mexiletine.

The patient is also experiencing chest pain, likely related to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and ICD shocks. His abdominal pain and diarrhea resolved prior to transfer to the critical care unit (CCU), but he had a similar episode in the past with similar symptoms and labs consistent with pancreatitis. There was no cholelithiasis appreciated on abdominal ultrasound, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) was negative once.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He also has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, a scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient was admitted with acute pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest this morning. Despite being on amiodarone and mexiletine, the patient had recurrent VT and received four shocks overnight. He is currently on amiodarone and mexiletine. There is a discussion planned with the electrophysiology (EP) service regarding further management, including the possibility of VT ablation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VT: The patient has had multiple episodes of VT despite being on maximal medical therapy. This puts him at risk for future episodes, which could lead to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's known severe aortic stenosis (AS) and low EF indicate chronic systolic heart failure. This condition may worsen over time, leading to decreased cardiac output and symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue.
3. Acute kidney injury ("

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate ranging from 75 to 136 beats per minute, blood pressure between 110/79 mmHg and 154/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and an AV-paced heart rhythm. The patient has received amiodarone and lidocaine for his VT episodes. 

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolytes are within normal range, with magnesium levels above 2.0 and potassium levels above 4.5. 

The patient's assessment and plan include various conditions:

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation.
- He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest this morning.
- The patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation.
- He is currently intubated and on minimal settings.
- The patient has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), severe aortic stenosis (AS), and acute on chronic renal failure.
- His ejection fraction (EF) is approximately 20%.
- He has a history of scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after a previous biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.
- The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- He experienced abdominal pain and diarrhea, which were resolved prior to transfer to the critical care unit (CCU).
- The patient has a history of anxiety.
- He is currently receiving multiple medications, including amiodarone, lidocaine, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and hydromorphone.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of VT and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, there is a risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised due to chronic kidney disease and recent hypoperfusion during the code. AKI may further impair renal function and require adjustment of medications and fluid management.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of abdominal pain and diarrhea raises concern for gastrointestinal bleeding, especially considering his use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin.
4. Respiratory infections: Intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory infections.
5. Cardiac tamponade: Given the patient's severe AS and recent CPR, there is a possibility of cardiac tamponade, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history. However, it is important to note that"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%. The patient also has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and has undergone implantation of a biventricular (biV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He is currently admitted with acute pancreatitis and has experienced multiple episodes of VT, requiring defibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 75 to 136 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/79 to 154/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals mild diaphoresis, no jugular venous distention (JVD), a regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, and a systolic murmur at the apex. The chest wall is described as very tense, and there is wheezing bilaterally with coarse breath sounds throughout. The abdomen is soft with mild periumbilical tenderness without rebound or guarding. Distal lower extremities are cool, and there is no ed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest, requiring defibrillation. The patient had runs of VT overnight, but no shocks were delivered. He also had a wide complex tachycardia (WCT) with stable blood pressure but presented with symptoms of lightheadedness and diaphoresis. The patient received a bolus of amiodarone and then started on a drip. He also received a bolus of lidocaine. Currently, the patient is loaded with 5.3g of amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has a history of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous episodes of VT. The recent episode of VT arrest and recurrent sustained VT indicate a high risk for future ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient may have developed ATN due to hypoperfusion during the code. This is suggested by the worsening renal function and the presence of acute on chronic renal failure.
3. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has known severe heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. His LV function worsened during today's code.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (afib). The patient was admitted with acute pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. He continues to have recurrent runs of VT and requires continuous monitoring.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including intubation and extubation, placement of an arterial line, and insertion of a nasogastric (NG) tube. He has been started on amiodarone, lidocaine, and other medications for his cardiac condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/79 mmHg to 91/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. His temperature is slightly elevated at 37.2°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing bilaterally and coarse bronchial sounds throughout. His abdomen"

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) post-biV ICD implantation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest in the unit. He sustained runs of VT overnight, but no shocks were delivered. The patient is currently being held at 130s with wide complex tachycardia (WCT) and is diaphoretic. He received a bolus of amiodarone and started on a drip. Lidocaine was also given as a bolus. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to hypoperfusion during the code. Other medical issues include abdominal pain/diarrhea (possibly related to pancreatitis), thrombocytopenia, anxiety, and feeding intolerance. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, mexiletine, aspirin, statin, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), sucralfate, antiemetics, and diuretics. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after bilateral ventricular (biV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (afib). He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest: The patient had a VT arrest this morning. There is a potential for recurrent VT or other arrhythmias due to his underlying cardiac conditions.
2. Chronic systolic heart failure (CHF): The patient has known severe aortic stenosis (AS) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) secondary to coronary artery disease, with an EF of 20%. This indicates significant impairment in the pumping function of the heart. Worsening LV function was noted during today's code.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute on chronic renal failure (ATN): The patient likely experienced ATN during the VT arrest due to hypoperfusion. There is a potential for worsening renal function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient also has a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and was admitted with pancreatitis. He experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest this morning.

Assessment and Plan:
1. VT arrest: The patient will be weaned off lidocaine (lido) and may restart mexiletine. TSH levels are within normal range, and further discussion with the electrophysiology (EP) service will be done.
2. Intubation: The aim is to extubate the patient today on minimal settings.
3. CAD: The patient's current chest pain is likely related to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks. He will continue taking aspirin and a statin. Beta-blockers will be cautiously used if chest pain recurs, considering his severe aortic stenosis (AS). Telemetry monitoring and trending biomarkers will be continued.
4. Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: The patient had resolved symptoms prior to transfer to the critical care unit (CCU). His symptoms and labs were consistent with pancreatitis. No cholelithiasis was appreciated on abdominal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and previous CABG and PCI procedures. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest requiring defibrillation. The patient has ongoing runs of VT, and his threshold was changed yesterday afternoon. He received two shocks overnight and continues to have runs of VT at a rate of 130s. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he is experiencing symptoms of lightheadedness and diaphoresis. He is currently receiving amiodarone 400mg PO TID and lidocaine gtt.

The patient also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% due to CAD. He has known severe aortic stenosis (AS) with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm as shown on most recent echocardiogram. After discussion with Dr. [First Name (STitle) **], the echocardiogram during today's code showed worsened LV function.

The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea have resolved prior to transfer to the CCU. He had a history of similar symptoms in [**1-20**], which were consistent with pancreatitis. No cholethiasis was appreciated on abdominal ultrasound. C. difficile was negative once.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV
   ICD implanation, CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b
   VT arrest and recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: Continues have runs of VT, received 2 shocks last
   evening for recurrent VT at 120ms. BP stable but pt with symptoms of
   lightheadedness and diaphoreses. Lidocaine gtt restarted. Currently
   about 6.5g loaded of amiodarone. Yesterday BiV pacing turned off for
   concern of pro-arrhythmia potential and ATP threshold was lowered to
   125.
   - continue to keep Mag>2.0, K>4.5
   - continue Amiodarone 400mg PO TID
   - continue lidocaine gtt
   - appreciate EP recs, consider VT ablation given refractory arrhythmia
   and frequent ICD firing

   sounds
   -continued to monitor CXR
   -continue ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   - restart lasix with goal 500cc-1L negative
   .
   # CAD: - current chest pain is focal and likely related to CPR and
   shocks.
   - continue aspirin/statin.  Holding beta blocker as above.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continued dilaudid 1-2mg IV q3prn

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV
   ICD implanation, CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b
   VT arrest and recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: Continues have runs of VT, received 2 shocks last
   evening for recurrent VT at 120ms. BP stable but pt with symptoms of
   lightheadedness and diaphoreses. Lidocaine gtt restarted. Currently
   about 6.5g loaded of amiodarone. Yesterday BiV pacing turned off for
   concern of pro-arrhythmia potential and ATP threshold was lowered to
   125.
   - continue to keep Mag>2.0, K>4.5
   - continue Amiodarone 400mg PO TID
   - continue lidocaine gtt
   - appreciate EP recs, consider VT ablation given refractory arrhythmia
   and frequent ICD firing
   # s/p intubation: extubated with some residual upper airway breath
   sounds
   -continued to monitor CXR
   -continue ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   - restart lasix with goal 500cc-1L negative
   .
   # CAD: - current chest pain is focal and likely related to CPR and
   shocks.
   - continue aspirin/statin.  Holding beta blocker as above.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continued dilaudid 1-2mg IV q3prn
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Had resolved prior to transfer to CCU.
   History appears similar to prior episode in [**1-20**].  Symptoms and labs
   felt to be c/w pancreatitis.  No cholethiasis apprecaited on abdominal
   u/s.  C. diff negative x1.
   - Continue PPI, sucralfate, antiemetics per home regimen
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF.  The patient has known severe HK and AK of LV
   c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.  After
   discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during today's code showed
   worsened LV function.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - Continue lasix with goal 1L negative
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likley [**2-13**] ATN, hypoperfusion during
   code
   - continue to follow
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   #Thrombocytopenia: continue to follow
   .
   # Anxiety: lots of anxiety related to shocks and alarming tele
   -continue clonopin 1mg TID PRN
   -continue ativan 1mg qhs

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) post biventricular (BiV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest requiring defibrillation.

The patient continues to have runs of VT, despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine. His blood pressure is stable, but he is experiencing symptoms of lightheadedness and diaphoresis. The BiV pacing has been turned off due to concerns of proarrhythmia potential, and the ATP threshold has been lowered to 125.

The patient's recent labs show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), troponin T, lactate, and lactic acid. His electrolyte levels are relatively stable, with a magnesium level above 2.0 and potassium level above 4.5.

The patient's plan includes continuing amiodarone 400mg orally three times a day, restarting lidocaine gtt, monitoring for VT ablation given the refractory arrhythmia and frequent ICD firing, and considering VT ablation due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU for cardiac arrest and ventricular tachycardia. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and acute renal failure. He also has acute pancreatitis and pain control issues. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/55 to 138/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including lidocaine, heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and lorazepam (Ativan). The patient's labs show elevated levels of creatinine and lactic acid, with decreased levels of hemoglobin and potassium. The patient's WBC count is within normal range, while platelet count is slightly low. Imaging studies and physical examination findings are not available in the provided information.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible acute renal failure, which can further complicate his existing chronic kidney disease.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease may worsen due to the current acute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He was admitted with pancreatitis and had an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest, requiring defibrillation. The patient experienced recurrent runs of VT, but no shocks were delivered overnight. He was given amiodarone and lidocaine, and his magnesium level was kept above 2.0. The patient continues to have episodes of VT, and his blood pressure remains stable, although he experiences symptoms of lightheadedness and diaphoresis. He was extubated but has residual upper airway breath sounds. The patient's condition is being monitored closely, and he is receiving appropriate medications and treatments for his various medical issues. Potential medical complications that can arise include recurrent VT, worsening heart function, acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD)."

He also has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient has a history of scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) and has undergone biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest, followed by recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%. The patient also has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and has undergone implantation of a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Additionally, he has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (afib).

The patient was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest, which required defibrillation. He continues to have runs of VT, and his ICD threshold was changed yesterday afternoon. The patient received two shocks overnight and is currently being treated with amiodarone and lidocaine.

The patient was intubated but has since been extubated with some residual upper airway breath sounds. He is on ipratropium and albuterol nebs, and his chest pain is focal and likely related to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks. The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea have resolved, and his chronic systolic CHF is being managed with aspirin and statin therapy. His acute"

   Ongoing ventricular tachycardia; we are planning on performing cor
   angio tomorrow with hope of improving perfusion of peri-infarct zone
   (prior extensive inferior posterior infarct, which is likely the
   substrate of the tachycardia); my rationale is that peri-infarct
   ischemia may be the trigger for the tachycardia.  Would avoid excessive
   volume unloading prior to cath.  Pt should remain moderately sedated
   due to shocks.  We should have a low threshold for intubation.
   Then Tuesday possible catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia
   (depends on cor angio result).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient presented with pancreatitis and was admitted to the ICU. He experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest and required defibrillation. Despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine, he continues to have runs of VT. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has symptoms of lightheadedness and diaphoresis. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced multiple episodes of VT, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. The current treatment plan includes continuing lidocaine and amiodarone, lowering the threshold for detecting VT, and considering a change to intravenous amiodarone due to persistent VT.
2. Cardiac Catheterization and Ablation: The patient is scheduled for cardiac catheterization on Monday and may undergo ventricular tachycardia ablation on Tuesday. This procedure aims to improve perfusion and potentially reduce the occurrence of VT.
3. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has known severe heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. This"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He also has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%. The patient was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest, requiring defibrillation. Despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine, the patient continues to have runs of VT. 

The patient has been intubated and extubated, with some residual upper airway breath sounds. He is receiving inhaled bronchodilators and diuretics. The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea, which were initially present, have resolved. 

The patient has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and a history of hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease. After discussion with Dr. [First Name (Title)], the echocardiogram during the code showed worsened left ventricular function. 

The patient is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, likely related to hypoperfusion during the code. There is no evidence of thrombocytopenia. 

The patient is anxious and experiencing symptoms of PTSD related to the repeated shocks. 

The plan is to continue with the current medications, including amiodarone and lidocaine"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, a previous episode of scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT), and atrial fibrillation (afib). The patient was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced two episodes of VT, both of which were successfully defibrillated. He remains on amiodarone and lidocaine infusions, but continues to have runs of VT.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Recurrent VT: The patient's persistent VT despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine infusions indicates a high risk for recurrent episodes, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.

2. Cardiac catheterization: The plan for cardiac catheterization, including both left and right heart catheterization, suggests a possible need for further evaluation and intervention to assess the severity of coronary artery disease and determine appropriate management strategies.

3. VT ablation: Considering the patient's history of scar-mediated VT and ongoing episodes, VT ablation may be considered as a potential treatment option to help control and prevent recurrent VT episodes.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's recent episode of hypoperfusion during"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and acute renal failure. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease (CKD) and pancreatitis. On admission, the patient was started on lasix for diuresis and lidocaine for VT. The patient experienced two episodes of VT, both successfully shocked. Lorazepam was given for sedation. Poor peripheral IV access was noted. The patient received various infusions and medications, including hydromorphone, pantoprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced multiple episodes of VT, which is a potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's history of CKD puts him at risk for complications related to chronic kidney disease, such as anemia, bone disease, and cardiovascular problems.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's medical history includes acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, necrosis"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention, severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia secondary to a previous biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest requiring defibrillation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- He has had runs of VT and received two shocks overnight.
- He is currently on amiodarone 400mg orally three times a day and lidocaine via a continuous infusion.
- His magnesium level should be maintained above 2.0, and his potassium level should be kept above 4.5.
- He is also being monitored for any signs of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF).
- His chest pain is likely related to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the shocks he received.
- He is currently on aspirin and a statin medication, but his beta-blocker has been held.
- His abdominal pain and diarrhea have resolved, but he will continue to receive medications for his gastrointestinal symptoms.
- His chronic systolic heart failure is expected to worsen due to his known severe aortic stenosis and reduced left ventricular function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) arrest requiring defibrillation. The patient remains on amiodarone and lidocaine infusions due to persistent VT.

The patient has a history of cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for scar-mediated VT. He also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute on chronic renal failure likely secondary to recent hypoperfusion during the code. The patient's ejection fraction is approximately 20%.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/73 mmHg to 124/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is intubated but extubated with residual upper airway breath sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, and elevated troponin T levels. Other labs are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual in the ICU with ongoing medical complications. They have been NPO since cath insertion in the morning and are being treated for a heart rate of 111 bpm with lorazepam and hydromorphone. Lasix is being administered through a gtt to maintain fluid balance, and amiodarone is also being given at a rate of 0.5mg/min. The patient has no known drug allergies. Infusions include lidocaine at 2 mg/min and heparin sodium as prophylaxis. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole, lorazepam, and hydromorphone. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the addition of sustained ventricular tachycardia. Flowsheet data shows fluctuations in vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient's ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to assessment not being performed. Lab results indicate abnormalities in hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, troponin-T, and various other lab parameters. Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, pain control, acute renal failure, cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia, chronic renal failure, acute pancreatitis, among others. ICU care involves nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI, severe ischemic
   cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV ICD implantation,
   CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b VT arrest and
   recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation.  Remains on amio and
   lidocaine gtt with persistent VT overnight.
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: Continues to have runs of VT.  Had VT overnight with
   shocks x 7. Rate of VT increased from prior, 230s. Both episodes with
   slight decrease in VT but shocked quickly . On lidocaine gtt and
   Amiodarone gtt. Received lido bolus 50mg x 1 overnight for recurrent
   VT. Due to excesss sedation for anxiety related to shocks and need for
   intubation this am for EP study, pt was electively intubated overnight
   for airway protection. There was concern that he was somnolent and
   gurgling respiratory secretions. Had cath yesterday with no obvious
   ischemic cause to suggest etiology of VT that could be intervened upon.
   - continue to keep Mag>2.0, K>4.5
   - Holding Lido and amio for EP study this am (has also completed amio
   load)
   - f/u EP recs after procedure regarding meds, ICD settings
   - VT ablation today with EP study.
   - Pt with element of PTSD due to persistent shocks.  Treat anxiety with
   ativan PRN, sedation as needed while intubated.
   # s/p intubation: Intubated for airway protection in setting of high
   dose sedatives required for anri-anxiety
   -          Extubate when stable, possibly after EP study, VT ablation
   -          Maintain on minimal vent settings with daily SBT
   .
   # CAD: Current chest pain is focal with chest wall tenderness and
   ecchymosesand likely related to CPR and shocks.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - continued fentanyl/versed prn
   .
   # Constipation: Pt has not been on bowel regimen due to initial
   presentation with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Now has been on
   narcotics with no BM in several days to a week. Abdomen distended on
   exam.
   -          Continue PPI, sucralfate, antiemetics per home regimen
   -          Added bowel regimen (colace, senna, bisacodyl); titrate as
   needed to BM
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF.  The patient has known severe HK and AK of LV
   c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.  After
   discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during code showed worsened
   LV function. Cath without focal cause of ischemia/VT.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - Had been on lasix gtt but will hold today due to lower BPs since
   intubation and increased sedation
   .
   # Fever: Pt had low grade fever [**2141-3-20**] 100.7. Thick brown sputum
   suctioned from ETT. Sputum cx with 2+ GPC. Blood and urine cx NGTD
   -          Follow up cx data
   -          consider start vanc/zosyn if spikes for HAP if looks
   infected with elevated WBC or persistent fevers
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likley [**2-13**] ATN, hypoperfusion during
   code. Stable at Cr 1.9-2.
   - continue to follow
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   #Thrombocytopenia: continue to follow
   .
   # Anxiety: lots of anxiety related to shocks and alarming tele. Has
   been intubated and sedated now.
   -continue clonopin 1mg TID PRN
   -continue ativan 1mg qhs
   - continue fentanyl/versed prn
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet
   - Follow lytes and replete aggressively.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin subq, bowel regimen, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and subsequently experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest requiring defibrillation. The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization without finding any focal ischemic cause for the VT, and an electrophysiological (EP) study and ablation are planned today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has had multiple episodes of VT, which required defibrillation. It is important to monitor for recurrent episodes of VT and adjust antiarrhythmic medication as per the recommendations from the EP study.
2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF ~20%) indicate compromised cardiac function. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and cardiac enzymes is necessary to assess any further deterioration.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to hypoperfusion during resuscitation. It is crucial to maintain adequate renal perfusion, avoid nephrotoxic agents, and monitor serum creatinine levels closely.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and it needs to be monitored regularly. If the platelet count continues to decrease"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have no obstructive disease to suggest the etiology of VT. Blood cultures were taken due to suspected infection, and the patient was intubated overnight due to somnolence and concern for airway protection. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including renal failure, acute and chronic, pain control, sustained ventricular tachycardia, pancreatitis, and possible nutrition alteration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) - VT is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can lead to cardiac arrest if not managed promptly.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF) - ARF is characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for dialysis.
3. Chronic renal failure (CRF) - CRF is a long-term condition where the kidneys gradually lose their function over time. It may require ongoing management and can lead to complications such as anemia, bone disease, and cardiovascular problems.
4. Pancreatitis - Acute pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas that can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and organ dysfunction. It can lead to complications such as infection, organ failure, and malnutrition.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI, severe ischemic
   cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV ICD implanation,
   CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b VT arrest and
   recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation.  Remains on amio and
   lidocaine gtt with persistent VT.
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: Continues have runs of VT.  Threshold was lowered this
   admission to detect VT at rate of 120-130s.  2 shocks delivered
   overnight.  Both episodes with BP stable but pt with symptoms of
   lightheadedness and diaphoreses.  On lidocaine gtt, PO amiodarone.
   - continue to keep Mag>2.0, K>4.5
   - Consider change to IV amiodarone given persistent VT and concern for
   poor absorption.
   - continue Lidocaine gtt for now.
   - appreciate EP recs.  Continue to follow with them.
   - Plan for cardiac catheterization on Monday
 both left and right
   heart cath.  Likely VT ablation on Tuesday.
   - Pt with element of PTSD due to persistent shocks.  Treat anxiety with
   ativan PRN.
   # s/p intubation: extubated with some residual upper airway breath
   sounds
   -continue ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   - continue with diuresis.  Put out well yesterday.
   .
   # CAD: - current chest pain is focal and likely related to CPR and
   shocks.
   - continue aspirin/statin.  Holding beta blocker as above.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continued dilaudid 1-2mg IV q3prn
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Had resolved prior to transfer to CCU.
   History appears similar to prior episode in [**1-20**].  Symptoms and labs
   felt to be c/w pancreatitis.  No cholethiasis apprecaited on abdominal
   u/s.  C. diff negative x1.
   - Continue PPI, sucralfate, antiemetics per home regimen
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF.  The patient has known severe HK and AK of LV
   c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.  After
   discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during code showed worsened
   LV function.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - Continue diuresis if poor UOP though this may be post-arrest ATN
   UOP 45cc/hr currently
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likley [**2-13**] ATN, hypoperfusion during

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He also has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20% and a scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) following the implantation of a biventricular (biV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest, which required defibrillation. He continues to have runs of VT despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (afib). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requires invasive ventilation due to his condition. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to an ischemic event during the code. He also has thrombocytopenia and anxiety related to the shocks and alarming telemetry.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 60 to 268 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 67 to 141 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 7 to 24"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI, severe ischemic
   cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV ICD implantation,
   CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b VT arrest and
   recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation.  Remains on amio and
   lidocaine gtt with persistent VT overnight.
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: EP study yesterday with ablation.  However, still has
   Vtach.
   - EP follow up today
   - continue to keep Mag>2.0, K>4.5
   - continue lidocaine and Amiodarone
   - started mexilitine
   - Pt with element of PTSD due to persistent shocks.  Treat anxiety with
   ativan PRN, sedation as needed while intubated.
   # Fever.  Probably PNA.
   -          Vanc/Zopsyn for VAP empirically
   -          Blood and urine cultures
   # s/p intubation: Intubated for airway protection in setting of high
   dose sedatives required for anri-anxiety
   -          Extubate when stable, possibly after EP study, VT ablation
   -          Maintain on minimal vent settings with daily SBT
   .
   # CAD: Current chest pain is focal with chest wall tenderness and
   ecchymosesand likely related to CPR and shocks.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - continued fentanyl/versed prn
   .
   # Constipation: Pt has not been on bowel regimen due to initial
   presentation with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Now has been on
   narcotics with no BM in several days to a week. Abdomen distended on
   exam.
   -          Continue PPI, sucralfate, antiemetics per home regimen
   -          Added bowel regimen (colace, senna, bisacodyl); titrate as
   needed to BM
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF.  The patient has known severe HK and AK of LV
   c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.  After
   discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during code showed worsened
   LV function. Cath without focal cause of ischemia/VT.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - Had been on lasix gtt but will hold due to lower BPs since intubation
   and increased sedation
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likley [**2-13**] ATN, hypoperfusion during
   code. Stable at Cr 1.9-2.
   - continue to follow
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   #Thrombocytopenia: continue to follow
   .
   # Anxiety: lots of anxiety related to shocks and alarming tele. Has
   been intubated and sedated now.
   -continue clonopin 1mg TID PRN
   -continue ativan 1mg qhs
   - continue fentanyl/versed prn
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet
   - Follow lytes and replete aggressively.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin subq, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # CODE: Full code for procedure today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient also has a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and has experienced recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that required defibrillation. 

The patient's current condition includes pancreatitis, chronic systolic heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. He is currently intubated due to airway protection and is sedated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT and the presence of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy increase the risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. It is important to continue with anti-arrhythmic medications such as amiodarone and lidocaine, and start mexiletine as recommended by the EP study.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever, which could indicate an infection such as pneumonia. Empirical antibiotics have been started, and further investigations like blood and urine cultures are planned.

3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion during resuscitation. It is essential to continue monitoring kidney function and avoiding nephrotox"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI, severe ischemic
   cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV ICD implantation,
   CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b VT arrest and
   recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation.  Remains on amio and
   lidocaine gtt with persistent VT overnight.
   .
   # s/p VT arrest: Continues to have runs of VT.  Had VT overnight with
   shocks x 7. Rate of VT increased from prior, 230s. Both episodes with
   slight decrease in VT but shocked quickly . On lidocaine gtt and
   Amiodarone gtt. Received lido bolus 50mg x 1 overnight for recurrent
   VT. Due to excesss sedation for anxiety related to shocks and need for
   intubation this am for EP study, pt was electively intubated overnight
   for airway protection. There was concern that he was somnolent and
   gurgling respiratory secretions. Had cath yesterday with no obvious
   ischemic cause to suggest etiology of VT that could be intervened upon.
   - continue to keep Mag>2.0, K>4.5
   - Holding Lido and amio for EP study this am (has also completed amio
   load)
   - f/u EP recs after procedure regarding meds, ICD settings
   - VT ablation today with EP study.
   - Pt with element of PTSD due to persistent shocks.  Treat anxiety with
   ativan PRN, sedation as needed while intubated.
   # s/p intubation: Intubated for airway protection in setting of high
   dose sedatives required for anri-anxiety
   -          Extubate when stable, possibly after EP study, VT ablation
   -          Maintain on minimal vent settings with daily SBT
   .
   # CAD: Current chest pain is focal with chest wall tenderness and
   ecchymosesand likely related to CPR and shocks.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - continued fentanyl/versed prn
   .
   # Constipation: Pt has not been on bowel regimen due to initial
   presentation with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Now has been on
   narcotics with no BM in several days to a week. Abdomen distended on
   exam.
   -          Continue PPI, sucralfate, antiemetics per home regimen
   -          Added bowel regimen (colace, senna, bisacodyl); titrate as
   needed to BM
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF.  The patient has known severe HK and AK of LV
   c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.  After
   discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during code showed worsened
   LV function. Cath without focal cause of ischemia/VT.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - Had been on lasix gtt but will hold today due to lower BPs since
   intubation and increased sedation
   .
   # Fever: Pt had low grade fever [**2141-3-20**] 100.7. Thick brown sputum
   suctioned from ETT. Sputum cx with 2+ GPC. Blood and urine cx NGTD
   -          Follow up cx data
   -          consider start vanc/zosyn if spikes for HAP if looks
   infected with elevated WBC or persistent fevers
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likley [**2-13**] ATN, hypoperfusion during
   code. Stable at Cr 1.9-2.
   - continue to follow
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   #Thrombocytopenia: continue to follow
   .
   # Anxiety: lots of anxiety related to shocks and alarming tele. Has
   been intubated and sedated now.
   -continue clonopin 1mg TID PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) status post biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation admitted with pancreatitis. The patient experienced a VT arrest and required defibrillation. He underwent an electrophysiology (EP) study with ablation but still has recurrent VT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of scar-mediated VT and continues to experience recurrent VT despite the EP study and ablation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient was admitted with pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as necrosis, pseudocysts, or systemic inflammation.
3. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with a low EF, indicating compromised cardiac function. This increases the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has CKD, which may worsen due to factors such as hypoperfusion during resuscitation, nephrotoxic medications, or inadequate renal dosing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest, requiring defibrillation. The patient underwent an electrophysiological (EP) study and ablation but still has recurrent sustained VT. He remains on amiodarone, lidocaine, and mexiletine.

The patient's current condition includes fever, possibly due to pneumonia, for which he has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anxiety, and constipation. The patient is intubated and sedated, with plans for weaning off the ventilator after the upcoming EP study. His blood cultures and sputum culture have been sent.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with no known drug allergies. They have been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0°F, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/57 mmHg to 125/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently ventricular-paced. 

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications. They have been febrile with temperatures spiking to 102.0°F. There have been six episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were paced out without any shocks. The patient's blood cultures were taken on 03/22/2141 at 10:30 AM and sputum culture was taken at 11:00 AM. 

The patient's medications include vasopressin at 2.4 units per hour, phenylephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. They have also been given spironolactone to maintain elevated potassium levels and switched from neo to vasopressin to wean off. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever. 

Flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 2,965 mL of fluids since"

The patient is a 71-inch male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been experiencing episodes of ventricular tachycardia but has been paced out and received no shocks. The patient's temperature has been spiking to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has been started on spironolactone to maintain elevated potassium levels, and vasopressin has been initiated to wean off neo. The patient is currently on ventilatory support with a respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure at 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's blood pressure is low, with readings ranging from 82/57 mmHg to 125/80 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits but is predominantly paced. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 95%. 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the discontinuation of amio, lido, and mexilitene due to ventricular morphology changes and potential proarrhythmic effects. The patient's medications also include vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), vasopressin, phenylephrine, heparin sodium, and others. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis and subsequently experienced a VT arrest requiring defibrillation. The patient underwent electrophysiological study (EPS) and ablation of two circuits two days prior. He is currently intubated for airway protection due to the need for high-dose sedatives for anxiolysis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 82/57 mmHg to 125/80 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 80 to 101 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16-21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen, and he is paced at a rate of 550 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of scar-mediated VT and experienced recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation. There is a potential risk of further VT episodes.
2. Infection: The patient has fever and is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) post-biV ICD implantation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (afib). He was admitted with acute pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest requiring defibrillation. He underwent an electrophysiological study (EPS) two days prior, with ablation of two circuits. 

The patient has been on amiodarone and lidocaine, but these medications were stopped due to concerns about their potential arrhythmogenic effects. Instead, he was started on mexiletine, a sodium channel blocker. His potassium levels need to be maintained above 4.5, and magnesium levels above 2.0.

The patient is also showing signs of fever, likely due to pneumonia (PNA) given the thick sputum from the endotracheal tube (ETT). Blood, sputum, and urine cultures have been ordered to identify the source of infection. If the fever persists, the PICC line may be discontinued, and central access may be required for pressors if still needed.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to sedation."

","The patient's chief complaint is not provided in the given progress note. The note indicates that blood cultures were taken from the patient's PICC line and right forearm, and the sputum cultures were positive for coag positive staph. The patient is currently experiencing fever, which is trending down since the morning. 

The patient is unable to be weaned off the ventilator and is still on neo and dopa. The healthcare team is attempting to wean sedation for possible extubation but has started mexilitene and will ideally add a beta blocker once the patient is off pressors. Reglan has been added, and total parenteral nutrition (TFs) were planned but not initiated due to the possibility of extubation.

The patient's allergies are not mentioned. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient is receiving multiple infusions including vasopressin, phenylephrine, and propofol. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged from admission.

The review of systems is unchanged except as noted below. The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit) and current temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit). The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, blood pressure is slightly low, respiratory rate is slightly elevated,"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG and PCI, severe ischemic
   cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%, scar mediated VT s/p biV ICD implantation,
   CKD, and afib admitted with pancreatitis, course c/b VT arrest and
   recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation.  Remains on amio and
   lidocaine gtt with persistent VT overnight.
   .
   # VT, s/p VT arrest: EP study 2 days prior with ablation of 2 circuits.
   Stopped AMio, lido gtt and mexilitene because of concern that these
   were arryhthmogenic. Had VT x 6 episodes which he paced himself out of.
   Spironolactone started to maintain K>4.5.
   - F/U EP recs
   - continue to keep Mag>2.0, K>4.5
   - started mexilitine PO while holding amio and lido
   .
   # Fever.  Probably PNA given thick sputum from ETT. Sputum cx pending
   with gram stain showing GPCs in prs and clusters. Still spiking fevers
   on Vanc/Zosyn. Other possible etiologies of infection include line
   infection.
   -          Vanc/Zosyn for VAP empirically
   -          Blood, sputum, and urine cultures
   -          DC PICC if still spiking later today and may need central
   access for pressors if still requiring
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely from sedation since started periintubation and
   has persisted while sedated. Other possible etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock (less likely since warm, well perfused) or sepsis
   given fevers.
   -          wean neo as tolerated
   -          continue vasopressin for now
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   -          treat infection as above
   .
   # s/p intubation: Intubated for airway protection in setting of high
   dose sedatives required for anti-anxiety
   -          Extubate when stable, hemodynamics improved
   -          Maintain on minimal vent settings with daily SBT
   .
   # CAD:
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - cautious use of SLN if CP recurs given severe AS
   - continued fentanyl/versed prn, weaning propofol
   .
   # Constipation: Pt has not been on bowel regimen due to initial
   presentation with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Now has been on
   narcotics with no BM in several days to a week. Abdomen distended on
   exam.
   -          Continue PPI, reglan
   -          Added bowel regimen (colace, senna, bisacodyl); titrate as
   needed to BM
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF.  The patient has known severe HK and AK of LV
   c/w CAD, EF 20%, AS (valve area 0.8-1.0cm) on most recent echo.  After
   discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], echocardiogram during code showed worsened
   LV function. Cath without focal cause of ischemia/VT.
   - continue aspirin/statin.
   - Had been on lasix gtt but will hold due to lower BPs since intubation
   and increased sedation; also worsens hypokalemia and trying to maintain
   K>4.5
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely [**2-13**] ATN, hypoperfusion during
   code. Steadily improving.
   - continue to follow
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   #Thrombocytopenia: continue to follow
   .
   # Anxiety: lots of anxiety related to shocks and alarming tele.
   Intubated and sedated now.
   -continue clonopin 1mg TID PRN
   -continue ativan 1mg qhs
   - continue fentanyl/versed prn
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet
   - Follow lytes and replete aggressively.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin subq, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # CODE: No CPR; allowed 1 shock. Extubate as possible
   .
   # DISPO: pending above

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient also has a scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after implantation of a biventricular (biV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
- The patient was admitted with acute pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest requiring defibrillation.
- An electrophysiology (EP) study was performed two days prior to the note, with successful ablation of two circuits. The patient was taken off amiodarone and lidocaine due to concerns about their potential arrhythmogenic effects.
- The patient continues to experience VT episodes, which he is pacing himself out of.
- The patient has a fever, likely due to pneumonia given the thick sputum from the endotracheal tube (ETT). Sputum cultures are pending, showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient is still spiking fevers despite being on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
- Other possible etiologies of infection include line infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted with pancreatitis. The patient experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) arrest and required defibrillation. He was started on mexilitine for VT prophylaxis and is off amiodarone. The patient has been weaned off vasopressors and is no longer hypotensive. He has MRSA pneumonia and E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), both of which are being treated with appropriate antibiotics. The patient's chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) is worsening due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and known severe left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and dysfunction (HK) caused by CAD. The patient's renal function is improving, and he has mild diarrhea. His anxiety is being managed with clonazepam. The patient is extubated and doing well. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening LV function: The patient has severe LV dysfunction due to CAD and AS, which can lead to further decompensation of CHF.
2. Recurrent VT: The patient had a previous VT arrest and requires ongoing prophylaxis with mexilitine.
3. MRSA pneumonia/VAP: The patient has MRSA pneumonia and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

1. VT, s/p VT arrest: The patient is on mexilitine, an antiarrhythmic medication, and is off amiodarone. No VT occurred overnight.
2. MRSA pneumonia: The patient still has fevers and leukocytosis, likely due to subtherapeutic vancomycin (vanc) trough levels. It is recommended to increase vanc to [Hospital1] and discontinue piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
3. E. coli UTI: The patient has an infection sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, but it will be narrowed to ceftriaxone for a 7-day course.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch individual who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has pneumonia, hypotension, anxiety, altered elimination due to diarrhea, a skull fracture, impaired skin integrity, fever, alteration in nutrition, and cardiac dysrhythmia.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/66 mmHg to 85/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and carafate.

The lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 173 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 80 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L. The WBC count has been increasing over the past few days, suggesting a possible infection or inflammatory response.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including pneumonia (hospital-acquired), hypotension, renal failure (acute and chronic), cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia, pancreatitis, and altered glycemic control. These conditions require close monitoring and management in the ICU setting.

Overall, the patient's condition appears"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 98/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is still experiencing mild hypotension. The patient's temperature is within normal range. Physical examination reveals a tachycardic rhythm and a systolic murmur. The patient has been started on lasix and is being considered for metoprolol. The patient has been eating and drinking. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of a systolic murmur may increase the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias.
2. Renal failure: The patient's recent acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease could potentially lead to further deterioration in renal function.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to worsening respiratory function and potential respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient is still at risk for developing hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (D"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and previous scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He was admitted with acute pancreatitis and experienced a VT arrest that required defibrillation. The patient also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), renal failure, anxiety, and is currently being treated for MRSA pneumonia and E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (within normal range), blood pressure of 98/66 mmHg (with some variability), respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute (within normal range), oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula, and a heart rhythm of ventricular paced rhythm. The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, a regular systolic murmur, prominent precordial heave, clear to auscultation bilaterally, soft and obese abdomen with mild distension and positive bowel sounds, and trace edema in both upper and lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.2-15.8 thousand/mm3, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.1-9.4 g/dL, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 207-292 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.1-1.7 mg/dL, elevated blood glucose (Glucose) of 78-212 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for slightly low potassium (K+) levels. Other lab values such as BUN, creatinine, total bilirubin (T Bili), lactate acid, albumin, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphorus (PO4) are also provided.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of LV function, hypotension, VT, MRSA pneumonia, E. coli UTI, chronic systolic CHF, acute on chronic renal failure, diarrhea, anxiety, and potential fluid imbalance. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac rhythm, renal function, electrolyte levels, and infection status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) post biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pancreatitis, which has since resolved. The patient experienced a VT arrest and required defibrillation. He also has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) confirmed by ultrasound. Due to his history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, anticoagulation poses a risk.

Plan:
- Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation with goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-80.
- Follow up with the primary cardiologist regarding warfarin (Coumadin) and plan for long-term anticoagulation.
- Continue sucralfate and proton pump inhibitor (PPI), maintain adequate temperature, and screen for VT.
- Increase metoprolol to 25 mg orally three times a day from 12.5 mg.
- Keep magnesium level greater than 2.0 and potassium level greater than 4.5.
- Continue mexiletine orally.
- F/u electrophysiology (EP) recommendations.
- MRSA pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Afebrile for 24 hours, leukocytosis improving now after an 8-day course of vancomycin.
- Follow-up blood cultures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) after biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for pancreatitis, which has now resolved. The patient experienced a VT arrest and recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation. He has left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) confirmed on ultrasound. The patient is at high risk for anticoagulation due to his history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anticoagulation risk: The patient's history of upper GI bleeds increases the risk of anticoagulation-related bleeding.
2. DVT: The patient has left upper extremity DVT, which may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, a low ejection fraction, and scar-mediated VT. These cardiac conditions pose a risk for further arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to further renal dysfunction.

","The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) post biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (afib). The patient was admitted with pancreatitis, which has since resolved, but experienced a VT arrest and recurrent sustained VT requiring defibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/65 mmHg to 170/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, regular systolic murmur, prominent precordial heave, clear to auscultation in the head and neck area, and trace edema in the right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.2-15.8 thousand/mm³, hematocrit of 30-31.9%, platelet count of 207-292 thousand/mm³, creatinine of 1.1-"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia. The patient has a history of recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. On admission, the patient was found to have a nearly occlusive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left upper extremity, extending from the superficial basilic and cephalic veins into the deep brachial and axillary veins. The left subclavian vein appears to be patent. The patient was started on heparin drip for the DVT.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including placement of a PICC line and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs have been within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate ranging from 80 to 114 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 77 to 170 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 8 to 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, blood glucose, ALT, AST, LDH, calcium, and phosphorus. The patient's electrolytes are slightly imbalanced, with low potassium and magnesium levels."
