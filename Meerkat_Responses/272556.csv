   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4021**] and I
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  The patient is transferred
   from [**Hospital3 2882**] for continued management of resp failure.  We still
   need to get further information from [**Hospital1 **] physicians as the degree of
COPD
 is not clear.  Right now her imaging suggests diffuse
   interstitial disease.  This, plus the hx of an echo there with PASP in
   the 70
s would suggest she has severe chronic ILD with pulm htn.  Yet
   the story also suggests the patient was very active till recently!  For
   today, we will pull back her ETT which has migrated into the right
   mainstem, and we will continue high dose steroids, likely high enough
   to treat an exacerbation of IPF.  We will continue bronchodilators,
   pending review of her LC pfts. We will also ask her family to get us a
   CD of her LC imaging.  She looks uncomfortable on PSV and we will try
   to change her to A/C and sedate her more.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as a transfer from another hospital following possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. She was started on invasive ventilation and has been receiving treatment for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure/pneumonia, hypotension, feeding through a tube, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. There is a need to further evaluate the cause of pneumonia and determine the most appropriate treatment plan.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires ongoing vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure. Close monitoring and careful titration of the vasopressor are necessary to avoid complications such as organ hypoperfusion or arrhythmias.
3. Feeding: The patient is currently receiving tube feeds, and there may be a need for a nutrition consult to optimize her nutritional support.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism should be monitored and managed appropriately with continued administration of synthroid.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may require consideration for lipid-lowering therapy once it is safe to restart oral medications.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease:"

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as a transfer from OSH following possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. She has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is currently receiving invasive ventilation, PICC line, arterial line, and other supportive measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not managed properly.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's current status on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures such as changing to an assist control mode and obtaining further sputum cultures should be taken.
3. Hypotension: The patient is currently stable on neosynephrine but unable to be weaned. There is a risk of persistent hypotension leading to inadequate tissue perfusion if not managed carefully.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk for developing other nosocomial infections due to the invasive lines and tubes in place.
6. Delirium: The patient is anxious and has been given Ativan with minimal effect. There is a risk of developing delirium due to the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and possible pneumonia. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including hypotension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, and GERD. She is currently being treated with various medications, including vancomycin, imipenem, fentanyl, midazolam, phenylephrine, pantoprazole, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which may be due to acute pneumonia or an underlying chronic condition such as COPD. The diffuse severe interstitial lung disease seen on CT chest suggests a potential complication in this area.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of G+ cocci in the sputum indicates a possible bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms, increased WBC count, and fever.
3. Hypotension: The patient is stable on 0.3 mg of phenylephrine, but careful monitoring is required to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion. Close attention should be given to urine output (UOP) as well.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels show improvement from baseline, but ongoing monitoring is necessary. Adjust"

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4321**] above
   and agree with the findings and plan of care.
   The patient is much more comfortable today on A/C ventilation and with
   more sedation.  Her chest CT shows chiefly diffuse interstitial lung
   disease, age indeterminate.  I assume, with her pulm htn on echo that
   most of this is old, but need [**Hospital1 **] imaging to better assess this.
   Meanwhile we will stop Rx for HCAP and continue high dose prednisone in
   case any of this ILD is reversible.  Her hypotension will be Rx
d with
   decrease in PEEP, mild reduction in sedation, and a IVF bolus.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and possible pneumonia. The patient was transferred from another hospital (OSH) for failure to wean from the ventilator and previous medical assessment suggesting she should be made CMO (Chief Medical Officer). The patient has been on vancomycin and imipenem for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (sputum with G+ cocci), as well as prednisone for pneumonitis or steroid-responsive illness.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/47 mmHg to 136/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature ranging from 35.6°C to 37.6°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals increased work of breathing, clear lung sounds, and no signs of cyanosis or jaundice. Neurological examination shows alertness with appropriate responses to questioning, and all four extremities move. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal kidney function.

Imaging studies show no evidence of pulmonary embolus, diffuse severe interstitial lung disease, and multiple compression deformities in the mid thoracic spine.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure/acute (not ARDS), bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hypot"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, and hypotension. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving sedatives and analgesics.

24-hour events include plans to administer Solvay 80-TID for five days, followed by a repeat CT scan and re-dosing of steroids. Vancomycin was stopped, and the patient received a bolus of normal saline for low urine output. The patient's O2 saturation levels were in the 80s this morning.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted events. The patient denies pain and shortness of breath.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/68 to 90/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance indicates an input of 2,967 mL and output of 725 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,242 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 401 mL, respiratory rate"

She has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her oxygen saturation levels are in the 80s, indicating inadequate oxygenation. The patient has been receiving bronchodilators, sedatives, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. Her vital signs are stable, but she has low urine output. The patient's hematocrit levels are low, likely due to phlebotomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to her underlying COPD or potential interstitial lung disease. Close monitoring and further evaluation, such as a bronchoscopy, are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and sputum gram stain with gram-positive cocci in pairs suggest bacterial pneumonia. The causative organism needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
3. Decreased Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit levels are low, which can be caused by phlebotomy or active bleeding. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be related to her underlying condition or medication side effects. Close monitoring of fluid balance and blood pressure is"

   We are continuing to have difficulty with oxygenation. Will increase
   PEEP to 10 to see if we can reduce FIO2 below 0.6. CT scan and report
   of echo suggests significant chronic lung disease leading to pulmonary
   hypertension. CT shows honeycombing consistent with chronic pulmonary
   fibrosis. There may be a superimposed alveolitis given the ground-glass
   appearance. I am concerned this represents an acute exacerbation of ILD

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 and FIO2 of 0.6. The patient's WBC count has dropped significantly, and they have anemia with a Hct of 21. The patient is being transfused with PRBCs. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they continue to have difficulty with oxygenation, which is being addressed by increasing the PEEP to 10. The patient's CT scan shows diffuse interstitial changes with fibrosis and superimposed ground-glass opacities, indicating chronic lung disease leading to pulmonary hypertension. There is concern for an acute exacerbation of ILD or [**Doctor Last Name 11**]-[**Doctor First Name **] syndrome. The patient has started on high-dose steroids and antibiotics. A bronch will be considered to assess for PCP and resistant bacteria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has respiratory failure, which is a serious condition that can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potentially result in death if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can worsen the respiratory failure and increase the risk of complications such as sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. COPD Exacerbation:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and hypotension. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has failed extubation trials. A bronchoscopy was performed, which showed no significant findings. The patient's blood gases indicate respiratory distress with low oxygen levels (PaO2 52%) and elevated carbon dioxide levels (pCO2 46). The patient received one unit of blood for a low hematocrit level of 21, with a post-transfusion hematocrit of 26.9. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and he is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium infusions. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,068 mL and a total output of 1,110 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,958 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.41, pCO2 of 46, pO2 of 69, and bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 30. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's assessment includes hypotension, respiratory failure, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The patient's care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which showed no organisms. She has been weaned off pressure support for over 14 hours but appeared fatigued and was switched back to assist control with poor blood gases. The patient received a blood transfusion for anemia and continues to receive sedation and pain management medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains on ventilatory support. She has a history of chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and GERD. The patient's family has been informed and is involved in her care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to wean from ventilator: The patient has shown fatigue and poor blood gases when attempted to be weaned from pressure support, indicating potential complications in weaning from the ventilator.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation suggests a possible community-acquired pneumonia, which may complicate her respiratory failure.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although not confirmed as ARDS, the patient's diffuse severe interstitial lung disease seen on CT chest raises the concern for ARDS development.
4. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as transfer from OSH following possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. She has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone various interventions.

Based on the progress note, the patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Respiratory failure/pneumonia: The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, with possible history of COPD or interstitial lung disease. The patient is currently on steroids for pneumonitis or steroid-responsive illness. A bronchoscopy was performed, which was relatively unremarkable, and sputum cultures are being followed up.
- Decreased hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit has been trending down from admission, likely due to phlebotomy. A blood transfusion has been ordered to increase the hematocrit level to above 25.
- Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and Phenylephrine has been discontinued. Fluid administration has been increased, and urine output is being monitored.
- FEN (tube feeds): Tube feeds have been held due to high residual volume, but will be resumed as tolerated.
- Hypothyroidism: Synthroid is being continued.
- Hyperlipidemia: Lipitor is currently held due to ongoing tube feeding.
- Chronic kidney disease (Cr 1.4): There has been an improvement from baseline, and medications will be adjusted as needed for renal insufficiency.
- Osteoporosis: No acute issues were noted.
- GERD: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is ongoing.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is still compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has possible bacterial pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Decreased hematocrit: The patient's low hematocrit levels indicate anemia, which may contribute to fatigue and poor oxygenation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's stable blood pressure is being closely monitored, but there is a risk of hypoperfusion or shock if adequate perfusion is not maintained.
5. FEN intolerance: The patient's intolerance to tube feeds suggests a risk of malnutrition or aspiration if not managed appropriately.
6. Hypothyroidism: Inadequate thyroid hormone levels can impact metabolism and organ function, leading to various complications.
7. Hyperlipidemia: Elevated lipid levels can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis.
8. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and further deterioration may occur if renal insufficiency is not managed properly.
9. Osteoporosis: The patient's history of compression fractures indicates an increased risk of bone fractures and skeletal complications.
10. GERD: Uncontrolled acid reflux can lead to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory complications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy which showed no organisms. She has been on pressure support and assist control ventilation, but appeared fatigued and had poor blood gas exchange. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia. She received a blood transfusion for anemia and is being treated with corticosteroids for suspected pneumonitis or steroid-responsive illness. Her condition remains unstable, and she is still dependent on the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, is crucial.
2. Barotrauma: The high levels of positive pressure during mechanical ventilation can cause barotrauma, leading to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Close monitoring of chest imaging and clinical signs like subcutaneous emphysema or hemodynamic instability is important.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Excessive mechanical stress from overdistention of the alveoli can lead to VILI. Adjustments in ventilator settings may be necessary to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and suspected pneumonia. She has been on mechanical ventilation but has not been able to wean off the ventilator successfully. The patient's recent bronchoscopy showed no organisms, and she has been off antibiotics since November 27th. Her blood cultures have been negative to date. She is receiving sedation and pain management medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing hypotension. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, but she still requires higher levels of oxygen and PEEP to maintain oxygenation. Her blood gas levels indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's anemia has been addressed with a blood transfusion, and her Hct has increased from 21.4 to 26.9. Her kidney function has also improved. The patient's family has been involved in discussions regarding her care, and a plan for a family meeting has been made to address the goals of care. The patient's nutritional status is being managed with tube feeds, and her glycemic control is being monitored. She is at risk for DVT and stress ulcers, so appropriate prophylaxis measures are in place. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to wean from ventilator: The patient's inability to wean from mechanical ventilation indicates a potential complication related to respiratory failure. This can be attributed"

   Patient has not shown any improvement in the past 24 hours. Continues
   on high dose steroids. Patient was on FIO2=0.7 this AM. We increased
   the PEEP to 12 and reduced the FIO2 to 0.6. Patient is using expiratory
   accessory muscles. This did not seem to be related to PEEP; did not
   change when we brought PEEP down to 5.  Likely represents some
   increased airway resistance due to COPD. BNP is up; may represent
   stretch of RV with pulmonary hypertension. Will try to diurese today,
   however, on chance that some of what we are seeing on CXR represents
   fluid.
   Continue with antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
   Hct is up. No need for transfusion now.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, interstitial lung disease (ILD), pneumonia, and anemia. They have been intubated and placed on volume ventilation due to marginal oxygenation. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and received antibiotics for possible pneumonia. They are also being treated with high-dose steroids.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/117 mmHg to 87/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and they have a slight edema in both lower extremities.

Lab results show a low white blood cell count, slightly elevated potassium levels, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range, but other lab values indicate potential issues with renal function and electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's imaging shows diffuse interstitial markings on the chest X-ray, which could indicate a small effusion. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypotension, anemia, pulmonary hypertension, and potential fluid overload. The patient continues to require ICU care with tube feeding, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated"

   # Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  CT with findings of interstitial
   disease.  Initiated steroid therapy on [**11-27**]. Off antibiotics since
   [**11-27**] given lack of evidence for infection.  Switched to PCV+ to help
   minimize both volume and pressure trauma.  Appears to be tolerating
   current settings well, although has been unable to achieve adequate
   PaO2 with FIO2 <60.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and possible pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia and is being treated with steroids and antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 141/60 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. She has an elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, but her electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's chest x-ray shows interstitial disease, and she has bibasilar rales on auscultation. The patient's condition is improving, with a decrease in her Hct from 21.4 to 26.9 after receiving a blood transfusion. Her fluid balance is positive, with a total input of 977 mL and output of 1473 mL. The patient's tracheostomy tube is planned to be replaced, and she is being weaned off sedation. The plan is to have a family meeting to discuss the goals of care. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently on full support in the ICU.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who has been admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and sedated but arousable, denying any pain. The vital signs show a stable heart rate and blood pressure, but the patient is experiencing low oxygen saturation levels (SpO2: 90%). 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a mode of PCV+ (pressure-controlled ventilation with spontaneous breaths). The set tidal volume (Vt) is 401 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 26 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 12 cmH2O, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, PaO2 of 160 mmHg, and HCO3- of 32 mEq/L.

The physical examination reveals bibasilar rales in the lungs, with clear chest sounds otherwise. The patient's neurological assessment shows that she is arousable to verbal stimuli and responds to commands. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly low hemoglobin (9.1 g/dL), elevated potassium (5.3 mEq/L), and a creatinine level of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. They have a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonia. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide their own medical history.

Over the past day, the patient's fluid balance has been negative by 500 ml with the use of lasix. The ventilator mode was switched to pressure control ventilation with acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) results. The oxygenation has improved with the use of 50% oxygen and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures have been non-revealing.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 79 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 127/68 to 150/92 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 89%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, mild use of accessory muscles, crackles bibasilar in the left lung, and a systolic murmur heard best at the base. There is also mild edema in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) at 9.1 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) at 8.3 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) at 373 K/uL, blood glucose at 129 mg/dL, and creatinine (Cr) at 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
- Hypotension
- Respiratory failure
- Bacterial pneumonia, community-acquired (CAP)
- Anemia

The plan includes continuing antibiotics and steroids for possible pneumonia and ILD. Cultures remain negative. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0.5-1.0 liter today and reduce PEEP from 12 to 10 if oxygenation improves. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, so no transfusion is needed at this time. ICU care will continue with appropriate nutrition, glycemic control, lines in place, prophylaxis measures, and communication with the interdisciplinary team."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is still intubated and has not yet been successfully extubated. The patient's sputum culture revealed budding yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible fungal and bacterial infection. The patient is currently receiving Vancomycin for treatment.

The patient's FiO2 was decreased from 60 to 50, and then transiently increased to 70% before returning to 60%. The PaO2 stabilized with the last ABG. The patient also received a total of 30 IV Lasix over the course of the day.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99°F), a heart rate of 69 bpm with a sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 120/56 to 171/117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,900 mL, including 562 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 2,763 mL, with 320 mL of urine output.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in PCV+Assist mode with a tidal volume of 570 mL, FiO2 of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure of 32 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 12 cmH2O.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. She has been intubated for 8 days. The patient's sputum gram stain showed budding yeast and GPC, so she was started on vancomycin. Her FiO2 was decreased from 60 to 50, and transiently increased to 70% with stabilization of PaO2. She received a total of 30IV Lasix over the course of the day. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/56 to 171/117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's neurological examination shows that she is minimally arousable to verbal stimuli, opens eyes to commands, and is somnolent/sedated. Her labs show normal WBC count, Hct, and platelet levels, but slightly elevated glucose levels. The patient's microbiology report indicates the presence of budding yeast and GPC in her sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to her inability to achieve adequate PaO2 with FiO2 <60. There is a plan to switch to CPAP trial this morning.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sput"

   ANEMIA
   Oxygen requirements persist despite two days of diuresis. BUN/Creat
   ration is elevated; BUN has risen from 27 to 36 since admission. I do
   not think  we should try to diurese any further; urine output has
   dropped off signficantly in the last few hours consistent with the
   patient becoming intravascularly volume depleted. Still  on pressure
   control ventilation; has been requiring more sedation for increased
   work of breathing/agitation. Switch to PSV today on rounds. Patient
   taking bigger tidal volumes; the tidal volume restriction probably was
   contributing to her agitation. With clearing of alveolar opacities with
   diuresis, I am less convinced that she has ARDS, and will allow her to
   take bigger tidal volumes.
   Patient has been intubated for a total of 16 days at [**Hospital3 2882**] and
   here. Will discuss trach with patient's family today. Will try on PEEP
   8 today; if oxygenation stable, she would able to have a percutaneous
   trach.
   Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, ILD, and pneumonia. They are unable to provide a history due to being sedated and intubated. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has received various medications including vancomycin, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and others. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/63 to 171/117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on 60% oxygen delivery through an endotracheal tube with PCV+ ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 570 mL, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) deferred due to FiO2 > 60%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 12 cmH2O.

Fluid balance shows a negative fluid balance of nearly 1 L achieved yesterday. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and creatinine (Cr), along with decreased levels of potassium (K+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and calcium (Ca++). Imaging reveals diffuse interstitial markings with improvement in the alveolar component in the left lung.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension (not in shock)
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
3. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP)
4. Anemia

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - due to prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
3. Stress ulcers - due to critical illness and sedation.
4. Nosocomial infection - due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
6. Prolonged mechanical ventilation - due to persistent respiratory failure.
7. Tracheostomy - planned for long-term airway management.

The patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was switched to CPAP in the morning with good results, maintaining a good oxygen saturation level of 92% on 50% FiO2. The patient received 500cc of normal saline for low urine output, which responded well. A family meeting was held to discuss the goals of care and plan for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient has allergies to penicillins and experienced anaphylaxis. The patient is currently on midazolam (versed) and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. Heparin sodium is being administered as a prophylactic measure. Other medications include nutrition support through Nutren Pulmonary and glycemic control.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 65 bpm with a range of 63-95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/54 mmHg to 196/161 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 11-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypotension, respiratory failure, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is currently on CPAP in the ICU and has shown good oxygen saturation on 50% FiO2. He received 500cc LR for low urine output with a good response. A family meeting was held to discuss the patient's goals of care, and plans for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were made. The patient is also on various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and others. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/54-143/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,442 mL and output of 1,102 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and is on CPAP mode with a tidal volume of 641 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 174. The patient's lab results indicate elevated leukocyte count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. The patient's HCT, WBC, and platelet count are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated. The patient's imaging studies show no significant abnormalities. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which increases the risk of further infections in the ICU, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a progression of pneumonia or complications from mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension could indicate a risk of recurrent low blood pressure, leading to inadequate organ perfusion.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake exceeding output since midnight, which could lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
5. Medication side effects: Some of the medications the patient is receiving, such as sedatives (midazolam) and opioids (fentanyl), may have side effects like respiratory depression or tolerance.
6. Tracheostomy complications: The planned tracheostomy carries"

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and pneumonia. They are currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and able to stay on 50% oxygen with a PEEP of 8. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

Allergies include penicillins with anaphylaxis. The last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin.

The patient is receiving several infusions including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. They are also on other medications such as ASA, synthoid, chlorhexidine, solumedrol, and reglan.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

The physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and not in acute distress. Eyes, head and neck, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, respiratory/chest, abdominal, extremities, musculoskeletal, and neurologic assessments are all within normal limits or show no abnormalities.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and other lab values. Imaging shows a chest X-ray with no significant change.

The assessment and plan include hypotension, respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, and potential complications such as congestive heart failure"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and pneumonia. She has been intubated for 10 days and requires mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Failure to wean from ventilator: The patient remains dependent on mechanical ventilation and attempts to decrease ventilator settings have been made, but she still requires support.
2. Positive sputum gram stain for GPC and yeast: Initially, the patient was started on vancomycin, but it was discontinued due to no evidence of pneumonia.
3. Good oxygen saturation with 50% FiO2: The patient's oxygen levels are stable with the current FiO2 setting.
4. Increased PEEP from 5 to 12 for adequate oxygenation: The patient required an increase in PEEP to maintain adequate oxygen levels.
5. Diuresis with good response on CXR: The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement in fluid status after diuresis.
6. Dry appearance according to labs: Despite diuresis, the patient's labs indicate that she appears dry.
7. Goal I/O even to negative 1 L: The patient's input/output balance should be maintained with the goal of evenness or a negative balance of up to 1 L.
8. Anemia stable at 30.2: The patient's anemia level is currently stable, and transfusion should be considered if"

   # Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: Likely [**1-16**] to ILD/COPD. No evidence of
   pulmonary infection. Sputum gram stain [**11-30**] positive for GPC and
   Yeast.  Pt now started on vancomycin (day 1 [**11-30**]) which was d/cd [**12-2**]
   given no evidence of pna.   Remains on Steroids since [**11-27**] and
   continued to require mechanical ventilation, but now good sats with
   50% FiO2. Required increased peep from 5 to 12 for adequate oxygention
   yesterday .Diuresis with good reponse on CXR, although by labs, pt
   appears dry.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. She has been intubated for 10 days and is still requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 158/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 50% FiO2. The patient's physical examination reveals no jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis, and she has distal pulses with mild pitting edema in her extremities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient likely has underlying ILD/COPD and there is no evidence of pulmonary infection. She was previously on vancomycin but it was discontinued as there was no evidence of pneumonia. She remains on steroids and continues to require mechanical ventilation. Her oxygen saturation is good with 50% FiO2 and she required increased PEEP from 5 to 12 for adequate oxygenation yesterday. Diuresis with a good response is seen on CXR, although her labs indicate she appears dry.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of failure to wean from the ventilator. The patient has a history of pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, and is being treated with antibiotics and other medications.

From the 24-hour events, it is mentioned that the patient's PEEP was less than 10, and a plan was made to perform tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) the next day. The patient is continuing to receive high-dose Solumedrol and will begin tapering down to 60 mg per day tomorrow. The patient also received Lasix to manage fluid balance.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/46 mmHg to 158/138 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 55, PaO2 of 150, and oxygen saturation of 92%.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net positive fluid intake of 390cc at 1500, with a total output of 1941 mL. The respiratory support mode is CPAP/PSV, with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic parameters. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events such as barotrauma or volutrauma due to high airway pressures, fluid overload due to the positive fluid balance, and sedation-related hypertension."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who has been intubated for 10 days due to respiratory failure and pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation but has shown improvement in oxygen saturation with 50% FiO2. Her lab results indicate stable anemia, resolution of hypotension, and improvement in chronic kidney disease. Other medical conditions include hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, GERD, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is also on tube feeds and being weaned off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator suggests a risk of continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings may be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of GPC in the sputum gram stain indicates a bacterial infection, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotics. The patient's response to treatment should be closely monitored.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 29.6. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration for transfusion if under 21 may be required.
4. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension. Monitoring urine output and fluid balance will help guide management.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's creatinine level has improved from baseline, but ongoing monitoring"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and hypotension. They have been admitted to the ICU and are on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 158/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and they have a history of anaphylaxis. The patient has received various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged stay on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and sputum cultures will be important for early detection and management.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 335 mL over 24 hours, indicating potential fluid overload. This can contribute to respiratory distress and increase the risk of complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Barotrauma: The patient's high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O suggests the possibility of barotrauma. Close monitoring of PIP and"

   She did not end up getting as neg as she should have and is still
   having end exp grunt this AM. More diuresis will be our initial plan.
   Yesterday, we had reduced PEEP to 5 cm H2O but she had some issues with
   hypoxemia so back up to 10 now.   Can try to up driving pressures to
   see if improved comfort but seems she should not need as TV are 550 and
   bicarb is 35 with a compensated ph and PCAO2 55. That said her PAC02 is
   up from 40s so may have pushed to far and too fast.
   Volume status: positive, breathing pattern showing an end-expiratory

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and pneumonia. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding their respiratory status and volume status. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypertension and ventilator dysynchrony. A plan has been made to reduce the use of diuretics and increase the driving pressures to improve comfort. Sputum cultures have grown oral flora, and vancomycin has been stopped. The patient's hematocrit levels are stable, and there is no evidence of bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure, they are at risk for developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is crucial.
2. Barotrauma: The increased driving pressures and high peak inspiratory pressures may lead to barotrauma, which can cause lung injury. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance suggests the possibility of fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function. Careful monitoring of fluid intake and output is essential.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospitalization and the use of invasive devices increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as bloodstream infections or catheter-related infections. Regular assessment of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of community-acquired pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
- The patient's vital signs show hypertension and tachycardia.
- The patient has been intubated and placed on CPAP/PSV ventilation support.
- The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and lasix.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels.
- The patient's arterial blood gases and respiratory support indicate ongoing respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT formation.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers, which may result in gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential fluid overload.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function, which could be due to AKI.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's tachycard"

   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from OSH following possible pneumonia and failure to extubate;
   now intubated x 10 days.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: Likely [**1-16**] to ILD/COPD. No evidence of
   pulmonary infection. Sputum gram stain [**11-30**] positive for GPC and
   Yeast.    Remains on Steroids since [**11-27**] and continued to require
   mechanical ventilation, but now good sats with  50% FiO2.  Required
   increased peep from 5 to 12 for adequate oxygention yesterday.
   Diuresis with good reponse on CXR, although by labs, pt appears dry.
   - daily wake up
   - Attempt to wean ventilator settings. Decrease PEEP to 8 and continue
   Pressure Support Ventilation. Goal PEEP less than 10 prior to trach.
   Recheck abg.
   - IP consulted re: possible trach next week
   - Attempt diuresis incase the is a component of pulmonary ededa
   contributing to respiratory failure (hypoxemia)
   - solumedrol 80 TID
 60 mg TID
   # Fluid Status: Goal I/O negative 1 L
   # Anemia:  stable at 30.2
   - Transfuse if under 21
   # Hypotension:  Resolved; now off pressors with pressures between 112
   and 158.
   - monitor UOP- fluids for goal UOP >50cc/hr
   # FEN:  tube feeds as tolerated
   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: lipitor currently held due to OG tube.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease (Cr 1.4): improved from baseline.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues
   # GERD: PPI

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD and ILD who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 122/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient has received several interventions, including switching to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV+), administering Lasix for negative fluid balance, and weaning off steroids. She also has allergies to penicillins and has received vancomycin as her last dose of antibiotics. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelets. However, her electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with low potassium and magnesium levels. Her liver function tests are within normal range, but her kidney function is not specified. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral crackles bilaterally with inspiration, but no wheezes. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, PCV+ assist mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume (Vt) of 451 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 40 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. 

The patient's ABG reveals a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 56 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 84 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 95%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated and sedated, with warm skin and no rash. Her neurological status is described as sedated, with open eyes to request. 

The patient's assessment includes acute respiratory failure, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and hypotension. The plan involves tracheostomy, continued mechanical ventilation, and other supportive measures. 

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and complications related to the tracheostomy procedure."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD and ILD who is currently in respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits, blood pressure slightly low but stable, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 95%. Her fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,227 mL and output of 2,623 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,396 mL. 

The patient is receiving several medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, Lasix, heparin, and nutritional support through a pulmonary formula. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels. The platelet count is within normal range, as well as liver function tests and electrolyte levels. 

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute pneumonia (CAP), hypotension, anemia, and anxiety. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy to facilitate long-term ventilation and wean off sedation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility. Additionally, there is a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged bed rest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The goal is to wean her off the ventilator, but she has not been successful so far. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 122/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is sedated but minimally arousable to verbal stimuli.

The patient has shown some improvement as she is now able to open her eyes to commands and respond to verbal stimuli. However, she remains somnolent and non-responsive to questioning. Her physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the heart, lungs, abdomen, or skin. There is mild edema in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, but all other parameters are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels are also within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, she is at risk for developing VAP. Regular surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient does not currently have any signs of DVT, the presence of edema in the lower extremities"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. She has been intubated for 11 days. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, hypotension, fluid status, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, GERD, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator indicates ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to complications such as pneumonia or COPD exacerbation.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of GPC and yeast in the sputum gram stain suggests a possible bacterial and fungal infection. If left untreated, this could lead to worsening pneumonia and sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL indicates anemia. If not properly managed, anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension due to factors like sepsis or medication side effects.
5. Fluid Status: The goal of maintaining a negative fluid balance may be challenging, especially if the patient's renal function is impaired.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, currently admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. She has been intubated for 11 days. The patient's main issue is her inability to wean off the ventilator. Her recent progress includes being given 20mg of lasix with a good response, weaning of peep to 10, and swelling of the left upper extremity. An ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Tube feeds were held at midnight due to the possibility of performing a tracheostomy, which can be restarted if not planned until December 6th.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is her failure to wean from the ventilator, indicating ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of possible pneumonia, and although there is no current evidence of pulmonary infection, sputum gram stain is positive for GPC and yeast. This suggests a potential risk for pneumonia.
3. DVT: The patient has swelling in the left upper extremity, and although the ultrasound was negative for DVT, the risk of developing a blood clot should be closely monitored.
4. Tracheostomy: The patient is a candidate for a tracheostomy, which carries its own set of complications such as bleeding, infection, and damage to structures in the neck.
5. Hypotension: The patient had resolved hypotension, but close monitoring of blood pressure and urine output is necessary to ensure adequate fluid balance.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Regular monitoring of renal function is essential.
7. Hyperlipidemia: Although the patient's lipitor is currently held, she has a history of hyperlipidemia, which increases the risk of cardiovascular events.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of compression fractures, making her more susceptible to bone-related complications.
9. GERD: The patient is on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for GERD, which can increase the risk of certain gastrointestinal infections.

The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring and management of respiratory function, infection risk, and potential complications associated with her underlying medical conditions."

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who has been intubated for 11 days due to respiratory failure and pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The goal is to keep her negative fluid balance and wean her off sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Failure to wean from ventilator: The patient's inability to breathe independently may indicate underlying lung issues or inadequate sedation management.

2. Pulmonary infection: Although there is no evidence of active infection at the moment, the presence of GPC and yeast in the sputum gram stain suggests a risk of pneumonia. This could contribute to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of complications.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient had swelling of the left upper extremity, but an ultrasound was negative for DVT. However, due to immobility and risk factors, there is still a potential risk for developing DVT.

4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are stable, indicating improvement from baseline. However, CKD can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and decreased drug clearance.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has resolved and is now off pressors, but close monitoring of urine output and fluid balance is necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of failure to wean from ventilator. The patient has been given 20mg of Lasix with a good response, and the Peep has been weaned to 10. The patient also experienced swelling in the left upper extremity, but an ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Tube feeds were held at midnight in preparation for a possible tracheostomy, which can be restarted if not planned until 12-6.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and experienced anaphylaxis in the past. The last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin at 07:37 AM. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at 5 mg/hour and fentanyl at 175 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) at 09:33 PM and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at 12:09 AM.

The patient's medical and family history is unchanged from admission except for the noted review of systems. The flow sheet data shows vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and normal creatinine levels. Other lab results, including PT/PT"

Key findings from the note include:
- The patient has a history of penicillin allergy.
- The patient is unable to provide history as they are sedated and intubated.
- The patient remains intubated with mechanical ventilation support.
- There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/39 to 163/100 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 98%, and temperature within normal range.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels.
- Imaging studies are mentioned but not provided in the note.
- The patient has been receiving various medications including sedatives, analgesics, diuretics, and proton pump inhibitors.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and implementing daily weaning trials are being taken to prevent"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia and underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD). They are currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and is receiving sedation and pain medication. They are unable to provide a history themselves.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/39 to 163/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2246 mL and output of 1590 mL.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Their eyes are normal, with no signs of conjunctival edema or scleral icterus. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm and no murmurs, S3, or S4 heart sounds. The respiratory examination is notable for clear breath sounds without wheezes or crackles. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. The extremities are warm and have no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 15.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 201 K/uL, sodium of 110 mg/dL, potassium of 0.5 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose of 121 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas values indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 184.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent due to pneumonia and underlying ILD. Mechanical ventilation will continue, and efforts will be made to maintain SaO2 above 90%. Consideration may be given to changing the mode to inverse ratio pressure-controlled ventilation (IPS).

2. ILD: The patient's ILD is currently being treated with steroids, but no further therapy is available. Steroid treatment will continue.

3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance should be monitored closely to maintain euvolemia and prevent both hypotension and fluid overload.

4. Nutritional Support: The patient is currently on tube feeds (TF) on hold, with plans for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Nutritional support is important to maintain the patient's nutritional status during their critical illness.

5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but it should be monitored closely.

6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She was transferred from OSH due to possible pneumonia and failure to extubate. The patient has been intubated for 12 days and recently underwent tracheostomy. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Her vital signs are stable, but she experienced an episode of hypotension and bradycardia last night, which was likely due to mucous plugging. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and there is a goal I/O negative 500 to avoid hypotension. Her WBC count is slightly elevated, but other lab results are within normal limits. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and GERD. The plan is to wean off sedation and gradually decrease PEEP. Frequent suctioning and monitoring for hypotension/bradycardia are essential. Tube feeds will be initiated once the patient tolerates it.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU with possible pneumonia and failure to extubate.
- She has been intubated for 11 days and underwent various procedures, including bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy, endoscopy, and PEG insertion.
- The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, hypoxia, and abnormal heart rhythms, but these were resolved with appropriate interventions.
- Her vital signs remain relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/57 to 88/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 40 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 37 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%.
- Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated hematocrit, and normal platelet count.
- Other lab values, including electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes, and blood glucose levels, are within normal limits.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -735 mL and -382 mL since midnight.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who presents with possible pneumonia and respiratory failure. She has been intubated for 11 days and is currently in the ICU. The patient has undergone several procedures, including bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy, endoscopy, and PEG insertion. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/57 to 88/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Other lab values, including liver enzymes and blood glucose, are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, and hypotension. The respiratory failure is likely due to underlying COPD and ILD. The pneumonia is community-acquired and caused by gram-positive cocci and yeast. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is off pressors with stable blood pressures.

The plan includes daily wake-up calls, reducing PEEP from 8 to 5, performing tracheostomy and PEG insertion, and maintaining even"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute and chronic. He has underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD) and recently had pneumonia. There was an episode of hypotension and bradycardia which resolved. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further complications or deterioration in lung function.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper elevation of the head of bed and other preventive measures should be taken.
3. Ventilator-Associated Events (VAEs): Other events such as ventilator-associated conditions (VAC), infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC), and possible or probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should also be monitored for.
4. Tracheostomy Complications: Although the patient recently had a percutaneous tracheostomy, potential complications like tracheal stenosis, infection, or dislocation need to be considered.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: PEG insertion carries a small risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and anemia.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can lead to DVT and potentially PE if they dislodge and travel to the lungs.
7. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to chronic illness and treatment, increasing the risk of infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or bloodstream infections.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and promptly address potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient underwent several procedures, including bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy, endoscopy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion.

The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia and hypotension last night, which was resolved with suctioning of a mucus plug. The patient has allergies to penicillins and receives midazolam, vecuronium, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium infusions in the ICU. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on ventilator support. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a plateau pressure of 37 cmH2O. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normal pupils, clear breath sounds bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no obvious edema or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal tone.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 180 K/u"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD and restrictive lung disease. She was transferred to the ICU due to pneumonia and failure to extubate. The patient has been intubated for 13 days and has been on mechanical ventilation. She is currently on SIMV mode but tolerated poorly and was switched back to PC (pressure control) mode. The patient's respiratory cultures are unremarkable except for moderate yeast. She has been started on fentanyl wean from IV to patch and tapered solumedrol to 40 TID. Gtube feeds have also been initiated. The patient has allergies to penicillins and experienced anaphylaxis. She has a history of hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, and GERD. Mobilization and PT consult have been requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may worsen due to underlying COPD and restrictive lung disease, which could contribute to respiratory failure.
2. Mucous Plugging: The patient may experience episodes of hypotension/bradycardia due to mucous plugging, which can lead to decreased oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Fluid Status: The patient's fluid status needs close monitoring, as there is a goal for even I/O (input/output) balance. Inappropriate fluid management may lead to fluid overload or dehydration.
4. Infection: Although the"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from OSH following possible pneumonia and failure to extubate;
   now intubated x 12 days.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely [**1-16**] to COPD and flare of interstitial
   lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary infection. Unable to wean off
   vent so S/P trach yesterday, doing well.
   - daily wake up
   - Given appropriate oxygen saturation, plan to decrease peep from 8 to
   5
   - keep i/o even roughly
   - Taper steroids today and tomorrow 40 tid then decrease again
   # Episode of Hypotension/Bradycardia: Likely [**1-16**] mucous plugging
   -monitor closely
   -frequent suctioning.
   - monitor UOP- fluids for goal UOP >50cc/hr
   # Fluid Status: Goal I/O negative 500 rather than more given
   hypotension last night (though probably due to mucous plug)
   # Anemia:  stable at 28.1
   - Transfuse if under 21
   # FEN:  tube feeds as tolerated  once ok to use PEG.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease (Cr 0.4): improved from baseline.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues
   # GERD: PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD and restrictive lung disease.
- She was transferred from OSH with pneumonia and failure to extubate, now intubated for 12 days.
- The respiratory culture showed moderate yeast growth but no evidence of pulmonary infection.
- She is currently on a fentanyl patch and gtt for pain management, as well as versed for sedation.
- She is being weaned off IV steroids.
- She tolerated different vent settings, including PCV+Assist, but did not tolerate SIMV.
- Diuresis goal of -500 cc achieved.
- Started on tube feeds and rehabilitation screening.
- Allergies include penicillins and anaphylaxis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/52 to 180/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 589 mL and output of 124 mL.
- She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 451 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance of 17.3 cmH2O/mL.
- Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels.
- Assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to COPD and interstitial lung disease, hypotension/bradycardia possibly due to mucous plugging, fluid status with a goal of negative 500 mL input-output balance, anemia with stable hemoglobin, and various other medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, GERD, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and restrictive lung disease may contribute to respiratory failure, especially if there is a flare-up of interstitial lung disease. Close monitoring and appropriate management of the ventilator settings are crucial.
2. Hypotension/Bradycardia: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension/bradycardia, which could be due to mucous plugging. Continuous monitoring and frequent suctioning are necessary to prevent further episodes.
3. Fluid Status: The patient's fluid status should be carefully managed to achieve a negative 500 cc input-output balance. Excessive fluid administration can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory status.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 28.1 g/dL, and transfusion is only indicated if the hemoglobin falls below 21 g/dL. Close monitoring of the hemoglobin levels is essential.
5. Infection: Although the respiratory culture showed no evidence of pulmonary infection, the patient is still at risk of developing infections, especially since she is intubated. Prompt identification and treatment of any infection are crucial.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immob"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from after failure to extubate; intubated x 13 days.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely [**1-16**] to COPD and flare of interstitial
   lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary infection on sputum cultures.
   s/p trach, unable to change over to AC/SIMV, so returned to PC.
   - PS trial
   - wean sedation (fentanyl to patch, versed to valium)
   - continue solumedrol at 40 IV TID, continue taper tomorrow
   # Episode of Hypotension/Bradycardia: Likely [**1-16**] mucous plugging
   -monitor closely
   -frequent suctioning.
   -I/O goal even today.
   # Fluid Status: Goal I/O goal even w/ recheck in PM for consideration
   to Lasix administration.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: stable
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues
   # GERD: PPI

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD and restrictive lung disease who was transferred from another facility with pneumonia and failure to extubate. The patient has been intubated for 13 days and is currently in the ICU. The patient has attempted to tolerate AC and SIMV modes of ventilation but did not tolerate them well. She has been placed back on PCV+Assist mode. The patient's respiratory cultures came back unremarkable with moderate yeast present. The patient is on fentanyl wean from IV to patch and is also receiving sedation with midazolam. The patient's solumedrol dose has been tapered to 40 TID, and she has started receiving tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and restrictive lung disease, along with the current respiratory failure, increases the risk of further respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxia or hypercapnia.
2. Episode of Hypotension/Bradycardia: The patient's episode of hypotension and bradycardia is likely due to mucous plugging. Close monitoring and frequent suctioning are necessary to prevent recurrent episodes.
3. Fluid Status: The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored to avoid fluid overload or dehydration.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and it needs to be managed appropriately with medication.

- The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which is acute and chronic in nature. The underlying cause is suspected to be interstitial lung disease (ILD), possibly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP).
- The patient's best tolerance is with pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode and poor tolerance to intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), and assist-control (AC) modes.
- The patient's secretions are minimal, and they appear more awake and comfortable. They deny experiencing pain or dyspnea.
- The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins and is unable to provide their own history due to endotracheal tube (ETT) placement.
- The patient's allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other ICU medications are noted.
- The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except for a few noted exceptions.
- Vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings are provided.
- Laboratory results, including blood gases, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, glucose, albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and liver function tests, are mentioned.
- Assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure due to ILD, hyp"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have a history of respiratory failure, acute and chronic, with underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/49 mmHg to 180/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is sedated but appears more awake and comfortable. They deny any pain or dyspnea. 

The patient has several medical conditions, including pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, anemia, and weakness. They are receiving various treatments, including mechanical ventilation, fluid management, nutritional support, pain management, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying ILD and recent pneumonia put them at risk for persistent respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should implement appropriate strategies, such as head-of-bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and oral"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and they are currently on PCV mode ventilation due to poor tolerance of other modes.

The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and is receiving continuous infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. They are also receiving prophylactic heparin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 69-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/49-61 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for hyperglycemia. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of pain or dyspnea.

The laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 130, suggesting adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes community-acquired pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, but not ARDS. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of hypotension, respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, and ICU"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presented to the hospital with respiratory failure and failure to extubate. 

The patient attempted a spontaneous breathing trial (PS trial) but tolerated it with a slight increase in acidoses. Therefore, she was returned to mechanical ventilation (PC mode). Weaning of sedation is ongoing, with the use of Valium instead of Versed. Steroids are being continued at 40 mg IV TID, with a plan to taper tomorrow.

The patient's input/output (I/O) is negative, and consideration is being given to administering IV Lasix if the I/O remains positive. Bedside chest X-rays were obtained, but no acute issues were noted.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate ranging from 69-113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94-161 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, slightly low platelet count, and normal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD and interstitial lung disease who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and failure to extubate. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has been unable to be weaned off. The patient has hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea, which have resolved with mucous suctioning, increased PEEP, and increased sedation. She is allergic to penicillins and has a last dose of antibiotics. The patient is on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, lactulose, solumedrol, combivent, reglan, colace, tylenol, senna, ASA, and levothyroxine. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/69 to 172/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with COPD and ILD who presented from OSH with respiratory failure and failure to extubate. The patient tolerated a pressure support trial but showed a slight increase in acidosisis. Weaning sedation was attempted, and steroids were continued at 40 TID, tapering to 40 on Hospital1 7. The patient is currently on bedrest at Hospital1 997, Location 23, and is scheduled for re-evaluation on Friday/Monday to determine if she can go.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD and ILD, there is a risk of further respiratory failure or complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, which could lead to cardiovascular complications like heart attack or stroke.
3. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk of developing infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and advanced age increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can potentially travel to the lungs causing a PE.
5. Stress Ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to the prolonged use of sedatives and steroids.
6. Delirium: Older adults in the"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with COPD and ILD who presents with respiratory failure and failure to extubate. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and receiving sedation. The patient has been hypertensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic at times, but these issues were resolved with mucous suctioning, increased PEEP, and increased sedation. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6°C, heart rate 88 bpm, blood pressure 161/69 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 94%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels, with slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to COPD and a flare of interstitial lung disease. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but remains unable to be changed from pressure-controlled (PC) mode to pressure support (PS) mode. This may indicate ongoing respiratory distress and the need for continued ventilatory support.
2. Aspiration Risk: The patient has multiple secretions and appears agitated, putting her at risk for aspiration. Close monitoring and appropriate measures to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD and other comorbidities such as hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, and GERD. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and failure to extubate after a previous intubation for 14 days. She is currently on CPAP and sedated with fentanyl and versed for comfort. The family has decided to make her a DNR (do not resuscitate) and will have a family meeting to discuss the goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to her underlying COPD and severe interstitial lung disease. There is a risk of further deterioration in her respiratory status.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially spread to other parts of the body.

3. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which may indicate poor perfusion and inadequate tissue oxygenation. This could be exacerbated by her respiratory failure.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours, indicating that more fluid is being lost than is being given. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and her creat"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been intubated for 13 days and is unable to be extubated. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) order in place. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 119/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, PaO2 of 235 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 465 mL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to be extubated and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring and continued weaning attempts are necessary.
2. Hypotension/Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension and bradycardia, likely due to mucous plugging. Frequent suctioning and aggressive fluid management should be implemented.
3. Fluid Status: The patient has a goal I/O (input/output) balance even, with plans to administer Lasix for gentle"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, both acute and chronic, due to underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient has been mechanically ventilated via tracheotomy tube and remains on Versed and Fentanyl for sedation. They were recently admitted with pneumonia and have shown signs of pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/48 mmHg to 161/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and is unable to provide their own medical history due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being mechanically ventilated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation and daily mouth care should be implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures, such as the use of boots and systemic anticoagulation, should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic stress ulcer treatment,"

   Family meeting (including husband and daughters).  Extensive
   discussion, updated medical condition and answered all questions.  All
   family members recognize limited progress over past weeks of
   hospitalization, and unlikely recovery over immediate future.   All
   clearly state that pt. althoug
fighter
 would not want prolonged
   support if limited chance of recovery to functional state.  All in
   agreement that in the event of acute cardiac decompensation no
   resussitation is desired (ie. DNR).  At this time, plan to continue
   current level of care & support (ie. No escalation) with particular
   focus on comfort, without desire to escalate in the event of clinical
   worsening (ex. No chest tube if barrotrauma or pneumothorax).  If
   limited progress over next few days, family may consider further
   withdrawal of current level of care.  Will reassess on daily basis.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, acute and chronic, and underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD). They have been mechanically ventilated via tracheotomy tube and remain on Versed and Fentanyl infusions. The patient developed crepitus (subcutaneous emphysema) and is now on comfort measures with a DNR status. They are awaiting a decision regarding transfer to a rehabilitation facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory function and potential sepsis.
2. Barotrauma: The high pressures from mechanical ventilation may cause lung injury, leading to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The patient's underlying ILD makes them susceptible to further lung damage from the mechanical ventilation itself.
4. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
5. Cardiac decompensation: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia indicate potential cardiac issues. If left untreated, this could progress to cardiac decompensation and heart failure.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, acute and chronic, due to underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD). They have been mechanically ventilated via tracheotomy tube and are on infusions of Versed and Fentanyl. The patient has developed crepitus (subcutaneous emphysema) and has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status with a focus on comfort. The patient is awaiting a decision regarding transfer to a rehabilitation facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls should be implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic measures like the use of compression boots and systemic anticoagulation should be considered.
3. Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure may make it challenging to wean them off mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and assessment of their respiratory function are necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. Further evaluation and management are required to address this condition.
5. Weakness: The patient's weakness may be related to steroid use. A physical therapy consult may be necessary to address this issue.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with respiratory distress and failure to extubate. The patient has been intubated for 14 days. The family has declined escalation in care, including chest tubes and chest compressions, and wants to increase pain medication if the patient is uncomfortable, even if it lowers her blood pressure. The plan is to decrease steroids to 20 mg IV BID tomorrow. The patient's allergies include penicillins, with an anaphylactic reaction. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 12/7. Current medications include fentanyl, ranitidine, heparin sodium, insulin sliding scale, lactulose, solumedrol, Combivent nebs, Reglan, protonix, ASA, levothyroxine, Tylenol, Colace, and others.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress and failure to extubate. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and she has experienced anaphylaxis in the past. Her last dose of antibiotics was on 12/10/21 at 05:15 AM. She is receiving infusions of fentanyl and ranitidine, as well as prophylactic heparin sodium. Other medications include insulin sliding scale, lactulose, Solumedrol 40 IV q12H, Combivent nebs, Reglan 10 mg IV q6H, protonix, ASA 81 mg PO daily, levothyroxine 25 mcg PO daily, Tylenol, and Colace.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/48 to 157/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,248 mL and output of 1,260 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 12 mL. She is on CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume of 403 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 34 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 57 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 193, and oxygen ventilation (Ve) of 6.4 L/min. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, and she is expected to remain on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 60% for now.

Physical examination reveals a thin and anxious appearance, with clear breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Her skin is not assessed due to sedation. Neurologic examination shows that she responds to commands but tone, movement, and assessment are not evaluated.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.6-13.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1-29.4 g/dL, platelet count of 152-172 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4-0.5 mg/dL, total CO2 of 35-39 mEq/L, glucose of"

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, her creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, for which she is taking levothyroxine, as well as chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 

The patient's plan includes continuing sedation titration, tapering steroid use, Lasix administration for fluid management, physical therapy consultation, and communication with the family regarding care decisions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to underlying COPD and ILD, further deterioration of kidney function,"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 80 yo F with COPD, ILD, [**Hospital **] transferred from
   OSH for management of respiratory failure. Course c/b failed
   extubation, failure to wean, s/p course of high dose steroids for ? ILD
   flare to which there was little response, now s/p trach and PEG
   placement [**12-5**].
     Has tolerated transition to PSV though continues to require full
   support with elevated driving pressure and high PEEP.  Family mtg
   yesterday resulted in change in code status to DNR/DNI with no further
   escalation of care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD and ILD, who was transferred from another hospital for the management of respiratory failure. She has failed extubation and is currently intubated for 14 days. The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has tolerated the transition well. However, she continues to require full support with elevated driving pressures and high PEEP. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 98.8°F, blood pressure of 111/48 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-14 on PSV, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 193.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presents with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure due to severe interstitial lung disease (ILD). No evidence of pulmonary infection on sputum cultures.
2. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently on Synthroid.
3. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia but is unable to crush Lipitor, so it is being held.
4. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of compression fractures"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and failure to extubate. The patient has been intubated for 14 days. Her current condition is stable while on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with elevated driving pressures.

The family has requested no escalation in care, including no chest tubes or chest compressions. They want to increase pain medication if necessary, even if it lowers blood pressure. The plan is to decrease steroids to 20 mg IV twice daily tomorrow. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and she experienced anaphylaxis with the last dose of antibiotics.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications such as fentanyl for sedation, ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. She is also on insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, lactulose for constipation, and reglan for gastric motility.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/48 to 157/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 193. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 11.6 K/uL, but other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and is currently not planned for rehabilitation. Her code status is DNR/DNI, and she is pending a family meeting and re-evaluation in the next few days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and ILD increase the risk of respiratory failure. Her failure to extubate and reliance on mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Pneumonia: Despite no evidence of pulmonary infection on sputum cultures, the patient is at risk for pneumonia due to her prolonged intubation and immobility.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing mouth care, and assessing readiness for spontaneous breathing trials are in place to prevent VAP.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, are being used to prevent DVT.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness"

   Disposition:In ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who has been admitted to the ICU due to failure to extubate. She has been intubated for 14 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a pressure support (PS) of 21 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/55 to 170/161 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is in sinus rhythm and has a height of 66 inches.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,291 mL, with 452 mL given through the oral route, 685 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF), and 427 mL through intravenous fluids (IVF). The total output includes 835 mL through urine and 590 mL through blood products.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 531 mL, PS of 21 cmH2O, respiratory rate (RR) of 22, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 35 cmH2O, and an ABG showing pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 270, and ventilation (Ve) of 11.1 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion notes, and clear breath sounds. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present, and she has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. Neurological examination shows that she follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has intact movement, tone, and sensory functions.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.8 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.1%, platelet (Plt) count of 159 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 38 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.4 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 141 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 36 mEq/L, glucose of 192 mg/dL, and calcium (Ca++) of 8.2 mg/dL.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
    I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the
   ICU team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   the note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize
   and add the following points: 80 yo F with COPD, ILD, pHTN transferred
   from OSH for management of respiratory failure. Course c/b failed
   extubation, failure to wean, s/p course of high dose steroids for ? ILD
   flare to which there was little response, now s/p trach and PEG
   placement [**12-5**].
     Remains on PSV though continues to require full support with elevated
   driving pressure and moderate PEEP.  Per recent family mtg pt's code
   status changed to DNR/DNI with no further escalation of care.

   Primary issues include:
     * Resp failure
acute on chronic
           ILD (IPF, less likely NSIP given poor response to high dose
   steroids, continuing steroid taper, s/p treatment for pna and diuresis
   for pulm edema component)
     * COPD (without acute exac)
     * Anemia (stable)
     * Weakness (? Steroid related)
   Agree with plan to continue current supportive care.  Remains on PSV.
   Oxygenation is adequate with PEEP 12 and were able to wean FIO2 from 60
   to 50.  Continue mdis and steroid taper. Continue pain control/sedation
   as needed.  ICU prophylaxis.  SSI and fixed insulin while on steroids
   with good BS control.  Continue to update family and address goals of
   care. Palliative care consult may be helpful for family--will consult
   Monday.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD and interstitial lung disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to failure to extubate after a flare-up of her severe interstitial lung disease. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a pressure support (PS) of 21 cmH2O and has been intubated for 15 days. There is no evidence of pulmonary infection based on sputum cultures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 77-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/55 to 170/161 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is sedated with fentanyl boluses and receiving Solumedrol at a dose of 20 mg IV every 12 hours, which will be tapered to 10 mg IV every 12 hours tomorrow. The family has requested a palliative care consult and plans to discuss goals of care and comfort measures only (CMO) status in a few days.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD and interstitial lung disease, who was admitted for an ILD flare and failed to extubate. She is currently intubated for 16 days. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 149/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. She is receiving midazolam and fentanyl for sedation. Her laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal electrolytes, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to her COPD and ILD flare. This places her at risk for further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung injury.
2. Fluid Status: The patient's fluid balance is being monitored closely, with a goal of maintaining even input and output. Fluid overload or dehydration can have significant implications for her respiratory status and overall organ function.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on Synthroid for hypothyroidism, which needs to be continued to manage her thyroid hormone levels and prevent associated complications.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's ability to crush Lipitor is an issue, and it is currently"

The patient is currently intubated for 16 days and has been stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with elevated driving pressures. The goals of care have changed to work towards weaning ventilation and sedation. There is no evidence of pulmonary infection on sputum cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and flare of severe ILD may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSVT): The patient had one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). This could be a sign of underlying cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias. Further cardiac evaluation is recommended.

3. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has developed lower extremity edema, likely related to arterial lines. It is important to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and consider anticoagulation prophylaxis.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, for which she is taking le"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) who was admitted with an ILD flare and failed extubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving sedation with midazolam and analgesia with fentanyl. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 149/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 192, indicating adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 2,031 mL and output of 1,390 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 641 mL. The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated WBC count of 13.8 K/uL. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently being cared for in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily respiratory system infection (RSBI) assessments should"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from after failure to extubate; intubated x 16 days.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely [**1-16**] to mild  COPD and flare of severe
   interstitial lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary infection on sputum
   cultures. s/p trach, currently stable on PS with elevated driving
   pressures (21). Goals of care have changed per HCP, want to work
   towards weaning ventilation and sedation.
   - fam meeting to clarify goals of care
   - on fentanyl boluses for sedation. If family wishes to wean [**Last Name (LF) 494**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   need sedation wean (fentanyl IV to patch, versed to IV ativan or
   valium)
   - tapered solumedrol to 10 mg IV BID
   - decrease FiO2 to .4 and possibly PEEP today. Attempt to decrease PS
   tommorow to pull smaller tidal volumes and help correct respiratory
   alkalosis.
   # NSVT: One episode of NSVt. Mg 1.2. Hemodynamically stable.
   - continue telemetry
   - replete lytes mg > 2 k > 4 with PM lyte check
   - patient is currently DNR
   # LUE edema: likely related to A-line. Has been on ppx heparin, but
   must r/o DVT.
   - LUE U/S today

   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues
   # GERD: PPI
   # Mobilization: re-consult PT.discuss rehab with family. Possible neuro
   consult if goals of care have changed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD and ILD who is currently in the ICU due to an ILD flare and failure to extubate. The patient has been unsuccessful in weaning off the ventilator, with recent attempts resulting in increased FiO2 and pressure support requirements. A chest x-ray showed no changes. The patient has developed left upper extremity swelling, and an ultrasound is pending for further evaluation. 

The patient is unable to provide history, and allergies include penicillins with a history of anaphylaxis. Current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, steroids, insulin sliding scale, lactulose, reglan, colace, Tylenol, senna, ASA, and levothyroxine.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for respiratory failure. Vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, normal respiratory rate, and slightly reduced oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with PCV+assist mode, using 50% FiO2, and has a respiratory system compliance index deferred due to PEEP >10. ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH and normal oxygenation.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, tracheostomy tube in place, and symmetric chest expansion with resonant percussion notes. Neurologic examination is limited due to the patient being unresponsive and intubated. Labs show elevated potassium and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from after failure to extubate; intubated x 16 days.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely [**1-16**] to mild  COPD and flare of severe
   interstitial lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary infection on sputum
   cultures. s/p trach. Unable to wean off FiO2 yesterday on PS, required
   change of VS to PC. Family meeting today, family understands that
   patient prognosis is poor and patient is DNR with no further lines or
   pressors, but they still wish to work towards rehab and chronic vent
   weaning. Patient is quite weak and may have some neuromuscular etiology
   contributing to her respiratory failure, possible due to long ICU
   admission/deconditioning versus steroid myopathy.
   - attempt to change vent settings over to PS prior to going to rehab
   - sedation wean once stable on PS vent settings (fentanyl IV to patch,
   versed to IV ativan or valium)
   - changed solumedrol to PO prednisone 10 mg daily.
   - PT consult
   - possible neuro consult to assess for steroid myopathy
   - palliative care involved
   # NSVT: No further episodes of NSVT once electrolytes repleted.
   - continue telemetry
   - replete lytes mg > 2 k > 4 w/ daily lyes check.
   - patient is currently DNR
   # LUE edema: likely related to A-line. Has been on ppx heparin. No
   evidence of DVT on LUE U/S.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.

","Summary:
An 80-year-old female patient with a history of COPD and interstitial lung disease is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has been intubated for 16 days and is experiencing difficulty extubating. The patient's family is aware of the poor prognosis but wishes to pursue rehabilitation and chronic ventilator weaning. The patient is weak and may have neuromuscular etiology contributing to her respiratory failure. There are several medical complications that could arise, including NSVT, LUE edema, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, GERD, and potential ICU-related issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of mild COPD flare and severe interstitial lung disease. It is important to monitor and manage her respiratory support settings and continue efforts towards weaning off the ventilator.
2. NSVT (Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia): The patient experienced episodes of NSVT, which were resolved once electrolytes were repleted. Continuous telemetry should be continued, and daily electrolyte checks should be performed.
3. LUE Edema: The patient has left upper extremity edema, which is likely related to arterial line placement. She is currently on prophylactic heparin and has undergone a left upper extremity ultrasound, which showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4. Hypothy"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from after failure to extubate; intubated x 16 days.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely [**1-16**] to mild  COPD and flare of severe
   interstitial lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary infection on sputum
   cultures. s/p trach. Unable to wean off FiO2 yesterday on PS, required
   change of VS to PC. Family meeting today, family understands that
   patient prognosis is poor and patient is DNR with no further lines or
   pressors, but they still wish to work towards rehab and chronic vent
   weaning. Patient is quite weak and may have some neuromuscular etiology
   contributing to her respiratory failure, possible due to long ICU
   admission/deconditioning versus steroid myopathy.
   - attempt to change vent settings over to PS prior to going to rehab
   - sedation wean once stable on PS vent settings (fentanyl IV to patch,
   versed to IV ativan or valium)
   - changed solumedrol to PO prednisone 10 mg daily.
   - PT consult
   - possible neuro consult to assess for steroid myopathy
   - palliative care involved
   # NSVT: No further episodes of NSVT once electrolytes repleted.
   - continue telemetry
   - replete lytes mg > 2 k > 4 w/ daily lyes check.
   - patient is currently DNR
   # LUE edema: likely related to A-line. Has been on ppx heparin. No
   evidence of DVT on LUE U/S.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues
   # GERD: PPI

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD and interstitial lung disease. She has been intubated for 16 days due to respiratory failure and failure to extubate. The family wishes to work towards rehab and chronic ventilator weaning, but understands the patient's prognosis is poor and she is DNR.

She has a history of NSVT, LUE edema (likely related to A-line), hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and GERD. She is on multiple medications including heparin, PPI, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a flare-up of severe interstitial lung disease and mild COPD. The inability to wean off FiO2 suggests that the respiratory failure may persist.
2. Steroid Myopathy: The patient's weakness and possible neuromuscular etiology may be due to steroid myopathy caused by long-term use of corticosteroids. A neuro consult is planned to assess for this condition.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient has been on prophylaxis with heparin, there is still a risk for developing DVT,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of ILD (interstitial lung disease) who is currently in the ICU for an ILD flare and failure to extubate. The family has expressed their wish for the patient to remain DNR (do not resuscitate) and prefers to work towards ventilator weaning and rehabilitation. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) shows respiratory alkalosis with a pO2 in the 60s, indicating inadequate oxygenation despite being on 60% FiO2. The PEEP has been increased to 15 cmH2O, but this has not improved the situation. The patient also has flaccid left lower extremity with decreased brachial reflexes, suggesting a possible LMN (lower motor neuron) derangement due to steroid myopathy. Neuro consult has been requested to assess for steroid myopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 141/131 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 96%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,673 mL and output of 907 mL, with a positive balance of 1,766 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube with PCV+assist ventilation mode, set at Vt of 349 mL, PC of 35 cmH2O, RR of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from after failure to extubate; intubated x 16 days.
   # Hypotension and tachycardia: Most likely [**1-16**] sepsis associated with
   VAP (fever to 101, leukocytosis, CXR with new infiltrates at RML,
   tachycardia) bordering on severe sepsis given low U/O (<30 ccs/hr x2
   hrs), increasing hypoxia on ABG, and acutely altered
   MS/unresponsiveness. Other etiologies include auto-PEEP (given increase
   in PEEP yesterday and tachynpea), PE (less likely as had sufficient DVT
   ppx), and adrenal insufficiency given her long steroid taper.
   -          Aggressive 1L NS IVF boluses
   -          blood, urine, stool, sputum cultures
   -          start Vancomycin/Aztreonam (day 1 [**12-14**])
   -          check lactate
   -          trend fever curve, WBC, and urine output
   -          check random cortisol
   -          EKG to assess for RHS or new RBBB c/f PE
   -          Talked with family to communicate new change in care. HCP
   has agreed with no new lines or pressors, and have agreed with current
   treatment while in the process of communicating with patient
s husband
   new changes in care..
   # Respiratory Failure:  Has severe interstitial lung disease. Evidence
   of sepsis likely associated with VAP, likely reason why patient was
   progressively hypoxic on ABGs yesterday requiring increased FiO2 and
   PEEP yesterday on ventilator settings.. Patient is quite weak and may
   have some LMN neuromuscular etiology contributing to her respiratory
   failure, possible due to long ICU admission/deconditioning versus
   steroid myopathy per PT and intern exam of LUE.
   - no changes in current vent settings, treat sepsis as above
   - continue current sedation.
   - d/c steroids today.
   - consider neuro consult to assess for steroid myopathy pending
   resolution of current sepsis treatment
   - palliative care involved
   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues
   # GERD: PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU due to ILD flare and failure to extubate. The patient has been intubated for 16 days. She presents with hypotension, tachycardia, fever, leukocytosis, new infiltrates on chest X-ray, low urine output, increasing hypoxia, and altered mental status. The possible causes of these symptoms include sepsis associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), pulmonary embolism (PE), and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's family wishes to continue aggressive treatment while avoiding new lines or pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, new infiltrates on chest X-ray, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status suggest a possible septic state. Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care are crucial to manage sepsis effectively.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the presence of new infiltrates on chest X-ray, the patient may be at risk for developing VAP. Adequate lung hygiene, elevation of the head of bed, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered to prevent and treat VAP.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe interstitial lung disease and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from after failure to extubate; intubated x 16 days.
   # Hypotension and tachycardia: Most likely [**1-16**] sepsis (fever to 101,
   leukocytosis, CXR with new infiltrates at RML, tachycardia) bordering
   on severe sepsis given low U/O (<30 ccs/hr x2 hrs), increasing hypoxia
   on ABG, and altered MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4713**] include auto-PEEP (given
   increase in PEEP yesterday and tachynpea), PE (less likely as had
   sufficient DVT ppx), and adrenal insufficiency given her long steroid
   taper.
   -          Aggressive 1L NS IVF boluses
   -          blood, urine, stool cultures
   -          start Vancomycin/Aztreonam (day 1 [**12-14**])
   -          check lactate
   -          trend fever curve, WBC, and urine output
   -          check random cortisol
   -          EKG to assess for RHS or new RBBB c/f PE
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely [**1-16**] to mild  COPD and flare of severe
   interstitial lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary infection on sputum
   cultures. s/p trach. Unable to wean off FiO2 yesterday on PS, required
   change of VS to PC. Family meeting today, family understands that
   patient prognosis is poor and patient is DNR with no further lines or
   pressors, but they still wish to work towards rehab and chronic vent
   weaning. Patient is quite weak and may have some neuromuscular etiology
   contributing to her respiratory failure, possible due to long ICU
   admission/deconditioning versus steroid myopathy.
   - attempt to change vent settings over to PS prior to going to rehab
   - sedation wean once stable on PS vent settings (fentanyl IV to patch,
   versed to IV ativan or valium)
   - changed solumedrol to PO prednisone 10 mg daily.
   - PT consult
   - possible neuro consult to assess for steroid myopathy
   - palliative care involved
   # NSVT: No further episodes of NSVT once electrolytes repleted.
   - continue telemetry
   - replete lytes mg > 2 k > 4 w/ daily lyes check.
   - patient is currently DNR
   # LUE edema: likely related to A-line. Has been on ppx heparin. No
   evidence of DVT on LUE U/S.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues
   # GERD: PPI

   extubate.
   24 Hour Events:
   - family meeting => family wishes for patient to remain DNR (no further
   lines or pressors if she becomes septic), but wish to work towards
   ventilator weaning and rehabilitation.
   - rpt ABG with pO2 down to 60s (7.48/48/84 => 7.48/45/63) on unchanged

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as
   transfer from after failure to extubate; intubated x 16 days.
   # Hypotension and tachycardia: Most likely [**1-16**] sepsis associated with
   VAP (fever to 101, leukocytosis, CXR with new infiltrates at RML,
   tachycardia) bordering on severe sepsis given low U/O (<30 ccs/hr x2
   hrs), increasing hypoxia on ABG, and acutely altered
   MS/unresponsiveness. Other etiologies include auto-PEEP (given increase
   in PEEP yesterday and tachynpea), PE (less likely as had sufficient DVT
   ppx), and adrenal insufficiency given her long steroid taper.
   -          Aggressive 1L NS IVF boluses
   -          blood, urine, stool, sputum cultures
   -          start Vancomycin/Aztreonam (day 1 [**12-14**])
   -          check lactate
   -          trend fever curve, WBC, and urine output
   -          check random cortisol
   -          EKG to assess for RHS or new RBBB c/f PE
   -          Talked with family to communicate new change in care. HCP
   has agreed with no new lines or pressors, and have agreed with current
   treatment while in the process of communicating with patient
s husband
   new changes in care..
   # Respiratory Failure:  Has severe interstitial lung disease. Evidence
   of sepsis likely associated with VAP, likely reason why patient was
   progressively hypoxic on ABGs yesterday requiring increased FiO2 and
   PEEP yesterday on ventilator settings.. Patient is quite weak and may
   have some LMN neuromuscular etiology contributing to her respiratory
   failure, possible due to long ICU admission/deconditioning versus
   steroid myopathy per PT and intern exam of LUE.
   - no changes in current vent settings, treat sepsis as above
   - continue current sedation.
   - d/c steroids today.
   - consider neuro consult to assess for steroid myopathy pending
   resolution of current sepsis treatment
   - palliative care involved
   # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
   # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD who has been admitted to the ICU due to failure to extubate. She is currently intubated for 16 days. The patient's family wishes to remain DNR and work towards ventilator weaning and rehabilitation. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure with severe interstitial lung disease, sepsis likely associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible LMN neuromuscular etiology contributing to respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension and tachycardia: The patient is showing signs of sepsis, which can lead to severe sepsis if not treated promptly. The low urine output, increasing hypoxia on ABG, and altered mental status are concerning for sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe interstitial lung disease and evidence of sepsis likely associated with VAP. This has led to progressive hypoxia on ABGs requiring increased FiO2 and PEEP on ventilator settings.
3. LMN Neuromuscular Etiology: The patient's flaccid left lower extremity and decreased brachial reflexes suggest a possible LMN derangement, potentially due to steroid myopathy or deconditioning/degeneration from long-term ICU admission.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which needs to be continued with"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as transfer from
   after failure to extubate; intubated x 16 days.
   # Hypotension and tachycardia: Most likely [**1-16**] sepsis associated with
   VAP (fever to 101, leukocytosis, CXR with new infiltrates at RML,
   tachycardia) bordering on severe sepsis given low U/O (<30 ccs/hr x2
   hrs), increasing hypoxia on ABG, and acutely altered
   MS/unresponsiveness. Other etiologies include auto-PEEP (given increase
   in PEEP yesterday and tachynpea), PE (less likely as had sufficient DVT
   ppx), and adrenal insufficiency given her long steroid taper.
   - Aggressive 1L NS IVF boluses
   - blood, urine, stool, sputum cultures
   - start Vancomycin/Aztreonam (day 1 [**12-14**])
   - check lactate
   - trend fever curve, WBC, and urine output
   - check random cortisol
   - EKG to assess for RHS or new RBBB c/f PE
   - Talked with family to communicate new change in care. HCP has agreed
   with no new lines or pressors, and have agreed with current treatment
   while in the process of communicating with patient
s husband new
   changes in care..
   # Respiratory Failure:  Has severe interstitial lung disease. Evidence
   of sepsis likely associated with VAP, likely reason why patient was
   progressively hypoxic on ABGs yesterday requiring increased FiO2 and
   PEEP yesterday on ventilator settings.. Patient is quite weak and may
   have some LMN neuromuscular etiology contributing to her respiratory
   failure, possible due to long ICU admission/deconditioning versus
   steroid myopathy per PT and intern exam of LUE.
   - no changes in current vent settings, treat sepsis as above
   - continue current sedation.
   - d/c steroids today.
   - consider neuro consult to assess for steroid myopathy pending
   resolution of current sepsis treatment
   - palliative care involved
    # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
    # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who presents as a transfer from another facility after failure to extubate, intubated for 16 days. She has several potential medical complications based on her current condition.

1. Hypotension and Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, which could be indicative of sepsis associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This is supported by her fever to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, leukocytosis, and new infiltrates on her chest X-ray at the right middle lobe. Other possible etiologies include auto-PEEP, pulmonary embolism, and adrenal insufficiency.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe interstitial lung disease, and her respiratory failure is likely associated with sepsis due to VAP. She is progressively hypoxic on ABGs, requiring increased FiO2 and PEEP on ventilator settings. There may also be a neuromuscular etiology contributing to her respiratory failure, possibly due to long ICU admission/deconditioning or steroid myopathy.

3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and Synthroid should be continued as part of her management.

4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, but Lipitor cannot be crushed, so it is being held.

5. Osteoporosis: The patient has oste"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as transfer
   after failure to extubate. Thought to have severe ILD with difficult
   vent liberation complicated by HAP starting [**2168-12-14**].
   # Hypotension and tachycardia:
   Most likely secondary to sepsis associated with VAP (fever to 101.5,
   leukocytosis, CXR with new infiltrates at RML, tachycardia) bordering
   on severe sepsis given low U/O (<30 ccs/hr x2 hrs), increasing hypoxia
   on ABG, and acutely altered MS/unresponsiveness. Other etiologies
   include PE (less likely as had sufficient DVT ppx and no evidence of RH
   strain on EKG yesterday to indicate massive PE to explain hypotension),
   and adrenal insufficiency given her long steroid taper and appropriate
   random cortisol of 38 yesterday. Sputum culture from [**2168-12-14**] reveals
   moderate growth of GNR that as as yet unspeciated. C.diff toxin assay
   is negative.
   - Follow-up sputum culture for speciation of GNRs
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Fluid boluses as needed to support blood pressure or UOP
   - Continue Vancomycin/Aztreonam (day 1 [**12-14**]) for 8 day course
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, and urine output
   # Respiratory Failure:
   Has severe interstitial lung disease. Evidence of sepsis likely
   associated with VAP, likely reason why patient was progressively
   hypoxic on and is now requiring FiO2 of 70% (up from 60% earlier in day
   yesterday). Patient is quite weak and may have some LMN neuromuscular
   etiology contributing to her respiratory failure, possible due to long
   ICU admission/deconditioning versus steroid myopathy per PT and intern
   exam of LUE. Patient on short trial of pressure support ventilation
   that resulted in tachypnea, thus patient was switched back to PCV.
   - Treat sepsis as above and keep patient on PCV vent setting and
   liberate as tolerated
   - Continue current sedation.
   - Consider neuro consult to assess for steroid myopathy pending
   resolution of current sepsis treatment

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has severe interstitial lung disease and was transferred after failing to extubate. The patient presented with fever, leukocytosis, new infiltrates on chest X-ray, hypotension, and tachycardia, indicating possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She was started on vancomycin and aztreonam for suspected VAP. Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient remains hypotensive and hypoxic, suggesting the possibility of sepsis or severe sepsis. Other potential causes of hypotension include pulmonary embolism (PE) and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's mental status has also deteriorated, with unresponsiveness. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. worsening respiratory failure due to uncontrolled VAP or progression of underlying interstitial lung disease.
2. progression of sepsis or severe sepsis if the current infection is not adequately treated.
3. development of complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated lung injury or ventilator dependency.
4. potential need for tracheostomy given the patient's long-term mechanical ventilation.
5. risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
6. risk of stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.
7. possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding if stress ulcers progress.
8. need for close monitoring and management of glycemic control.
9. potential complications associated with long-term sedation and neuromuscular blockade.
10. risk of hospital-acquired infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and prompt management of any potential complications to optimize outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presents as transfer from
   after failure to extubate; intubated x 16 days.
   # Hypotension and tachycardia: Most likely [**1-16**] sepsis associated with
   VAP (fever to 101, leukocytosis, CXR with new infiltrates at RML,
   tachycardia) bordering on severe sepsis given low U/O (<30 ccs/hr x2
   hrs), increasing hypoxia on ABG, and acutely altered
   MS/unresponsiveness. Other etiologies include auto-PEEP (given increase
   in PEEP yesterday and tachynpea), PE (less likely as had sufficient DVT
   ppx), and adrenal insufficiency given her long steroid taper.
   - Aggressive 1L NS IVF boluses
   - blood, urine, stool, sputum cultures
   - start Vancomycin/Aztreonam (day 1 [**12-14**])
   - check lactate
   - trend fever curve, WBC, and urine output
   - check random cortisol
   - EKG to assess for RHS or new RBBB c/f PE
   - Talked with family to communicate new change in care. HCP has agreed
   with no new lines or pressors, and have agreed with current treatment
   while in the process of communicating with patient
s husband new
   changes in care..
   # Respiratory Failure:  Has severe interstitial lung disease. Evidence
   of sepsis likely associated with VAP, likely reason why patient was
   progressively hypoxic on ABGs yesterday requiring increased FiO2 and
   PEEP yesterday on ventilator settings.. Patient is quite weak and may
   have some LMN neuromuscular etiology contributing to her respiratory
   failure, possible due to long ICU admission/deconditioning versus
   steroid myopathy per PT and intern exam of LUE.
   - no changes in current vent settings, treat sepsis as above
   - continue current sedation.
   - d/c steroids today.
   - consider neuro consult to assess for steroid myopathy pending
   resolution of current sepsis treatment
   - palliative care involved
    # Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid
    # Hyperlipidemia: unable to crush lipitor, holding.
   # Osteoporosis: hx of compression fractures:  No acute issues
   # GERD: PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU after failure to extubate. She has been intubated for 16 days. The patient presents with hypotension, tachycardia, fever, leukocytosis, new infiltrates on chest X-ray, and altered mental status. These symptoms suggest sepsis associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other possible etiologies include auto-PEEP, pulmonary embolism, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient has been started on aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care. Cultures have been obtained, and additional tests are being done to assess the patient's condition. The patient's respiratory failure is severe interstitial lung disease with evidence of sepsis likely associated with VAP. The patient's weakness may be due to neuromuscular etiology or deconditioning from prolonged ICU admission. Treatment for sepsis and respiratory failure continues as before, with close monitoring and adjustment as necessary. The patient's other medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and GERD, are also being managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, fever, leukocytosis, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a possible septic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a higher FiO2 requirement, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. The presence of a new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the right lower lobe (RLL) further contributes to the respiratory failure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed a new RLL VAP, which requires empirical antimicrobial therapy. This indicates an active infectious process in the lungs.

3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has advanced ILD/pulmonary fibrosis and COPD as underlying conditions, contributing to their respiratory failure.

4. Pain control: The patient requires major focus on pain management, suggesting the presence of significant pain or discomfort.

5. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The patient has been treated for ILD, specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Poor response to high-dose steroids and the presence of pulmonary fibrosis indicate ongoing ILD.

6. Hypotension: The patient experienced resolved hypotension that was addressed with a fluid challenge.

7. General weakness: The patient is experiencing critical care myopathy and steroid-induced weakness, along with deconditioning.

8. Nutritional support: The patient requires nutritional support through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of advanced interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent pneumonia. He remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and is on high FIO2 support and PCV mode. The patient's condition has declined over the last six days, with new-onset right lower lobe pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP) and increased FiO2 requirement. He also has hypotension, general weakness, and poor nutritional status. The patient's pain control is a major focus of care, and he has a poor prognosis due to ILD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's advanced ILD/pulmonary fibrosis and COPD, along with the recent development of VAP, have resulted in respiratory failure. Continued mechanical ventilation dependence is indicated.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed new right lower lobe pneumonia, which may require empirical antimicrobials.
3. Pain Control: Given the patient's critical care myopathy and the need for pain management, this will be a major focus of care.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced resolved hypotension that was managed with a fluid challenge.
5. General Weakness: The patient's general weakness can be attributed to critical care myopathy, steroids, and deconditioning.
6. Nutritional Support: The patient requires"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial; new VAP (RLL), on background of
   advanced ILD/pulmonary fibrosis.  Now with higher FiO2 requirement.
   PAIN CONTROL -- major focus of care
   Resp failure
acute on chronic
   ILD (IPF, less likely NSIP given poor response to high dose steroids,
   continuing steroid taper, s/p treatment for pna and diuresis for pulm
   edema component)
   New hypotension
   fever/leukocytosis
   pna on cxr/secretions
   COPD (without acute exac)
   Anemia (stable)
   Weakness (deconditioning, ? Steroid related)
   Pt with advanced interstitial lung ds. Continues to require full
   ventilator support. Prognosis to wean from vent is very poor. Now with
   sirs/septic presentiation with new leukocytosis/fever/hypotension from
   presumed VAP.   Agree with plan to pan cx.  Cover for
   VAP-->vanco/aztreonam.  DDX includes PE as well, though much lower
   clincial suspicion of this given fever, wbc ct, secretions and
   infiltrate. Has been on DVT prophylaxis.  Will give aggressive IVFs.
   Update family as to further decline in clinical status.  Continue mdis
   and continue current prednisone dose.  Given this new infection concern
   for adrenal insuff contributing to hypotension--will check random
   cortisol level and consider stress dose. Weakness /l arm faclid is
   another issue and --may be [**1-16**] deconditioning--steroid
   myopathy/critical care myopathy of concern.  At this time acute issues
   more pressing and pt is too unstable for CT scan. Will update family
   and readdress pending furtehr improvement. Palliative care following.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to advanced interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary fibrosis. They require full ventilator support and have a poor prognosis for weaning off the ventilator.

2. The patient presents with new-onset fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, indicating a possible severe sepsis or septic shock secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started to cover for VAP.

3. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, weakness (possibly due to deconditioning or steroid-related), and advanced ILD.

4. The patient is on various medications, including sedatives (Midazolam), pain management medications (Fentanyl), heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, and a continuous infusion of Nutren Pulmonary for nutrition.

5. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate between 95-110 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/70 to 129/114 mmHg, respiratory rate between 18-31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and sinus rhythm.

6. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds, no signs"
