","The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes mellitus (DM) who presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after missing approximately 24 hours of insulin. Her initial blood glucose level was 164 mg/dL, which has decreased to 65 mg/dL. She has received IV fluids and insulin infusions, and her acid-base balance is improving. However, she still has a mild metabolic acidosis with a gap of 12. There are no signs of infection or ischemic events. 

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 91/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.4 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 41.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 421 K/uL, blood glucose level of 65 mg/dL, sodium (Na) level of 138 mEq/L, potassium (K) level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride (Cl) level of 107 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 19 mEq/L, BUN level of 41.8 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, and calcium (Ca++) level of 8.9 mg/dL. 

The patient has been transitioned from insulin gtt to subcutaneous insulin (NPH 64 qam & 34 qpm home dosing) and will continue IV fluids and electrolyte repletion. Further blood and throat cultures are planned. She will need an outpatient appointment with her primary diabetologist before discharge. 

The patient's medical team is considering repeating urine tests for ketones and further workup for renal tubular acidosis (RTA) if her metabolic acidosis does not resolve. She will be ambulated to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's mother will be contacted for any significant medical decisions due to the patient's lack of decision-making capacity. The patient's code status is full code, and she is likely to be transferred to the medical floor in the afternoon."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 19-year-old woman with type I diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to approximately 24 hours of missed insulin. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. 

Key findings from the note include:
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 91/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
- The patient is receiving insulin via a peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC line) and has been transitioned from subcutaneous insulin.
- The patient has received IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as part of her treatment.
- Blood and throat cultures have been obtained to identify any potential infection.
- The patient's laboratory values indicate a WBC count of 13.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.4 g/dL, blood glucose of 115 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, and bicarbonate level of 19 mEq/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   19 yo woman with diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to medication
   noncompliance. Gap closed but remains hypovolemic (versus autonomic
   instability from long standing diabetes)
   -If she eats bfast, we will transition to home regimen of insulin,
   advance diet, overlap drip with SC NPH for at least one hour, then shut
   off insuling drip and follow finger sticks closely.
   - Have [**Last Name (un) 303**] see patient
   - Try another liter LR for volume resuscitation - as she is still tachy
   with postural changes. But making adequate urine so may be an issue of
   autonomic instability -

","Summary:
The patient is a 19-year-old woman with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to medication noncompliance. She has received fluids and insulin, and her blood glucose levels have improved. However, she remains hypovolemic and tachycardic. The plan is to transition her to a home regimen of insulin, advance her diet, and overlap the insulin drip with subcutaneous NPH for at least one hour before shutting off the insulin drip. The patient will be closely monitored with finger sticks. She is also experiencing autonomic instability, which may be related to her long-standing diabetes. Another liter of normal saline will be given for volume resuscitation. The patient has a history of poorly controlled diabetes and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: After stopping the insulin drip, there is a risk of hypoglycemia, especially if the patient does not eat breakfast as planned.
2. Volume depletion: Despite receiving fluids, the patient remains hypovolemic, indicating ongoing fluid losses or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Autonomic instability: The patient's persistent tachycardia and orthostatic changes suggest ongoing issues with autonomic regulation, possibly due to her long-standing diabetes.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, particularly in the lower extremities.
5. Nosocomial infection"
