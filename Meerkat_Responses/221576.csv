 LEUKOCYTOSIS
   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis who presented with
   ruptured spleen and underwent splenectomy who then returned to the OR
   for repair of an enteric leak, now transferred to the ICU in the
   setting of respiratory distress and massive pleural effusion.
   # Tachypnea and Pleural effusion:
   Unclear if imaging is misleading as patient was in semi-erect position,
   which may have caused fluid to move superiorly on film.
   - obtain repeat CXR in erect position to confirm size of effusion
   - although surgery did not want to re-tap effusion, would favor
   thoracentesis +/- pigtail catheter placement as fluid is likely to be
   infected given probable communication with LUQ fluid collection
   - pt currently oxygenating very well and not showing signs of tiring,
   likely because he has excellent respiratory reserve given young age.
   will monitor closely
   - follow ABGs, particularly given that high dose narcotics may blunt
   his tachypnea
   # Sinus Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE, tachypnea/respiratory
   distress, and infection.
   - would avoid beta blocking sinus tachycardia and rather would treat
   underlying causes
   # s/p repair of enteric leak:
   - continue NG tube to intermittent suction
   - continue cipro/flagyl
   - appreciate surgery input
   - f/u peritoneal fluid culture
   - obtain BCx
   # GPCs from CVL blood Cx [**5-8**]:
   - will need his line re-sited
   - continue vanc for now
   # Pain:
   - continue dilaudid PCA and consider increasing dose if his pain does
   not improve
   - bowel regimen while on narcotics once he is taking PO meds
   # Recent Splenectomy:
   - will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   # Subsegmental PEs:
   - hold on heparin gtt during acute post-op period
   - discuss with surgery re: timing of restarting heparin gtt
   # Leukocytosis:
   Likely from enteric leak, recent surgery, and GPCs in blood.
   - f/u culture data
   - address sources of infection as discussed above
   # Elevated platelets:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be inflammatory reaction, but elevation of platelets is extremely
   pronounced.
   - monitor
   # Anemia, Hct stable at 31:
   Note that patient's haptoglobin was less than assay on admission labs
   [**5-1**].
   - send hemolysis work-up
   - active type and screen
   # Delirium:
   Patient has self-extubated earlier during his hospital course.  Per
   surgery, his NG tube needs to continue to suction for decompression of
   his bowel.
   - appreciate psych recs
   - frequent reorientation
   - haldol PRN
   - EKG to monitor QTc
   - restraints to avoid pulling at tubes/lines
   # Recurrent pancreatitis:
   Unclear cause, although would consider cystic fibrosis given family
   history.
   - recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical exam
   # FEN:  strict NPO including for meds; LR continuous at 125 with

 LEUKOCYTOSIS
   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis who presented with
   ruptured spleen and underwent splenectomy who then returned to the OR
   for repair of an enteric leak, now transferred to the ICU in the
   setting of respiratory distress and massive pleural effusion.
   # Tachypnea and Pleural effusion: Pt sating well on 5 L nasal canula.
   CT yesterday showed significant L sided plural effusion.
   This effusion appears to have been present since before the surgery and
   the patient is not in respiratory distress.  Plan to hold on tap for
   now, however will re-consider if patients respiratory status
   deteriorates or he shows worsening signs of infecion.
   -continue O2 by nasal cannula
   -monitor ABGs
   - taper narcotics
   #Anemia : no evidence of bleed as patient has not had any bloody BMs or
   emesis.  Pt also states that his abdomen is less distended and
   clinically he does not have any evidence of bleeding from his surgical
   site or into his abdomen.  While this changes is most likely dilution
   in the context of recent fluid resusitation, we remain concerned for GI
   bleed or bleed into the abdomen from his surgical site.  Normal
   haptoglobin and unconjugated bilirubin suggest that it is not
   hemolytic, and marrow is responding appropriately with increased retic
   ct.
   -closely follow hematocrit
   -type and screen 3 units
   # coag negative staph : pt with one cx coag negative staph.  Will
   continue to cx until negative.
   -serial cxs
   -replace lines if bacteremia persists
   -continue vancomycin
   # s/p repair of enteric leak : pt now with GNR isolated in peritoneal
   fluid and abcess growing haemophilus.
   - continue NG tube to intermittent suction
   - continue cipro/flagyl
   - appreciate surgery input
   # Sinus Tachycardia:Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE,
   tachypnea/respiratory distress, and infection.  Persisting despite
   fluid resusitation, however expect continued improvement with treatment
   of infection.  Will hold of on BBlocker for now and attempt to tx
   underlying cause.
   # Pain:  Well controlled on dilaudid PCA.  Req
d one dose of IV
   dilaudid for break through pain
   - wean to orals today
   -IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain
   - bowel regimen while on narcotics once he is taking PO meds
   # Recent Splenectomy:
   - will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   # Subsegmental PEs:
   - hold on heparin gtt during acute post-op period
   - discuss with surgery re: timing of restarting heparin gtt
   # Leukocytosis:
   Likely from enteric leak, recent surgery, and GPCs in blood.
   - f/u culture data
   - address sources of infection as discussed above
   # Elevated platelets: Trending down, likely acute inflammatory
   response.
   -continue to follow.
   # Delirium: Improved.  Pt oriented, has not attemped to pull tubes
   while in ICU.  Ekg performed for haldol monitoring was normal.
   - appreciate psych recs
   - frequent reorientation
   - haldol PRN
   - restraints as needed o avoid pulling at tubes/lines
   # Recurrent pancreatitis:
   Unclear cause, although would consider cystic fibrosis given family
   history.
   - recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical exam
   # FEN:  strict NPO including for meds; LR continuous at 125 with
   boluses PRN; note that pt has feeding J tube, but unclear indication at
   present

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis who presented with a ruptured spleen and underwent splenectomy. He then returned to the operating room for repair of an enteric leak. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress and massive pleural effusion. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. The patient has a significant left-sided pleural effusion, which appears to have been present before surgery. There are no signs of respiratory distress at the moment, so the plan is to hold off on tapping the effusion for now.
2. The patient's anemia is likely due to dilution as a result of recent fluid resuscitation. However, there is concern for gastrointestinal bleeding or bleeding into the abdomen from the surgical site. Further evaluation is needed.
3. The patient has a coag-negative staph infection, so serial cultures will be done, and the lines will be replaced if bacteremia persists.
4. The patient also has a gram-negative rod isolated in the peritoneal fluid and an abscess growing Haemophilus. The treatment plan includes continuing the NG tube to intermittent suction, continuing cipro/flagyl, and getting surgical input.
5. The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, likely multifactorial in nature due to pain, pulmonary embolism, respiratory distress, and infection. It is expected to improve with treatment of infection.

 LEUKOCYTOSIS
   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis who presented with
   ruptured spleen and underwent splenectomy who then returned to the OR
   for repair of an enteric leak, now transferred to the ICU in the
   setting of respiratory distress and massive pleural effusion.
   # Tachypnea and Pleural effusion: Pt sating well on 5 L nasal canula.
   CT yesterday showed significant L sided plural effusion.
   This effusion appears to have been present since before the surgery and
   the patient is not in respiratory distress.  Plan to hold on tap for
   now, however will re-consider if patients respiratory status
   deteriorates or he shows worsening signs of infecion.
   -continue O2 by nasal cannula
   -monitor ABGs
   - taper narcotics
   #Anemia : no evidence of bleed as patient has not had any bloody BMs or
   emesis.  Pt also states that his abdomen is less distended and
   clinically he does not have any evidence of bleeding from his surgical
   site or into his abdomen.  While this changes is most likely dilution
   in the context of recent fluid resusitation, we remain concerned for GI
   bleed or bleed into the abdomen from his surgical site.  Normal
   haptoglobin and unconjugated bilirubin suggest that it is not
   hemolytic, and marrow is responding appropriately with increased retic
   ct.
   -closely follow hematocrit
   -type and screen 3 units
   # coag negative staph : pt with one cx coag negative staph.  Will
   continue to cx until negative.
   -serial cxs
   -replace lines if bacteremia persists
   -continue vancomycin
   # s/p repair of enteric leak : pt now with GNR isolated in peritoneal
   fluid and abcess growing haemophilus.
   - continue NG tube to intermittent suction
   - continue cipro/flagyl
   - appreciate surgery input
   # Sinus Tachycardia:Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE,
   tachypnea/respiratory distress, and infection.  Persisting despite
   fluid resusitation, however expect continued improvement with treatment
   of infection.  Will hold of on BBlocker for now and attempt to tx
   underlying cause.
   # Pain:  Well controlled on dilaudid PCA.  Req
d one dose of IV
   dilaudid for break through pain
   - wean to orals today
   -IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain
   - bowel regimen while on narcotics once he is taking PO meds
   # Recent Splenectomy:
   - will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   # Subsegmental PEs:
   - hold on heparin gtt during acute post-op period
   - discuss with surgery re: timing of restarting heparin gtt
   # Leukocytosis:
   Likely from enteric leak, recent surgery, and GPCs in blood.
   - f/u culture data
   - address sources of infection as discussed above
   # Elevated platelets: Trending down, likely acute inflammatory
   response.
   -continue to follow.
   # Anemia, Hct stable at 31:
   Note that patient's haptoglobin was less than assay on admission labs
   [**5-1**].
   - send hemolysis work-up
   - active type and screen
   # Delirium:
   Patient has self-extubated earlier during his hospital course.  Per
   surgery, his NG tube needs to continue to suction for decompression of
   his bowel.
   - appreciate psych recs
   - frequent reorientation
   - haldol PRN
   - EKG to monitor [**Month/Year (2) 818**]
   - restraints to avoid pulling at tubes/lines
   # Recurrent pancreatitis:
   Unclear cause, although would consider cystic fibrosis given family
   history.
   - recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical exam
   # FEN:  strict NPO including for meds; LR continuous at 125 with
   boluses PRN; note that pt has feeding J tube, but unclear indication at
   present
   # PPx:  subQ heparin; continue IV PPI started on floor
   # Access:  20g PIV, left IJ (will need to be re-sited)

 LEUKOCYTOSIS
   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis who presented with
   ruptured spleen and underwent splenectomy who then returned to the OR
   for repair of an enteric leak, now transferred to the ICU in the
   setting of respiratory distress and massive pleural effusion.
   # Tachypnea and Pleural effusion: Pt sating well on 5 L nasal canula.
   CT yesterday showed significant L sided plural effusion.
   This effusion appears to have been present since before the surgery and
   the patient is not in respiratory distress.  Plan to hold on tap for
   now, however will re-consider if patients respiratory status
   deteriorates or he shows worsening signs of infecion.
   -continue O2 by nasal cannula
   -monitor ABGs
   - taper narcotics
   #Anemia : no evidence of bleed as patient has not had any bloody BMs or
   emesis.  Pt also states that his abdomen is less distended and
   clinically he does not have any evidence of bleeding from his surgical
   site or into his abdomen.  While this changes is most likely dilution
   in the context of recent fluid resusitation, we remain concerned for GI
   bleed or bleed into the abdomen from his surgical site.  Normal
   haptoglobin and unconjugated bilirubin suggest that it is not
   hemolytic, and marrow is responding appropriately with increased retic
   ct.
   -closely follow hematocrit
   -type and screen 3 units
   # coag negative staph : pt with one cx coag negative staph.  Will
   continue to cx until negative.
   -serial cxs
   -replace lines if bacteremia persists
   -continue vancomycin
   # s/p repair of enteric leak : pt now with GNR isolated in peritoneal
   fluid and abcess growing haemophilus.
   - continue NG tube to intermittent suction
   - continue cipro/flagyl
   - appreciate surgery input
   # Sinus Tachycardia:Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE,
   tachypnea/respiratory distress, and infection.  Persisting despite
   fluid resusitation, however expect continued improvement with treatment
   of infection.  Will hold of on BBlocker for now and attempt to tx
   underlying cause.
   # Pain:  Well controlled on dilaudid PCA.  Req
d one dose of IV
   dilaudid for break through pain
   - wean to orals today
   -IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain
   - bowel regimen while on narcotics once he is taking PO meds
   # Recent Splenectomy:
   - will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   # Subsegmental PEs:
   - hold on heparin gtt during acute post-op period
   - discuss with surgery re: timing of restarting heparin gtt
   # Leukocytosis:
   Likely from enteric leak, recent surgery, and GPCs in blood.
   - f/u culture data
   - address sources of infection as discussed above
   # Elevated platelets: Trending down, likely acute inflammatory
   response.
   -continue to follow.
   # Delirium: Improved.  Pt oriented, has not attemped to pull tubes
   while in ICU.  Ekg performed for haldol monitoring was normal.
   - appreciate psych recs
   - frequent reorientation
   - haldol PRN
   - restraints as needed o avoid pulling at tubes/lines
   # Recurrent pancreatitis:
   Unclear cause, although would consider cystic fibrosis given family
   history.
   - recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical exam
   # FEN:  strict NPO including for meds; LR continuous at 125 with
   boluses PRN; note that pt has feeding J tube, but unclear indication at
   present
   # PPx:  subQ heparin; continue IV PPI started on floor
   # Access:  20g PIV, left IJ (will need to be re-sited)

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis who underwent splenectomy and repair of an enteric leak. He presented with respiratory distress and a massive pleural effusion, which appears to have been present before surgery. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea and Pleural Effusion: The patient has a significant left-sided pleural effusion, which could cause respiratory distress if not properly managed. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABGs is recommended.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have decreased, possibly due to dilution from recent fluid resuscitation. Close follow-up of hematocrit levels and consideration for blood transfusion if necessary.
3. Coag-Negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient has grown coag-negative staphylococcus in blood cultures. Serial cultures will be done to ensure negative results, and replacement of lines if bacteremia persists.
4. Intra-abdominal Abscess: The patient has an intra-abdominal abscess growing Haemophilus. Continuous NG tube to intermittent suction and continuation of antibiotics are planned.
5. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, likely due to pain, PE, tachypnea, respiratory distress, and infection. Holding off on beta-blockers for now and addressing the underlying causes of tachyc"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis. He presented with a ruptured spleen and underwent splenectomy. Subsequently, he returned to the operating room for repair of an enteric leak.

2. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress and massive pleural effusion. The effusion appears to have been present before the surgery, and the patient is not currently in respiratory distress.

3. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F), blood pressure of 140/75 mmHg, heart rate of 108 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

4. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, which is likely multifactorial due to pain, pulmonary embolism (PE), respiratory distress, and infection. The tachycardia persists despite fluid resuscitation.

5. The patient's pain is well-controlled on dilaudid PCA, but he required one dose of IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain. The plan is to wean him to oral pain medications today.

6. The patient has leukocytosis, likely from the enteric leak, recent surgery, and gastrointestinal procedures in his blood. The source of infection needs to be addressed.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yomh/o recurrent pancreatitis, recent surgery for splenectomy,
   enteric leak now with post-operative respiratory distress.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Much improved.  Multifactorial.  Suspect
   contribution of bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion,
   left atalectasis, pulmonary emboli (off anticoagulation), and abdominal
   pain.  Plan treat sepsis, antibiotics, iv fliuds, optimize pain
   management, maintain upright position.  Consider left thoracentesis if
   expands.
   TACHYCARDIA
 likley reflects respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia,
   possible pulmonary embolism.  Monitor HR, check EKG.  Replete iv fluid,
   optimize pain, treat sepsis/bacteremia.
   BACTEREMIA
 GPC, possible line related, but concern for enteric
   infection.  Remove central lines if possible (use peripheral if
   feasible).  Continue Vanco.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI
 left, subsegmental, multiple.  Resumed
   anticoagulation as per Surgery --> monitor PTT 60-80
   PLEURAL EFFUSION
 suspect sympathetic and related to abdominal
   surgeries.
   s/p ENTERIC LEAK --  NGT with intermittent suction, antibiotics, await
   culture results.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT
 post-op.  PCA pump, optimize dosing.
    s/p SPLENECTOMY -- will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   FLIUD
 desire net volume expension.
   THROMBOCYTOSIS
 perhaps reactive.  Monitor.
   DELERIUM
 resolved.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Continue TPN.
   RECURRENT PANCREATITS -- Unclear cause, but consider cystic fibrosis
   given family history.  Recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical
   exam.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yomh/o recurrent pancreatitis, recent surgery for splenectomy,
   enteric leak now with post-operative respiratory distress.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Much improved.  Multifactorial.  Suspect
   contribution of bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion,
   left atalectasis, pulmonary emboli (off anticoagulation), and abdominal
   pain.  Plan treat sepsis, antibiotics, iv fliuds, optimize pain
   management, maintain upright position.  Consider left thoracentesis if
   expands.
   TACHYCARDIA
 likley reflects respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia,
   possible pulmonary embolism.  Monitor HR, check EKG.  Replete iv fluid,
   optimize pain, treat sepsis/bacteremia.
   BACTEREMIA
 GPC, possible line related, but concern for enteric
   infection.  Remove central lines if possible (use peripheral if
   feasible).  Empirical antimicrobials, including Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI
 left, subsegmental, multiple.  Resumed
   anticoagulation as per Surgery --> monitor PTT 60-80
   PLEURAL EFFUSION
 suspect sympathetic and related to abdominal
   surgeries.
   s/p ENTERIC LEAK --  NGT with intermittent suction, antibiotics, await
   culture results.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT
 post-op.  PCA pump, optimize dosing.
    s/p SPLENECTOMY -- will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   FLIUD
 desire net volume expension.
   THROMBOCYTOSIS
 perhaps reactive.  Monitor.
   DELERIUM
 resolved.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Continue TPN.
   RECURRENT PANCREATITS -- Unclear cause, but consider cystic fibrosis
   given family history.  Recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical
   exam.

   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis s/p splenectomy for
   ruptured spleen who returns to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with fevers and tachycardia in
   the setting of recent enteric leak repair.
   # Fevers and Leukocytosis:
   Patient now has [**Female First Name (un) 474**] and non-influenza Hemophilus growing in the
   cultures from his recent abdominal surgery.  He also had coag negative
   staph growing from his PICC line from [**5-8**].  The line has since been
   removed.  Other possible sources for infection include empyema
   (although thoracentesis on [**5-7**] did not show evidence of organisms),
   pancreatitis (lipase slightly increasing), or pneumonia.
   - start fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 474**] coverage
   - [**Female First Name (un) 474**] should grow from blood cultures, but will send fungal blood
   cultures as well
   - start cefepime for broad gram negative and anaerobic coverage (has
   penicillin allergy)
   - continue vancomycin and cipro for now; if he does well clinically,
   would favor stopping cipro and then treating with short course of vanc
   for 5 days after PICC line was pulled ([**Date range (1) 7353**])
   - f/u sensitivities and [**5-9**] cultures
   - will discuss possibility of thoracentesis with surgery if he
   continues to be febrile despite appropriate antibiotics
   # Delirium:
   This may be secondary to his pain medications or could be a
   manifestation of severe infection +/- sepsis.  If he is bacteremic or
   fungemic, would also consider the possibility of septic emboli, but not
   at threshold to image head without supportive culture data.
   - consider pain consult in AM to help with pain management
   - per prior psych recs, can use haldol if patient becomes agitated
   - if haldol is given, would check QTc
   - no hypercarbia on ABG
   # Anemia, Hct 30-31 on admission, currently 23.7:
   Note that patient has been on a heparin gtt, although he was only
   supratherapeutic on one measure post-op on the 26th.
   - follow serial Hcts
   - active type and screen
   - if pt's Hct is dropping, would have low threshold to obtain CT
   abdomen to evaluate for hematoma
   # Tachypnea with respiratory alkalosis:
   Likely related to pain, although he may also have some anxiety from
   being disoriented.
   - continue dilaudid for now but consider pain consult as above
   # Sinus Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE, tachypnea/respiratory
   distress, and infection.
   - would avoid beta blocking sinus tachycardia and rather would treat
   underlying causes
   # Recent Splenectomy:
   - will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   - note that pt is infected with encapsulated organism
   # Subsegmental PEs:
   - continue heparin gtt
   # Elevated platelets:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be inflammatory reaction, but elevation of platelets is extremely
   pronounced.
   - monitor
   # Recurrent pancreatitis:
   Unclear cause, although would consider cystic fibrosis given family
   history.
   - recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical exam
   # FEN:  strict NPO including for meds; LR boluses PRN; restart TPN once
   he has central access
   # PPx:  heparin gtt; continue IV PPI started by surgical team
   # Access:  PIV x 2; per surgery, will need CVL

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis and splenectomy who is currently admitted to the ICU for fevers and tachycardia following an enteric leak repair. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications, including delirium, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pleural effusion, bacteremia, pain control, and pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental state and minimal responsiveness may indicate delirium. It could be secondary to severe infection, sepsis, or pain medications.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's abnormal lab results, such as low potassium, high sodium, and low albumin, suggest an electrolyte and fluid disorder. This could be due to various factors like dehydration, fluid resuscitation, or kidney dysfunction.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient's acute pleural effusion may require further evaluation and management. Thoracentesis may be considered if the effusion does not improve with appropriate antibiotics.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has been found to have bacteremia caused by non-influenza Hemophilus and coag-negative staphylococcus from his recent abdominal surgery and PICC line, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
5. Pain Control: The patient requires effective pain"

   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis s/p splenectomy for
   ruptured spleen who returns to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with fevers and tachycardia in
   the setting of recent enteric leak repair.
   # Fevers and Leukocytosis:
   Patient now has [**Female First Name (un) 474**] and non-influenza Hemophilus growing in the
   cultures from his recent abdominal surgery.  He also had coag negative
   staph growing from his PICC line from [**5-8**].  The line has since been
   removed.  Other possible sources for infection include empyema
   (although thoracentesis on [**5-7**] did not show evidence of organisms),
   pancreatitis (lipase slightly increasing), or pneumonia.
   - start fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 474**] coverage
   - start cefepime for broad gram negative and anaerobic coverage (has
   penicillin allergy)
   - continue vancomycin and cipro
   - f/u sensitivities , bcx, fungal cx, c. diff
   - will discuss possibility of thoracentesis with surgery if he
   continues to be febrile despite appropriate antibiotics
   - CT abdomen and pelvis with possible IR drainage today.
   # Delirium:
   This may be secondary to his pain medications or could be a
   manifestation of severe infection +/- sepsis.  If he is bacteremic or
   fungemic, would also consider the possibility of septic emboli, but not
   at threshold to image head without supportive culture data.
   - pain not well controlled, increase dilaudid to .25 mg IV q 2 hours.
   - haldol prn, per psych recs in chart
confirm QTc prior to dosing
   - ABG without hypercarbia
   # Anemia, Hct 30-31 on admission, currently 23.7, concerning for
   possible bleed considering heparin gtt
 one supratherapeutic measure
   on [**5-11**].
   - follow serial Hcts
   - active type and screen
   - If Hct drops less than current 23.7, contact surgery immediately for
   discussion re: transfusion.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for bleed.
   # Tachypnea with respiratory alkalosis:
   Likely related to pain, although he may also have some anxiety from
   being disoriented.
   - improve control, consider pain cosult.
   # Sinus Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE, tachypnea/respiratory
   distress, and infection.
   - would avoid beta blocking sinus tachycardia and rather would treat
   underlying causes
   # Recent Splenectomy:
   - will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   - note that pt is infected with encapsulated organism
   # Subsegmental PEs:
   - stop heparin gtt per surgery today for CT Abdomen/Pelvis and possible
   IR intervention
   # Elevated platelets:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be inflammatory reaction, but elevation of platelets is extremely
   pronounced.
   - consult heme
   - monitor
   # Recurrent pancreatitis:
   Unclear cause, although would consider cystic fibrosis given family
   history.
   - recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical exam

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis who underwent a splenectomy for a ruptured spleen. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and leukocytosis after recent enteric leak repair. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by non-influenza Hemophilus and coag-negative staph growing from cultures. Additionally, the patient had a PICC line infection, which has been removed.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. These imbalances can lead to various complications such as muscle weakness, abnormal heart rhythms, and kidney dysfunction.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing fluctuations in mental state, possibly due to severe infection or sepsis. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, respiratory complications, and pressure ulcers.

3. Pleural Effusion, Acute: The patient has decreased breath sounds over the anterior left lower lung fields, indicating a possible pleural effusion. If left untreated, this can lead to respiratory distress and potential pneumonia.

4. Tachycardia, Other: The patient has sinus tachycardia, likely caused by multiple factors including pain, pulmonary embolism, tachypnea, and infection. Uncontrolled tachycardia may increase the"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yomh/o recurrent pancreatitis, recent surgery for splenectomy,
   enteric leak now with post-operative respiratory distress and delerium
   (recurrent).
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Much improved.  Multifactorial.  Suspect
   contribution of bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion,
   left atalectasis, pulmonary emboli (off anticoagulation), and abdominal
   pain (splinting).  Plan treat sepsis, antibiotics, iv fliuds, optimize
   pain management, maintain upright position.  Consider left
   thoracentesis if expands.
   TACHYCARDIA
 likley reflects respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia,
   possible pulmonary embolism.  Monitor HR, check EKG.  Replete iv fluid,
   optimize pain, treat sepsis/bacteremia.
   SEPSIS -- evidence for line-related infection and now suspect
   peritoneal source.  For Abd CT imaging to assess for collection.
   Continue Cipro, Cefopime, Vanco, Fluconozole.
   BACTEREMIA
 GPC, possible line related, but concern for enteric
   infection.  Remove central lines if possible (use peripheral if
   feasible).  Continue Vanco.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI
 left, subsegmental, multiple.  Continue
   anticoagulation  --> monitor PTT 60-80.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION
 suspect sympathetic and related to abdominal
   surgeries.  Doubt empyema, but consider diagnostic thoracentesis.
   Monitor.
   s/p ENTERIC LEAK --  NGT with intermittent suction, antibiotics, await
   culture results.  For Abd CT today.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT
 post-op.  s/p PCA pump --> need to optimize dosing
   and interval.
    s/p SPLENECTOMY -- will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   FLUID
 desire net volume expension.
   THROMBOCYTOSIS
 perhaps reactive.  ? reactive.  [**Month (only) 8**] be contributing to
   clotting (pulmonary emboli, clot on PICC line) as value exceeds 1
   million.  Monitor.  Hematology consult.
   DELERIUM
 recurrent.  Possible related to medications and contribution
   of sepsis (toxic-metabolic).  Improved this AM.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Trophic TF.  Resume TPN once central
   access established.
   RECURRENT PANCREATITS -- Unclear cause, but consider cystic fibrosis
   given family history.  Recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical
   exam.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of recurrent pancreatitis and recent surgery for splenectomy.
- The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress, which has improved but is multifactorial in nature.
- The possible contributors to the respiratory distress include bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion, left atelectasis, pulmonary emboli, and abdominal pain (splinting).
- The plan is to treat sepsis with antibiotics and IV fluids, optimize pain management, maintain an upright position, and consider left thoracentesis if the pleural effusion expands.
- The patient has tachycardia, which likely reflects respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia, possible pulmonary embolism, and is being monitored along with EKG checks.
- The patient is also suspected of having sepsis with evidence of line-related infection and a possible peritoneal source.
- For abdominal CT imaging to assess for collections and continue Cipro, Cefopime, Vanco, and Fluconazole.
- There is a concern for bacteremia, especially with possible enteric infection, and central lines are being removed if possible.
- The patient is on anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary emboli and monitoring PTT 60-80.
- There is a suspicion of pleural effusion, likely sympathetic and related to abdominal surgeries.
- Pain management is being optimized, and PCA pump dosing and"

   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis s/p splenectomy for
   ruptured spleen who returns to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with fevers, AMS, tachycardia
   in the setting of recent enteric leak repair.
   # Fevers and Leukocytosis:
   Patient now has [**Female First Name (un) 474**] and non-influenza Hemophilus growing in the
   cultures from his recent abdominal surgery.  He also had coag negative
   staph growing from his PICC line from [**5-8**].  The line has since been
   removed.  Other possible sources for infection include empyema
   (although thoracentesis on [**5-7**] did not show evidence of organisms),
   pancreatitis (lipase slightly increasing), pneumonia, or abd fluid
   collection.
   - continue fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans coverage
   - continue cefepime for broad gram negative and anaerobic coverage (has
   penicillin allergy)
   - continue vancomycin and cipro
   - f/u sensitivities , bcx, fungal cx, c. diff
   - IR drainage today of abdominal and pleural fluid collections
   # Delirium:
   This may be secondary to his pain medications or could be a
   manifestation of severe infection +/- sepsis.  If he is bacteremic or
   fungemic, would also consider the possibility of septic emboli, but not
   at threshold to image head without supportive culture data.
   - pain not well controlled, restart dilaudid PCA
   - haldol prn, per psych recs in chart
confirm QTc prior to dosing
   # Anemia: Stable, however will follow closely given his recent surgery
   and anticoagulation.
   - follow serial Hcts
   - active type and screen
   - If Hct drops less than current 23.7, contact surgery immediately for
   discussion re: transfusion.
   # Tachypnea with respiratory alkalosis: improved since initial ICU
   stay.  Likely related to pain, although he may also have some anxiety
   from being disoriented.
   - continue pain control
   # Sinus Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE, tachypnea/respiratory
   distress, and infection.  Improved since initial infection
   - would avoid beta blocking sinus tachycardia and rather would treat
   underlying causes
   # Recent Splenectomy:
   - will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   - note that pt is infected with encapsulated organism
   # Subsegmental PEs:
   - restart heparin drip today
   # Elevated platelets:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be inflammatory reaction, but elevation of platelets is extremely
   pronounced.
   - consult heme
   - monitor
   # Recurrent pancreatitis:
   Unclear cause, although would consider cystic fibrosis given family
   history.
   - recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical exam

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis and a recent splenectomy.
- He was admitted to the ICU with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and tachycardia.
- The patient underwent enteric leak repair and now presents with multiple medical complications.
- He has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Hemophilus influenzae and coag-negative Staphylococcus from his recent abdominal surgery.
- Other possible sources of infection include empyema, pancreatitis, pneumonia, or an abdominal fluid collection.
- The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics for broad coverage, including fluconazole for fungal coverage.
- He has a pleural effusion and abdominal fluid collection that will be drained today.
- The patient is experiencing delirium, likely secondary to pain medications or severe infection.
- His pain is not well-controlled, so restarting dilaudid PCA has been considered.
- The patient has stable anemia, but it will be closely monitored due to recent surgery and anticoagulation.
- His tachypnea with respiratory alkalosis has improved since the initial ICU stay.
- The patient has sinus tachycardia, which is multifactorial and may be related to pain, PE, tachypnea/respiratory distress, and infection.
- Recent splenectomy is noted, and the patient should receive meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines.

   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis s/p splenectomy for
   ruptured spleen who returns to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with fevers and tachycardia in
   the setting of recent enteric leak repair.
   # Fevers and Leukocytosis:
   Patient now has [**Female First Name (un) 474**] and non-influenza Hemophilus growing in the
   cultures from his recent abdominal surgery.  He also had coag negative
   staph growing from his PICC line from [**5-8**].  The line has since been
   removed.  Other possible sources for infection include empyema
   (although thoracentesis on [**5-7**] did not show evidence of organisms),
   pancreatitis (lipase slightly increasing), or pneumonia.
   - start fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 474**] coverage
   - start cefepime for broad gram negative and anaerobic coverage (has
   penicillin allergy)
   - continue vancomycin and cipro
   - f/u sensitivities , bcx, fungal cx, c. diff
   - will discuss possibility of thoracentesis with surgery if he
   continues to be febrile despite appropriate antibiotics
   - CT abdomen and pelvis with possible IR drainage today.
   # Delirium:
   This may be secondary to his pain medications or could be a
   manifestation of severe infection +/- sepsis.  If he is bacteremic or
   fungemic, would also consider the possibility of septic emboli, but not
   at threshold to image head without supportive culture data.
   - pain not well controlled, increase dilaudid to .25 mg IV q 2 hours.
   - haldol prn, per psych recs in chart
confirm QTc prior to dosing
   - ABG without hypercarbia
   # Anemia, Hct 30-31 on admission, currently 23.7, concerning for
   possible bleed considering heparin gtt
 one supratherapeutic measure
   on [**5-11**].
   - follow serial Hcts
   - active type and screen
   - If Hct drops less than current 23.7, contact surgery immediately for
   discussion re: transfusion.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for bleed.
   # Tachypnea with respiratory alkalosis:
   Likely related to pain, although he may also have some anxiety from
   being disoriented.
   - improve control, consider pain cosult.
   # Sinus Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE, tachypnea/respiratory
   distress, and infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis who underwent a splenectomy for a ruptured spleen. He presented to the ICU with fevers and tachycardia after an enteric leak repair. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance is negative with a net loss of 443 mL in 24 hours. There is also a decrease in serum albumin levels (2.2 g/dL) indicating possible malnutrition or chronic inflammation.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is disoriented and experiencing delirium, which may be secondary to his pain medications or severe infection/inflammation. Pain control measures have been initiated to manage this condition.

3. Pleural Effusion, Acute: A large sequestered fluid collection in the abdomen and increasing pleural effusion in the left lung have been identified on CT abdomen/thorax. Intraoperative radiation (IR) drainage is planned for tomorrow morning.

4. Tachycardia, Other: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia, which could be related to pain, pulmonary embolism (PE), anxiety, or infection.

5. Bacteremia: The patient has non-influenza Hemophilus growing in cultures from recent abdominal surgery, along with coag-negative staph from the PICC line."

   39yo gentleman with h/o recurrent pancreatitis s/p splenectomy for
   ruptured spleen who returns to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with fevers and tachycardia in
   the setting of recent enteric leak repair.
   # Fevers and Leukocytosis:
   Patient now has [**Female First Name (un) 474**] and non-influenza Hemophilus growing in the
   cultures from his recent abdominal surgery.  He also had coag negative
   staph growing from his PICC line from [**5-8**].  The line has since been
   removed.  Other possible sources for infection include empyema
   (although thoracentesis on [**5-7**] did not show evidence of organisms),
   pancreatitis (lipase slightly increasing), or pneumonia.
   - start fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 474**] coverage
   - start cefepime for broad gram negative and anaerobic coverage (has
   penicillin allergy)
   - continue vancomycin and cipro
   - f/u sensitivities , bcx, fungal cx, c. diff
   - will discuss possibility of thoracentesis with surgery if he
   continues to be febrile despite appropriate antibiotics
   - CT abdomen and pelvis with possible IR drainage today.
   # Delirium:
   This may be secondary to his pain medications or could be a
   manifestation of severe infection +/- sepsis.  If he is bacteremic or
   fungemic, would also consider the possibility of septic emboli, but not
   at threshold to image head without supportive culture data.
   - pain not well controlled, increase dilaudid to .25 mg IV q 2 hours.
   - haldol prn, per psych recs in chart
confirm QTc prior to dosing
   - ABG without hypercarbia
   # Anemia, Hct 30-31 on admission, currently 23.7, concerning for
   possible bleed considering heparin gtt
 one supratherapeutic measure
   on [**5-11**].
   - follow serial Hcts
   - active type and screen
   - If Hct drops less than current 23.7, contact surgery immediately for
   discussion re: transfusion.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for bleed.
   # Tachypnea with respiratory alkalosis:
   Likely related to pain, although he may also have some anxiety from
   being disoriented.
   - improve control, consider pain cosult.
   # Sinus Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial in setting of pain, PE, tachypnea/respiratory
   distress, and infection.
   - would avoid beta blocking sinus tachycardia and rather would treat
   underlying causes
   # Recent Splenectomy:
   - will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   - note that pt is infected with encapsulated organism
   # Subsegmental PEs:
   - stop heparin gtt per surgery today for CT Abdomen/Pelvis and possible
   IR intervention
   # Elevated platelets:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be inflammatory reaction, but elevation of platelets is extremely
   pronounced.
   - consult heme
   - monitor
   # Recurrent pancreatitis:
   Unclear cause, although would consider cystic fibrosis given family
   history.
   - recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical exam

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis who underwent a splenectomy for a ruptured spleen. He presented to the ICU with fevers and tachycardia following an enteric leak repair. The patient has been experiencing delirium, pain, and respiratory distress. He has been found to have non-influenza Hemophilus and coag-negative staph growing in cultures from his recent abdominal surgery. The patient's line has been removed, and he is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with possible IR drainage is planned today. The patient also has anemia, elevated platelets, and subsegmental pulmonary embolisms. Other potential sources of infection include empyema, pancreatitis, or pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps, weakness, or kidney problems.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium may be secondary to his pain medications or severe infection/sepsis. This could potentially progress to worsening confusion or agitation.
3. Pleural Effusion, Acute: The patient has an increasing pleural effusion in the left lung, which can cause respiratory distress and reduced oxygenation.
4. Tachycardia,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-inch tall and 113.6 kg male admitted to the ICU with AMS (acute mental status changes) and respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, thrombocytosis (likely essential thrombocytosis), electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, acute pleural effusion, tachycardia, bacteremia, pain control, pulmonary embolism (PE), leukocytosis, and leukopenia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with a range of 89-109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/71 mmHg to 149/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute with a range of 19-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a total fluid input of 4,403 mL with 997 mL given through the PO (oral) route and 3,558 mL through IVF (intravenous fluids), resulting in a total fluid output of 3,960 mL with 1,780 mL being blood products. The net fluid balance is 443 mL.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 15.4 to 21.9 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 23.7% to 31.6%, increased platelet count (Plt) ranging from 1109 to 1173, decreased creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 mg/dL, and various other abnormalities in electrolytes, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and coagulation profile.

The patient's recent medical history includes admissions on 2159-05-10, 2159-05-11, 2159-05-12, and 2159-05-13. The patient has allergies to erythromycin base, amoxicillin, and an unknown drug causing diarrhea. The patient has received multiple antibiotics including metronidazole, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and fluconazole.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of acute pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism (PE), sepsis due to bacteremia, and potential bleeding or clotting disorders due to thrombocytosis and abnormal coagulation profile. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are necessary to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yomh/o recurrent pancreatitis, recent surgery for splenectomy,
   enteric leak now with post-operative respiratory distress and delerium
   (recurrent).
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Much improved.  Multifactorial.  Suspect
   contribution of bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion,
   left atalectasis, pulmonary emboli (off anticoagulation), and abdominal
   pain (splinting).  Plan treat sepsis, antibiotics, iv fliuds, optimize
   pain management, maintain upright position.  Consider left
   thoracentesis if expands.
   TACHYCARDIA
 likley reflects respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia,
   possible pulmonary embolism.  Monitor HR, check EKG.  Replete iv fluid,
   optimize pain, treat sepsis/bacteremia.
   SEPSIS -- evidence for line-related infection and now suspect
   peritoneal source.  For Abd CT imaging to assess for collection.
   Continue Cipro, Cefopime, Vanco, Fluconozole.
   BACTEREMIA
 GPC, possible line related, but concern for enteric
   infection.  Remove central lines if possible (use peripheral if
   feasible).  Continue Vanco.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI
 left, subsegmental, multiple.  Continue
   anticoagulation  --> monitor PTT 60-80.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION
 suspect sympathetic and related to abdominal
   surgeries.  Doubt empyema, but consider diagnostic thoracentesis.
   Monitor.
   s/p ENTERIC LEAK --  NGT with intermittent suction, antibiotics, await
   culture results.  For Abd CT today.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT
 post-op.  s/p PCA pump --> need to optimize dosing
   and interval.
    s/p SPLENECTOMY -- will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   FLUID
 desire net volume expension.
   THROMBOCYTOSIS
 perhaps reactive.  ? reactive.  [**Month (only) 8**] be contributing to
   clotting (pulmonary emboli, clot on PICC line) as value exceeds 1
   million.  Monitor.  Hematology consult.
   DELERIUM
 recurrent.  Possible related to medications and contribution
   of sepsis (toxic-metabolic).  Improved this AM.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Trophic TF.  Resume TPN once central
   access established.
   RECURRENT PANCREATITS -- Unclear cause, but consider cystic fibrosis
   given family history.  Recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical
   exam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male who presented with recurrent pancreatitis, recent surgery for splenectomy, and an enteric leak. He is currently experiencing post-operative respiratory distress and delirium. The patient's condition has improved, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has shown improvement in respiratory distress, but factors such as bacteremia and sepsis, left pleural effusion, left atelectasis, pulmonary emboli, and abdominal pain may contribute to recurrent respiratory issues. Treatment includes managing sepsis, antibiotics, IV fluids, optimizing pain management, and maintaining an upright position.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate is likely due to respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia, possible pulmonary embolism, or other factors. Monitoring the heart rate and checking an EKG is advised. Repleting IV fluid, optimizing pain management, and treating sepsis/bacteremia are recommended.

3. Sepsis: There is evidence of line-related infection and a suspected peritoneal source. Imaging for abdominal CT to assess for collections is planned. Continuing Cipro, Cefepime, Vancomycin, and Fluconazole is recommended.

4. Bacteremia: GPC, possibly line-related, but concern for enteric infection. Removing central lines if possible and using peripheral if feasible is suggested. Continuing Vancom"

   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Much improved.  Multifactorial.  Suspect
   contribution of bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion,
   left atalectasis, pulmonary emboli (off anticoagulation), and abdominal
   pain (splinting).  Plan treat sepsis, antibiotics, iv fliuds, optimize
   pain management, maintain upright position.  Consider left
   thoracentesis if expands.
   TACHYCARDIA
 likley reflects respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia,
   possible pulmonary embolism.  Monitor HR, check EKG.  Replete iv fluid,
   optimize pain, treat sepsis/bacteremia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis, recent surgery for splenectomy, and enteric leak. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing respiratory distress, tachycardia, sepsis, bacteremia, pulmonary emboli, pleural effusion, pain, thrombocytosis, and delirium. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with possible contributions from bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion, left atelectasis, pulmonary emboli, and abdominal pain. The patient's pain management plan includes optimizing dosing and interval on the PCA pump. The patient's nutritional support is currently NPO, with trophic tube feeds and planned resumption of TPN once central access is established.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing post-operative respiratory distress, which can be caused by various factors such as left pleural effusion, left atelectasis, pulmonary emboli, and abdominal pain. It is important to treat sepsis, optimize pain management, maintain an upright position, and consider left thoracentesis if the effusion expands.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia, and possible pulmonary embolism. Monitoring the heart rate, checking EKG, repleting IV fluids, optimizing pain"

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of recurrent pancreatitis, recent surgery for splenectomy, and enteric leak. The patient is currently experiencing post-operative respiratory distress and delirium. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has improved but still requires treatment for respiratory distress. Possible contributing factors include bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion, left atelectasis, pulmonary emboli (off anticoagulation), and abdominal pain (splinting). It is important to continue treating sepsis, antibiotics, IV fluids, optimize pain management, and maintain an upright position. Consideration should also be given to left thoracentesis if the pleural effusion expands.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has improved but is still elevated. Factors contributing to tachycardia may include respiratory distress, pain, hypovolemia, and possible pulmonary embolism. Monitoring of the heart rate and EKG is recommended, along with repletion of IV fluids, optimization of pain management, and treatment for sepsis/bacteremia.

3. Sepsis: There is evidence of line-related infection and suspicion of a peritoneal source. Imaging of the abdomen through a CT scan is suggested to assess for any collections. Antibiotics should be continued, including Cipro, Cefepime, Vancomycin,"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yomh/o recurrent pancreatitis, recent surgery for splenectomy,
   enteric leak now with post-operative respiratory distress and delerium
   (recurrent).
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Much improved.  Multifactorial.  Suspect
   contribution of bacteremia and sepsis, acidosis, left pleural effusion,
   left atalectasis, pulmonary emboli (off anticoagulation), and abdominal
   pain (splinting).  Continue treat sepsis, antibiotics, iv fliuds,
   optimize pain management, maintain upright position.  Consider left
   thoracentesis if expands.
   TACHYCARDIA
 Improved.  Likley reflected respiratory distress, pain,
   hypovolemia, possible pulmonary embolism.  Monitor HR, check EKG.
   Replete iv fluid, optimize pain, treat sepsis/bacteremia.
   SEPSIS -- evidence for line-related infection and now suspect
   peritoneal source.  For Abd CT imaging to assess for collection.
   Continue Cipro, Cefopime, Vanco, Fluconozole.
   BACTEREMIA
 GPC, possible line related, but concern for enteric
   infection.  Remove central lines if possible (use peripheral if
   feasible).  Continue Vanco.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI
 left, subsegmental, multiple.  Continue
   anticoagulation  --> monitor PTT 60-80.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION
 suspect sympathetic and related to abdominal
   surgeries.  S/p drainage.   Chest tube not draining, and without
   respiratory variation on water seal --> would D/C.
   s/p ENTERIC LEAK --  NGT with intermittent suction, antibiotics, await
   culture results.  For Abd CT today.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT
 post-op.  Improved on Dilaudid PCA pump.
    s/p SPLENECTOMY -- will need meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines
   FLUID
 Euvolemic.  Monitor I/O, maintain balance.
   THROMBOCYTOSIS
 perhaps reactive.  ? reactive.  [**Month (only) 8**] be contributing to
   clotting (pulmonary emboli, clot on PICC line) as value exceeds 1
   million.  Monitor.  Hematology consult.
   DELERIUM
 recurrent.  Possible related to medications and contribution
   of sepsis (toxic-metabolic).  Improved this AM.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Trophic TF.  Resume TPN once central
   access established.
   RECURRENT PANCREATITS -- Unclear cause, but consider cystic fibrosis
   given family history.  Recheck amylase, lipase and monitor clinical
   exam.
