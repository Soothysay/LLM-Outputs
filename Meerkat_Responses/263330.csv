","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia and anxiety. She was admitted from an outside hospital with left main coronary artery disease. The patient is currently chest pain-free and has no evidence of anginal equivalent pain. Cardiac catheterization today demonstrated a 95% occlusion of her left main coronary artery, necessitating evaluation by cardiac surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has significant blockage in her left main coronary artery, which could lead to complications such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina if not treated promptly.
2. Heart failure: The patient's ejection fraction was found to be 35% during cardiac catheterization, indicating reduced heart function. This increases the risk of heart failure, especially if the patient undergoes surgery.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but given her cardiac history and the planned surgery, there is a risk of developing arrhythmias postoperatively.
4. Aortic stenosis: The patient has mild aortic stenosis, which may require further evaluation and consideration of aortic valve replacement at the time of surgery.
5. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency, and it is important to monitor and manage her anemia appropriately.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes should be closely monitored due to the ongoing heparin drip"
