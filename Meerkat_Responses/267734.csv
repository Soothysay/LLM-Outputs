   & progressive lethargy with a work-up concerning for multifocal
   pneumonia & UTI.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratoy failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection.   HCO3 38 on admission, not usually so high
   (baseline 30).  ? Aggressive diuresis. Potentially due to poor
   respiratory controller function secondary to overmedication, or poor
   respiratory muscle function. Could be due to prior C-spine injury
   causing phrenic nerve injury worsening respiratory dynamics. [**Month (only) 60**] also
   consider PE and infection/pneumonia. S/p tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**]
   incarcerated hernia repair and failure to wean.  Unclear if aspiration
   risk but on po diet at NS.  CXR with ? PNA vs volume overload.
    - Treat infection as above
    - Venturi FM
    - Discuss recent baseline labs / medication changes with [**Hospital1 169**] in AM
   - Check Depakote level
   - Check LFTs
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - CTA to evaluate for PE.
   - Treat infection (Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]); Azithromycin added for atypicals
   - Urine legionella antigen; will d/c azithromycin if legionella
   negative.
   - Sputum / blood culture as able
   - BNP level

   # Lethargy/AMS:  Lethargy and minimalizing localizing symptoms.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definately contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Urine culture
    - On Venturi facemask now.
    - Valproic acid level
    - Hold Risperdal / Depakote given AMS
    - Monitor with serial VBGs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, presenting with mental status changes, anorexia, and progressive lethargy. The work-up is concerning for multifocal pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a Venturi facemask and shows signs of hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a suspicion of multifactorial causes, including chronic hypercarbia at baseline, excess volume, and infection. The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has had a tracheostomy in the past.

The plan includes treating the infection with vancomycin and azithromycin, checking the Depakote level, and performing a CTA to evaluate for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's lethargy and minimalizing localizing symptoms are likely due to hypercarbia and resolved with improvement in respiratory status. 

Other issues mentioned in the note include a UTI with hematuria, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease with chronic venous stasis changes and Proteus wound infection, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and urinary incontinence. 

The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is pending clinical improvement before disposition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further infection, and potential complications related"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and urinary incontinence. She was admitted to the ICU with mental status changes, anorexia, progressive lethargy, and suspected multifocal pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/69 mmHg to 180/96 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 89%. She is on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 242 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.17, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 99 mmHg, and oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 189. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but her lactic acid level is elevated at 1.5 mmol/L.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has an elevated PaCO2 level of 99 mmHg, indicating respiratory acidosis. This may be due to poor respiratory muscle function, overmedication,"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypercarbic respiratoy failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection.   Based on CXR, likely pneumonia.  HCO3 38 on
   admission, not usually so high (baseline 30).  ? Aggressive diuresis.
   Potentially due to poor respiratory controller function secondary to
   overmedication, or poor respiratory muscle function. Could be due to
   prior C-spine injury causing phrenic nerve injury worsening respiratory
   dynamics. [**Month (only) 60**] also consider PE and infection/pneumonia. S/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean.  Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  CXR with ? PNA
   vs volume overload.
    - Treat infection
 now has diffuse rash on vanco/azithro
 will talk
   with ID about linezolid/aztreonam
   - consider derm consult if rash progresses
    - Venturi FM
    - Discuss recent baseline labs / medication changes with [**Hospital1 169**]/ clarify
   allergies
   - Check Depakote level
   - Check LFTs
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - CTA to evaluate for PE.
   - Treat infection (Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]); Azithromycin added for atypicals
   - Urine legionella antigen; will d/c azithromycin if legionella
   negative.
   - Sputum / blood culture as able
   - Noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Lethargy and minimalizing localizing symptoms.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definately contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Urine culture
    - On Venturi facemask now.
    - Valproic acid level
    - Hold Risperdal / Depakote given AMS
    - Monitor with serial ABGs
   - Access: get Picc and arterial line.

   # UTI:  UA with hematuria. H/o Cipro-R E.coli.  Denies any complaints.
    - [**Last Name (un) **]/Vanco
 as above, will touch base with ID regarding antibiotic
   regimen treatment
    - Follow-up culture (adding from ICU)

   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient.  Unclear if given today.
    - Will hold while unclear volume status
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]

   # Bipolar disorder:  On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote levels.
   .
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   .
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history. Will plan to discuss with daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] family,
   unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place

","The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial. This may be due to chronic hypercarbia at baseline, excess volume, infection, poor respiratory controller function secondary to overmedication, or poor respiratory muscle function. Other factors such as prior cervical spine injury causing phrenic nerve injury worsening respiratory dynamics should also be considered.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has an increased risk of pneumonia due to poor respiratory function and potential aspiration risk. The chest X-ray shows possible pneumonia.

3. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with hematuria, and there is a concern for hospital-acquired infection given the rash from vancomycin and azithromycin. The patient's urine culture should be monitored, and strict input/output measurements should be taken.

4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has hypertension, but it is unclear if the medication was given today. The patient's blood pressure should be monitored closely, especially considering the unclear volume status.

5. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has chronic venous stasis changes and Proteus wound infections. These should be monitored and managed accordingly.

6. Bipolar disorder: The patient is on risperdal and depakote for bipolar disorder. However, due to altered mental status, these medications have been held. The patient's Depakote level"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who is admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 125/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on BiPAP. The patient has a history of allergies to ciprofloxacin, penicillins, and Percocet. The patient received antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased secretions, which were noted to be yellowish and sent for culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation of 90% on BiPAP indicates potential respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Infection: The yellowish secretions and need for cultures suggest a possible infection. Regular assessment of vital signs and laboratory parameters will help in identifying any signs of worsening infection.
3. Medication Allergies: The patient has allergies to ciprofloxacin, penicillins, and Percocet. It is important to avoid these medications to prevent allergic reactions.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,206 mL and output of 1,073 mL over 24 hours, resulting in a positive"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypercarbic respiratoy failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection.   HCO3 38 on admission, not usually so high
   (baseline 30).  ? Aggressive diuresis. Potentially due to poor
   respiratory controller function secondary to overmedication, or poor
   respiratory muscle function. Could be due to prior C-spine injury
   causing phrenic nerve injury worsening respiratory dynamics. [**Month (only) 60**] also
   consider PE and infection/pneumonia. S/p tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**]
   incarcerated hernia repair and failure to wean.  Unclear if aspiration
   risk but on po diet at NS.  CXR with ? PNA vs volume overload.
    - Treat infection as above
    - Venturi FM
    - Discuss recent baseline labs / medication changes with [**Hospital1 169**] in AM
   - Check Depakote level
   - Check LFTs
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - CTA to evaluate for PE.
   - Treat infection (Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]); Azithromycin added for atypicals
   - Urine legionella antigen; will d/c azithromycin if legionella
   negative.
   - Sputum / blood culture as able
   - BNP level
   .
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Lethargy and minimalizing localizing symptoms.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definately contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Urine culture
    - On Venturi facemask now.
    - Valproic acid level
    - Hold Risperdal / Depakote given AMS
    - Monitor with serial VBGs
   - Access: get Picc and arterial line.
   .
   # UTI:  UA with hematuria. H/o Cipro-R E.coli.  Denies any complaints.
    - [**Last Name (un) **]/Vanco
    - Follow-up culture (adding from ICU)
   - Obtaining PM Hct due to hematuria
   .
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient.  Unclear if given today.
    - Will break into short-acting while unclear volume status (consider
   holding)
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.  No ulcerations on exam.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Bipolar disorder:  On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote levels.
   .
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   .
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history. Will plan to discuss with daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] family,
   unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place
   .
   FEN: IVF o/n (monitor uop), replete electrolytes, NPO while on BiPAP
   - Clear liquids today and advance diet with improvement in mental
   status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and has shown improvement in her respiratory status. However, she still requires BiPAP intermittently. She is also on multiple antibiotics for pneumonia and a possible Legionella infection. The patient has had ongoing moderately high blood loss in her urine, which is concerning for another process besides a simple UTI. She has a rash that is likely due to a drug reaction. She is lethargic and has minimalizing localizing symptoms. Her mental status is fluctuating, and she is holding Risperdal and Depakote due to altered mental status (AMS). Her blood pressure is being held due to elevated pressures. She has chronic venous stasis changes and a Proteus wound infection in her lower extremities. She has a history of an incarcerated hernia repair and failure to wean from the ventilator. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time but is disoriented to date. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 13. She is unable to move her right arm and is not ambulatory. Her"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient has been on BIPAP intermittently and has shown decreased urine output since yesterday evening. Irrigation with 100cc of fluid returned pink in color, indicating possible blood in the urine. The patient was given a 1L NS bolus with minimal change in urine output. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/62 mmHg to 171/126 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set FiO2 of 50%. The physical examination shows no peripheral vascular assessment and no neurologic assessment due to intubation. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.6-9.4 x 10^9/L, anemia with Hct levels of 44.5-42.1%, thrombocytopenia with Plt levels of 133-140 x 10^9/L, elevated creatinine at 0.4-0.3 mg/dL, and slightly low TCO2 levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratoy Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection.  PNA on CXR. Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission.
   No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated
   hernia repair and failure to wean.  Unclear if aspiration risk but on
   po diet at NS.
   - Treat PNA: now linezolid/aztreonam
   - Venturi FM
   -Discuss recent baseline labs / medication changes with [**Hospital1 169**]/ clarify
   allergies
   - Check Depakote level
   - Check LFTs
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - Treat infection (Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]); Azithromycin added for atypicals
   - Urine legionella antigen; will d/c azithromycin if legionella
   negative.
   - Sputum / blood culture as able
   - Noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially
   thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume concerning for other
   process. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R ecoli.
    - consult urology
    - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
    - intermittent irrigation as needed
    - [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
    - f/u urine cx
   # RASH: likely drug reaction
    - consider derm consult if rash progresses
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Lethargy and minimalizing localizing symptoms.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definately contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Urine cultures
   - On Venturi facemask now.
   - Valproic acid level
   - Hold Risperdal / Depakote given AMS
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder:  On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote levels.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history. Will plan to discuss with daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] family,
   unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, probable urinary tract infection (UTI), and pneumonia (PNA).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline HCO3 level is elevated at 30, indicating chronic hypercarbia. The acute exacerbation may be due to factors such as excess volume, infection, or difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and ABGs is necessary.

2. UTI/Hematuria: The patient has ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially thought to be a simple UTI but now concerning for another process. Denying any complaints, she has a history of Cipro-resistant E. coli. A consult with urology is recommended, along with continued antibiotics coverage, intermittent irrigation, and Hct checks.

3. RASH: The patient has a likely drug reaction. Consideration for a dermatology consult is needed if the rash progresses.

4. Lethargy/Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is lethargic and minimizes localizing symptoms. Work-up notable for positive urine analysis (with a history of Cipro-resistant E. coli)"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratoy Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection.  PNA on CXR. Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission.
   No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated
   hernia repair and failure to wean.  Unclear if aspiration risk but on
   po diet at NS.
   - Treat PNA: now linezolid/aztreonam
   - Venturi FM
   -Discuss recent baseline labs / medication changes with [**Hospital1 169**]/ clarify
   allergies
   - Check Depakote level
   - Check LFTs
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - Treat infection (Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]); Azithromycin added for atypicals
   - Urine legionella antigen; will d/c azithromycin if legionella
   negative.
   - Sputum / blood culture as able
   - Noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially
   thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume concerning for other
   process. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R ecoli.
    - consult urology
    - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
    - intermittent irrigation as needed
    - [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
    - f/u urine cx
   # RASH: likely drug reaction
    - consider derm consult if rash progresses
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Lethargy and minimalizing localizing symptoms.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definately contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Urine cultures
   - On Venturi facemask now.
   - Valproic acid level
   - Hold Risperdal / Depakote given AMS
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder:  On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote levels.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history. Will plan to discuss with daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] family,
   unable to move R arm and not ambulatory

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) admitted for acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and has shown improvement in respiratory status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 106/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on aerosol-cool delivery device with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's physical examination reveals anterior rhonchi throughout, decreased at bases, regular rapid respirations, soft bowel sounds, and intact pulses with marked darkening of tissue and venous stasis changes in both lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, platelet count of 134 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, chloride of 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 38 mEq/L, blood glucose of 95 mg/dL, and pH of 7.33. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pCO2 of 68 mmHg, pO2 of 78 mmHg, HCO3 of 37 mEq/L, base excess of 6, and type of art.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, UTI, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, and a history of CVA. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, renal failure, worsening of peripheral vascular disease, exacerbation of bipolar disorder, and further neurological decline."

   - Suspect may be related to renal dysfunction/hematuria. Pt w/ low UPO
   despite boluses, and w/ normal MAP
   - Consider urology consult in AM
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratoy Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection.  PNA on CXR. Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission.
   No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated

    - consider derm consult if rash progresses
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Lethargy and minimalizing localizing symptoms.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs [**First Name3 (LF) 2087**].  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definately contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI). She is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and has tracheostomy in place. The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AF) and is on IV diltiazem. She presents with lethargy, minimalizing localizing symptoms, +UA, and CXR showing volume overload. The patient has low urine output (UOP) and a fine macular rash extending to the axilla and anterior chest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be caused by factors such as chronic hypercarbia, excess volume, or infection. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and NPPV support is necessary.
2. UTI/Hematuria: The patient has ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially thought to be a simple UTI but concerning for another process. This may require further investigation and treatment.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset AF, which needs to be managed with appropriate anticoagulation therapy and rate control medications.
4. Low Urine Output:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and urinary incontinence. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and a probable urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), and possible aspiration risk.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/86 to 185/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on BiPAP. She is lethargic but arousable, with no evidence of fever or leukocytosis.

She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, UTI/hematuria, low urine output, and a rash that appears to be resolving. Her cardiac enzymes are negative, and her blood cultures are pending.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of BUN, creatinine, and lactic acid, with decreased levels of albumin and potassium. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and her platelet count is within normal range. Her liver function tests are also within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies reveal chronic venous stasis changes in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, CVA with right hemiplegia, PVD, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and a probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and a history of incarcerated hernia repair. She is currently in the ICU on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and has been agitated, requiring sedation with lorazepam. The patient's echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. She also has pulmonary hypertension and calcified mitral and aortic valves without significant stenosis or regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic hypercarbia, which may be exacerbated by factors such as excess volume, infection, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2. UTI: The patient has a history of Cipro-resistant E. coli and is currently on antibiotics for a suspected UTI. However, the presence of hematuria raises concerns for a more serious urinary tract pathology.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 82 mg/dL, but without additional information, it is unclear if this indicates"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Follow ABG
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam
   - Venturi FM/ Intermittent BIPAP
   -  Lasix 20 mg IV today
   - OOB to chair
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Have speech evaluate today
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF v. PVCs on [**3-10**]. No history of AF per
   documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 prn.  Was given lopressor ,
   however may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE
   negative.  TSH normal
   - Continue diuresis
   - Give diltiazem IV prn for tachycardia, avoid beta blocker as may have
   worsened her resp. status
   - cycle cardiac enzymes--
 negative X3
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Pt. more disoriented after getting low dose of Ativan
   for agitation overnight [**3-10**].  Present work-up notable for +UA (with
   history of Cipro-R E.coli) and CXR which appears more volume
   over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile, without leukocytosis.  Family
   notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider aspiration, viral vs
   atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is definitely contributing.
   Resolved with improvement in respiratory status.
   - DC ativan and add to allergy list
   - F/U Urine cultures
   - On Venturi facemask now.
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially
   thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume concerning for other
   process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - will defer urology c/s at this time
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - QD hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of -500cc today.
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
    - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, diurese, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   Access: PIV, A Line, PICC
   Code: DNR/DNI  (confirmed with patient upon arrival to ICU)
   Communication: Patient & daughter [**Name (NI) 1040**]
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; likely transfer to MACU
   in next few days
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bipolar disorder.
- She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She has a tracheostomy and is on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
- The patient's ammonia level has come down since stopping Depakote.
- She failed a speech and swallow evaluation and refused a feeding tube.
- The patient is lethargic and disoriented, with a recent history of coughing.
- She has ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially thought to be a simple UTI but now concerning for another process.
- She has low urine output, which improved on Lasix.
- The patient has a rash, likely a drug reaction.
- She has peripheral vascular disease and chronic venous stasis changes.
- She has a history of diverticulosis and is at baseline for urinary incontinence.
- The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right hemiplegia and is unable to provide further history.
- Her code status is DNR/DNI.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications, including metoprolol, furosemide, and heparin sodium.

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test yesterday
   - Follow ABG
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam
   - Venturi FM/ Intermittent BIPAP
   - Pt diuresed w/ 60 mg IV lasix yesterday, negative approx 500 cc for
   the day
 will give additional Lasix with goal -1L today
   - OOB to chair
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - Sputum / blood culture as able
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF as of this morning. No history of AF per
   documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 prn.  Was given lopressor
   yesterday.  CE negative.  TSH normal
   - Continue diuresis w/ 40 IV lasix this AM
   - Give diltiazem IV prn for tachycardia, avoid beta blocker as may have
   worsened her resp. status
   - cycle cardiac enzymes--
 negative X3
   - switch dilt to gtt
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Pt. more disoriented after getting low dose of Ativan
   for agitation overnight [**3-10**].  Present work-up notable for +UA (with
   history of Cipro-R E.coli) and CXR which appears more volume
   over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile, without leukocytosis.  Family
   notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider aspiration, viral vs
   atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is definately contributing.
   Resolved with improvement in respiratory status.
   - DC ativan and add to allergy list
   - F/U Urine cultures
   - On Venturi facemask now.
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Hold Risperdal / Depakote given AMS
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   - Will recheck Ammonia level on Fri AM labs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially
   thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume concerning for other
   process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - will defer urology c/s at this time
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of -1L today.
   # Nutrition: currently not able to take PO safely per speech and
   swallow
   -Pt refusing Dobhoff and PEG
   -
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
    - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been experiencing increasingly productive cough, difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, and is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent effects on the cardiovascular system.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of Ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and is experiencing moderately high blood loss in urine. This raises concerns for a possible complicated UTI or another urinary tract pathology.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within the lower range (142/86 mmHg), indicating potential hypotension, especially considering her history of hypertension.

4. Delirium: The patient exhibits delirium, especially after receiving a low dose of Ativan (Lorazepam) for agitation. This highlights the need for close monitoring and adjustment of medications.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Follow ABG
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam
   - Venturi FM/ Intermittent BIPAP
   -  Lasix 20 mg IV today
   - OOB to chair
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Have speech evaluate today
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF v. PVCs on [**3-10**]. No history of AF per
   documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 prn.  Was given lopressor ,
   however may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE
   negative.  TSH normal
   - Continue diuresis
   - Give diltiazem IV prn for tachycardia, avoid beta blocker as may have
   worsened her resp. status
   - cycle cardiac enzymes--
 negative X3
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Pt. more disoriented after getting low dose of Ativan
   for agitation overnight [**3-10**].  Present work-up notable for +UA (with
   history of Cipro-R E.coli) and CXR which appears more volume
   over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile, without leukocytosis.  Family
   notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider aspiration, viral vs
   atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is definitely contributing.
   Resolved with improvement in respiratory status.
   - DC ativan and add to allergy list
   - F/U Urine cultures
   - On Venturi facemask now.
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially
   thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume concerning for other
   process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - will defer urology c/s at this time
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - QD hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of -500cc today.
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
    - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bipolar disorder. She was admitted to the ICU for acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and has shown improvement in her respiratory status.

The patient's medical history includes a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease, and diverticulosis. She has a history of being a poor candidate for enteral feeding due to failed speech and swallow evaluation. The patient's family notes a history of coughing and possible aspiration, but this has not been confirmed.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient experienced several complications, including lethargy with altered mental status (AMS), atrial fibrillation (AF), rashes, hypotension, and low urine output. The rashes were likely due to a drug reaction, and the patient's blood pressure was initially managed with diltiazem, which was later held due to worsening respiratory status. The patient's low urine output improved with the administration of lasix.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and was on risperidone and divalproex sodium. However, due to altered mental status, these medications were held.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and urinary incontinence. She was admitted to the ICU with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient has been receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and has shown improvement in her respiratory status. Her ammonia levels have decreased since stopping Depakote. She remains on linezolid and aztreonam for UTI.

The patient has refused Dobhoff/PEG tube and has been evaluated for speech and swallowing difficulties. She is currently on a regular diet at the neuroscience floor.

She also has new-onset atrial fibrillation and is being monitored closely. Her lethargy and altered mental status (AMS) have resolved with improvement in respiratory status.

Other medical issues include ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, possibly related to a UTI, low urine output that has improved with Lasix, a rash likely due to a drug reaction, hypertension currently being managed with Diltiazem, chronic venous stasis changes with a Proteus wound infection, bipolar disorder medications held due to AMS, diverticulosis, and a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline hypercarbia may continue to contribute to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and follow-up ABGs are necessary.

2. UTI/Hematuria: The patient has ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine and a history of Cipro-resistant E. coli. It is important to defer more extensive workup to an outpatient setting, continue aztreonam/linezolid, and monitor for any signs of worsening infection or other processes.

3. Lethargy/AMS: Although the patient's AMS has resolved, it is important to remain vigilant for any signs of recurrence, especially in the context of medication changes or infections.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's new-onset AF should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to control heart rate if necessary.

5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs ongoing management, considering the current hold on Diltiazem.

6. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's chronic venous stasis changes and Proteus wound infection require regular monitoring and appropriate wound care.

7. Bipolar Disorder: The patient's bipolar disorder medications need to be restarted cautiously once her AMS has resolved.

8. Diverticulosis/LGIB: The patient's history of diverticulosis and LGIB should be monitored for any signs of recurrence or complications.

9. s/p CVA: The patient's neurological status and motor deficits need continued evaluation"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Follow ABG
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam
   - Venturi FM/ Intermittent BIPAP
   -  Lasix 20 mg IV today
   - OOB to chair
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Have speech evaluate today
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF v. PVCs on [**3-10**]. No history of AF per
   documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 prn.  Was given lopressor ,
   however may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE
   negative.  TSH normal
   - Continue diuresis
   - Give diltiazem IV prn for tachycardia, avoid beta blocker as may have
   worsened her resp. status
   - cycle cardiac enzymes--
 negative X3
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Pt. more disoriented after getting low dose of Ativan
   for agitation overnight [**3-10**].  Present work-up notable for +UA (with
   history of Cipro-R E.coli) and CXR which appears more volume
   over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile, without leukocytosis.  Family
   notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider aspiration, viral vs
   atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is definitely contributing.
   Resolved with improvement in respiratory status.
   - DC ativan and add to allergy list
   - F/U Urine cultures
   - On Venturi facemask now.
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially
   thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume concerning for other
   process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - will defer urology c/s at this time
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - QD hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of -500cc today.
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
    - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, diurese, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   Access: PIV, A Line, PICC
   Code: DNR/DNI  (confirmed with patient upon arrival to ICU)
   Communication: Patient & daughter [**Name (NI) 1040**]
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; likely transfer to MACU

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of BLL
   pneumonia, probably due to aspiration. Back in NSR, echo with small LV,
   elevated EF, mild PHTN.
   Exam notable for Tm 96.7 BP 140/73 HR 78-108 RR 22 with sat 92 on
   0.35FM 7.32/78/86 on FM. Intermittently requiring NIPPV for hypercarbic
   resp failure with mental status changes. TBB -550cc/24.
   Currently awake, alert, smiling, responding to questions. Coarse BS,
   [**Month (only) **] B bases. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS, chronic stasis changes. Diffuse
   erythematous blanching rash, stable according to house staff.
   Labs notable for WBC 6K, HCT 40, K+ 3.5, Cr 0.3. CXR unchanged BLL ASD.
   Agree with plan to manage acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory
   failure with NPPV PRN, though currently well on FM, continue treatment
   of HAP with linezolid / aztronam as well as repeat lasix for pulmonary
   edema.
   For AF c RVR - dilt IV, gentle diuresis; could add dig if rate remains
   high and BP trends down. Gross hematuria has resolved. Failed S+S - pt
   / family does not want doboff or PEG. Will discuss with pt and family
   that she could try thickened dysphagia diet at risk of aspiration and
   death, or will be NPO given her requests. OOB to chair. CM to screen
   for LTAC level of care. DNR/I. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right-sided hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and urinary incontinence. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's baseline HCO3 level is 30, and it increased to 38 on admission. She has a history of chronic hypercarbia, volume overload, and infection. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient underwent tracheostomy on [**4-/2096**] for incarcerated hernia repair and failed weaning. She also has a history of aspiration risk but is currently on a regular diet at the nursing station (NS). Ammonia level has decreased since stopping Depakote. The patient failed speech and swallow evaluation and refused Dobhoff/PEG. She is on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. It is multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess volume +/- infection. She continues to have radiographic evidence of pneumonia (PNA) on chest X-ray"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Follow ABG
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam for total of [**10-13**] days
   - Venturi FM/ Intermittent BIPAP
   -  Lasix 20 mg IV today
   - OOB to chair
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Have speech evaluate Monday
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF v. PVCs on [**3-10**]. No history of AF per
   documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 prn.  Was given lopressor ,
   however may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE
   negative.  TSH normal
   - Continue diuresis
   - Give diltiazem IV prn for tachycardia, avoid beta blocker as may have
   worsened her resp. status
   - cycle cardiac enzymes--
 negative X3
   # Lethargy/AMS:  Pt. more disoriented after getting low dose of Ativan
   for agitation overnight [**3-10**].  Present work-up notable for +UA (with
   history of Cipro-R E.coli) and CXR which appears more volume
   over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile, without leukocytosis.  Family
   notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider aspiration, viral vs
   atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is definitely contributing.
   Resolved with improvement in respiratory status.
   - DC ativan and added to allergy list
   - On nasal cannula now. Mental status much improved
   - Will start  home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially
   thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume concerning for other
   process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - will defer urology c/s at this time
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - QD hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of -500cc today.
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
   - Appears to be improving clinically
   - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and receiving IV antibiotics.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is suspected to be multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline, excess volume, and infection. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA).
2. Probable UTI: The patient has a probable UTI, as indicated by symptoms such as increasingly productive cough and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (PNA) on chest X-ray.
3. Incarcerated Hernia Repair: The patient had a tracheostomy in [date] for incarcerated hernia repair and failed weaning from mechanical ventilation.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) on [date], and her heart rate is being monitored.
5. Lethargy/Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient experienced episodes of lethargy and AMS after receiving a"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of BLL
   pneumonia, probably due to aspiration. Back in NSR, echo with small LV,
   elevated EF, mild PHTN.
   Exam notable for Tm 96.7 BP 140/73 HR 78-108 RR 22 with sat 92 on
   0.35FM 7.32/78/86 on FM. Intermittently requiring NIPPV for hypercarbic
   resp failure with mental status changes. TBB -550cc/24.
   Currently awake, alert, smiling, responding to questions. Coarse BS,
   [**Month (only) **] B bases. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS, chronic stasis changes. Diffuse
   erythematous blanching rash, stable according to house staff.
   Labs notable for WBC 6K, HCT 40, K+ 3.5, Cr 0.3. CXR unchanged BLL ASD.
   Agree with plan to manage acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory
   failure with NPPV PRN, though currently well on FM, continue treatment
   of HAP with linezolid / aztronam as well as repeat lasix for pulmonary
   edema.
   For AF c RVR - dilt IV, gentle diuresis; could add dig if rate remains
   high and BP trends down. Gross hematuria has resolved. Failed S+S - pt
   / family does not want doboff or PEG. Will discuss with pt and family
   that she could try thickened dysphagia diet at risk of aspiration and
   death, or will be NPO given her requests. OOB to chair. CM to screen
   for LTAC level of care. DNR/I. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic venous insufficiency, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted to the ICU with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, lethargy/confusion, UTI with hematuria, rash, low urine output, and peripheral vascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline hypercarbia has worsened, leading to acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. This could potentially lead to further respiratory distress and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. UTI/Hematuria: The patient is experiencing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially thought to be a simple UTI but now concerning for another process. If left untreated, it could lead to sepsis or further kidney complications.
3. Lethargy/AMS: The patient's mental status changes may be due to various factors such as hypercarbia, UTI, or medication adverse effects. If not addressed, it could progress to worsening confusion, increased risk of falls, and difficulty in communication.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. If not managed appropriately, it could lead to hemodynamic instability, stroke, or thromboembolic events.
5. RASH:"

   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Follow ABG

   # Lethargy/AMS:  Pt. more disoriented after getting low dose of Ativan
   for agitation overnight [**3-10**].  Present work-up notable for +UA (with
   history of Cipro-R E.coli) and CXR which appears more volume
   over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile, without leukocytosis.  Family
   notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider aspiration, viral vs
   atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is definitely contributing.
   Resolved with improvement in respiratory status.
   - DC ativan and added to allergy list
   - On nasal cannula now. Mental status much improved
   - Will start  home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bipolar disorder. She was admitted to the ICU with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and a probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has several medical complications including atrial fibrillation, lethargy/acute mental status changes (AMS), urinary incontinence, peripheral vascular disease, and diverticulosis. She is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and has had multiple IV lines placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing hypercarbia. This may lead to further respiratory acidosis and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. UTI/Hematuria: The patient has ongoing moderately high blood loss in urine, initially thought to be a simple UTI but given volume concerns for other processes. This could progress to sepsis or kidney infection if not treated appropriately.
3. AMS/Lethargy: The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with episodes of AMS and lethargy. This could be due to various factors including infection, medication effects, or metabolic imbalances. Close monitoring and further investigation are required to determine the underlying cause.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which may contribute to her"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF. No history of AF per documentation. On IV
   dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 pr.  Was given lopressor , however may have
   contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE negative.  TSH normal.
   Got diltiazem 10mg IV
   - Starting diltiazem drip titrated to HR <110, SBP >80
   - EKG
   - Transition to PO diltiazem pending passing speech and swallow
   evaluation today.
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam for total of [**10-13**] days
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat > 92%
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   - Lasix 20mg IV x1 today, follow UOP for goal euvolemic
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Speech and swallow evaluation today
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Lethargy/AMS:  At baseline today. Agitated, anxious overnight.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definitely contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Will start  home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: Hematuria improved. Ongoing moderately high blood loss
   in urine, initially thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume
   concerning for other process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R
   ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - QD hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of -500cc today.
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
   - Appears to be improving clinically
   - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place

   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF. No history of AF per documentation. On IV
   dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 pr.  Was given lopressor , however may have
   contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE negative.  TSH normal.
   Got diltiazem 10mg IV
   - Starting diltiazem drip titrated to HR <110, SBP >80
   - EKG
   - Transition to PO diltiazem pending passing speech and swallow
   evaluation today.
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam for total of [**10-13**] days
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat > 92%
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   - Lasix 20mg IV x1 today, follow UOP for goal euvolemic
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Speech and swallow evaluation today
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Lethargy/AMS:  At baseline today. Agitated, anxious overnight.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definitely contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Will start  home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: Hematuria improved. Ongoing moderately high blood loss
   in urine, initially thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume
   concerning for other process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R
   ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed

   dependent areas
   - Appears to be improving clinically
   - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, CVA with right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, productive cough, and on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). She also has a history of incarcerated hernia repair and failure to wean.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which may contribute to worsening respiratory status. She is currently on IV diltiazem to control heart rate and will be transitioned to PO diltiazem once she passes the speech and swallow evaluation.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to multifactorial causes including chronic hypercarbia, excess volume, and infection. She requires continued NPPV and monitoring with serial ABGs.
3. Possible Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She is being treated with linezolid and aztreonam for a total of 10-13 days. She also requires ongoing noninvasive ventilation as needed.
4. UTI/Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, initially thought to be a simple UTI, but now considered a more concerning process given the volume of blood loss. She is"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, CVA with right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI), presenting with increasingly productive cough. The patient has a tracheostomy and failed weaning from mechanical ventilation. She is also experiencing lethargy/ams (altered mental status), atrial fibrillation, UTI/hematuria, low urine output, rash, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 115/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals a sinus tachycardia, irregular rhythm, and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or guarding, and the peripheral vascular examination shows severe peripheral vascular disease of the left lower extremity with dark skin but no drainage.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), bipolar disorder, and chronic respiratory failure. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of bronchopneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. The main issue today is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR).

The patient's respiratory failure has improved significantly, and she no longer requires noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). She is being treated with continuous linezolid and aztreonam. It is suspected that her baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is around 80, indicating that she is likely at baseline levels. Her mental status is good today.

For the afib/RVR, intravenous diltiazem will be given, and non-invasive blood pressures will be monitored. If she passes the speech and swallow evaluation, she can start taking oral diltiazem.

The patient's hypertension is being managed by holding hydralazine due to lower blood pressures in the setting of afib.

Physical examination findings include tachycardia, irreg/irreg, diminished breath sounds throughout the chest, trace bilateral lower extremity edema, and black, hyperkeratotic changes on the lower extremities. The patient appears comfortable and convers"

   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with productive cough, now significantly improved, completely off NPPV.
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF now resolved on dilt gtt. No history of AF
   per documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 pr.  Was given lopressor
   , however may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE
   negative. TSH normal.
   - Starting diltiazem drip titrated to HR <110, SBP >80
   - Transition to PO diltiazem pending passing speech and swallow
   evaluation today.
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam for total of [**10-13**] days
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat > 92%
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   - Lasix 20mg IV x1 today, follow UOP for goal euvolemic
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Speech and swallow evaluation today
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Lethargy/AMS:  At baseline today. Agitated, anxious overnight.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definitely contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Will start  home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: Hematuria improved. Ongoing moderately high blood loss
   in urine, initially thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume
   concerning for other process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R
   ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - QD hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of -500cc today.
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
   - Appears to be improving clinically
   - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with increasingly productive cough, on NPPV much of the time.
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF now resolved on dilt gtt. No history of AF
   per documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 pr.  Was given lopressor
   , however may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE
   negative. TSH normal.
   - Starting diltiazem drip titrated to HR <110, SBP >80
   - Transition to PO diltiazem pending passing speech and swallow
   evaluation today.
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam for total of [**10-13**] days
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat > 92%
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   - Lasix 20mg IV x1 today, follow UOP for goal euvolemic
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Speech and swallow evaluation today
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Lethargy/AMS:  At baseline today. Agitated, anxious overnight.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definitely contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Will start  home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: Hematuria improved. Ongoing moderately high blood loss
   in urine, initially thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume
   concerning for other process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R
   ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - QD hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of -500cc today.
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
   - Appears to be improving clinically
   - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and urinary incontinence. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI), productive of cough on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). She also has a history of incarcerated hernia repair and failure to wean. Her recent events include becoming dry, desaturating to 89%, and requiring a steam mask. She converted to sinus rhythm after starting diltiazem drip and has remained in sinus rhythm on dilt gtt since. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Ms. [Known Lastname] has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The cause is suspected to be multifactorial, including chronic hypercarbia at baseline, excess volume, and infection. She continues to have radiographic evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray (CXR). Her baseline bicarbonate level was 30, and it increased to 38 on admission. No evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) was found on computed tomography angiography (CTA). She underwent tracheostomy in [4/2096] for incarcerated hernia repair and failure to wean. It is unclear if she has an increased"

   24 Hour Events:
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] did well yesterday, breathing comfortably on Nasal Canula all
   day. This morning she became a little bit dry and started to desat to
   89%, went up to 6L but only got to 92%, so started a steam mask.
   She had a speech and swallow eval which was indeterminate, suggesting a
   video speech and swallow eval. She has remained NPO pending her further
   study.
   In terms of her rhythm, she converted to SR yesterday after starting a
   dilt drip and has remained in NSR on dilt gtt since.

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with productive cough, now significantly improved, completely off NPPV.
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF now resolved on dilt gtt. No history of AF
   per documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 pr.  Was given lopressor
   , however may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE
   negative. TSH normal.
   - Started diltiazem drip titrated to HR <110, SBP >80. Will titrate to
   IV dilt today, and PO if tolerating PO meds
   - Transition to PO diltiazem pending passing speech and swallow
   evaluation today.
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Unclear if aspiration risk but on po diet at NS.  Ammonia level
   has come down since stopping depakote.  Failed S&S test.
   - Continue linezolid/aztreonam for total of [**10-13**] days
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat > 92%
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   - Lasix 20mg IV x1 today, follow UOP for goal euvolemic
   - PFTs and negative inspiratory force as out-patient to evaluate
   respiratory muscle function.
   - F/U culture
   - Continue noninvasive ventilation as needed
   - Social work consult and family meeting to discuss goals of care
   # Nutritional Status:  Failed speech and swallow and has refused
   Dobhoff/PEG.  Discussed TPN, however this is not an effective bridge to
   a definitive therapy.
   -  Speech and swallow evaluation today
   - Continue to discuss with family
   # Lethargy/AMS:  At baseline today. Agitated, anxious overnight.
   Present work-up notable for +UA (with history of Cipro-R E.coli) and
   CXR which appears more volume over-loaded than true PNA.  Afebrile,
   without leukocytosis.  Family notes h/o coughing.  Could also consider
   aspiration, viral vs atypicals.  Also with hypercarbia that is
   definitely contributing. Resolved with improvement in respiratory
   status.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Will start  home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Holding depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   - Ammonia level normalized now. Suspect adverse effect from Depakote
   - Monitor with serial ABGs
   # UTI/HEMATURIA: Hematuria improved. Ongoing moderately high blood loss
   in urine, initially thought [**2-1**] to simple UTI but given volume
   concerning for other process. No clots. Denying complaints. h/o Cipro-R
   ecoli.
   - defer more extensive w/u to outpatient provided pt remains stable
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   - QD hct checks
   - f/u urine cx
   - Outpatient urology w/u
   # Low urine output
 Improved on Lasix
   - Continue Lasix with goal of even today.
   # RASH: likely drug reaction, back appears somewhat more red in
   dependent areas
   - Appears to be improving clinically
   - continue to monitor and consider derm consult if worsening
   # Hypertension: On Diltiazem as outpatient, currently being held given
   pressures.
   - Holding Dilt, but can restart if Pt tachycardic or hypertensive
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient.
    - Hold medications for AMS, plan to restart as able.
    - Check Depakote level; holding risperdal and depakote.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place

","Based on the provided information, the patient has a complex medical history and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but there are several significant events mentioned in the progress note.

1. Respiratory Status: The patient had acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and a probable urinary tract infection (UTI) with productive cough. They were previously on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) but are now off it. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) was at 89% this morning, indicating hypoxemia, which improved with the use of a steam mask. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.29, indicating respiratory acidosis.

2. Cardiac Status: The patient has a history of hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. They were on IV diltiazem and are currently on PO diltiazem. The heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm (SR) since starting the diltiazem drip.

3. Neurological Status: The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right hemiplegia and is alert, oriented, and without new focal deficits.

4. Gastrointestinal Status: The patient has diverticulosis and has experienced lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) in the past. They are NPO pending further study, such as a speech and swallow evaluation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic hypertension, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), bipolar disorder, and chronic respiratory failure. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of bronchioalveolar lavage (BLL) pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. The main issue today is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/RVR).

The patient's respiratory failure has improved, and she is currently on continuous intravenous (IV) linezolid and aztreonam for 14 days. Her mental status is good today.

The plan is to try to wean off IV diltiazem, a heart rate medication, and consider switching to oral diltiazem if she passes a video swallow test. However, it is likely that the patient will need a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition due to her impaired swallowing.

Other medical issues include hypertension, for which hydralazine is being held due to lower blood pressures in the setting of AFIB. A video swallow test will be conducted today to assess her ability to swallow.

The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. She is also on mechanical ventilation and has"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with productive cough, now significantly improved, completely off NPPV.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in 5/99 [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Now s/p linezolid/aztreonam.
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat in low 90s
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   # Nutritional Status: Failed video speech and swallow. Pt amenable to
   PEG but not any oral or nasal tube.
    - Finalize plans with family at meeting today
   - page speech prior to meeting as they can be involved to comment on
   the studies done
    - No TPN for now
   # Lethargy/AMS: Mostly now at baseline, occasionally agitated at times.
   Original AMS likely multifactorial including infectious, hypercarbic.
   Now resolved. Ammonia level has come down since stopping depakote.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Continue home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Continue to hold depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF now resolved. No history of AF per
   documentation. Off of IV Diltiazem drip.  Was given lopressor , however
   may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE negative. TSH
   normal.
   - Would ideally rate control her with PO meds
 revisit this once PEG
   placed
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   [image004.jpg]
   # UTI/Hematuria: Hematuria had improved, but now continues.  Completed
   antibiotic course.  Likely needs outpatient follow up for work up of
   possible urinary malignancy
   - continue to monitor
   - f/u urine cytology
   # Low urine output: Intermittent, generally improved on Lasix, but
   overall not staying even.
   -          Goal is even today
 will not diurese
   [image006.jpg]
   [image008.jpg]
   # Rash: resolved. Was likely drug reaction with mild erythematous rash
   across chest and back. Likely drug reaction thought most likely to
   meropenem, which was added to her allergy list.
   # Hypertension: On diltiazem as outpatient, was on dilt gtt inpatient,
   now off.
   - restart PO dilt once feeding tube resolved
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient, now off
   depakote (added to allergies due to concern for high ammonia levels).
   Restarted risperdal. Using Zydis (SL zyprexa) prn.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, diurese, replete electrolytes, NPO pending PEG tube
   placement
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, CVA with right hemiplegia, PVD, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), and poor nutritional status.
- She underwent tracheostomy in 1999 for incarcerated hernia repair and failed weaning.
- Her current condition shows significant improvement, with complete resolution of hypercarbic respiratory failure, UTI, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. The patient's mental status has also improved.
- She failed the video speech and swallow evaluation and is amenable to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) but not any oral or nasal tube.
- She has a history of diverticulosis, bipolar disorder, and urinary incontinence. She is known to have chronic venous stasis changes and Proteus wound infections due to peripheral vascular disease.
- The patient's lab results show normal electrolyte levels, slightly elevated white blood cell count, and decreased platelet count. Her ammonia level has decreased since stopping Depakote.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 124/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [**age**]-year-old female admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient has a history of obesity, atrial fibrillation, and depression. On admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She required vasopressor support for hemodynamic instability.

Since admission, the patient has completed a course of antibiotics, including linezolid and aztreonam. The patient's condition has improved, but she still requires continued ICU care.

24-hour events include failed speech and swallow evaluation, with a speech and swallow specialist attending a family meeting tomorrow. The patient's fluid intake and output are being monitored closely, as well as her renal function. The patient is receiving gentle maintenance fluids and has had her A-line pulled.

The patient's allergies include ciprofloxacin, penicillins, Percocet, meropenem, Ativan, and Depakote. Her last doses of antibiotics were given on [**2107-3-15**] at 04:19 PM for aztreonam and 06:38 PM for linezolid.

Infusions include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient is also on several other medications for her various conditions.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with productive cough, now significantly improved, completely off NPPV.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in [**4-/2096**] [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Now s/p linezolid/aztreonam.
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat > 92%
   - Lasix 20mg IV x1 today, follow UOP for goal euvolemic
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   # Nutritional Status: Failed video speech and swallow. Pt amenable to
   PEG but not any oral or nasal tube.
    - Finalize plans with family at meeting today
    - No TPN for now
   # Lethargy/AMS: Mostly now at baseline, occasionally agitated at times.
   Original AMS likely multifactorial including infectious, hypercarbic.
   Now resolved. Ammonia level has come down since stopping depakote.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Continue home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Continue to hold depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF now resolved on dilt gtt. No history of AF
   per documentation. On IV dilt 10 q6 if HR>160 pr.  Was given lopressor
   , however may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE
   negative. TSH normal.
   - Started diltiazem drip titrated to HR <110, SBP >80. Will titrate to
   IV dilt today, and PO if tolerating PO meds
   - Transition to PO diltiazem pending passing speech and swallow
   evaluation today.
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   [image004.jpg]
   # UTI/Hematuria: Hematuria resolved. Initial concern for other process
   (potential malignancy) given ongoing hematuria but now resolved. Of
   note, pt with h/o Cipro-R ecoli.
   - if returns, outpatient workup by urology would be appropriate
   - continue Aztreo/Linezolid
   - intermittent irrigation as needed
   # Low urine output: Intermittent, generally improved on Lasix, but
   overall not staying even.
   -          Continue Lasix with goal of even today, will likely need [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing
   [image006.jpg]
   [image008.jpg]
   # Rash: resolved. Was likely drug reaction with mild erythematous rash
   across chest and back. Likely drug reaction thought most likely to
   meropenem, which was added to her allergy list.
   # Hypertension: On diltiazem as outpatient, was on dilt gtt inpatient,
   now off.
   - restart PO dilt once feeding tube resolved
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient, now off
   depakote (added to allergies due to concern for high ammonia levels).
   Restarted risperdal. Using Zydis (SL zyprexa) prn.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, CVA with right hemiplegia, PVD, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI. The patient has shown significant improvement and is now off nasal positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). She has a tracheostomy in place and was previously on linezolid/aztreonam antibiotics.

The patient's current condition includes lethargy/ams (now at baseline), atrial fibrillation (resolved), UTI/hematuria (resolved), low urine output, rash (resolved), and hypertension. She also has chronic venous stasis changes and Proteus wound infections in her peripheral vascular disease, diverticulosis, s/p CVA (unclear deficit), urinary incontinence, and bipolar disorder.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 124/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89% on a nasal cannula. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.30, pCO2 of 83, pO2 of 55, HCO3 of 43, and base excess of 10.

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 6.2 K/uL"

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, hypertension, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in residual right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and bipolar disorder. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure due to presumed aspiration in the setting of bronchopneumonia.

The patient's respiratory failure has improved, and she has been receiving continuous intravenous antibiotics (linezolid and aztreonam) for pneumonia. Her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) has resolved, and she is now in sinus rhythm. Her blood pressure is currently within normal limits.

The patient has failed videofluoroscopy swallow study, indicating difficulty with swallowing and requires intermittent suctioning of oral secretions. She is expected to be called out to the floor later today, but initially, the family will be met to discuss the possibility of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

The patient has multiple medical complications including abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension (ACS), impaired skin integrity, airway clearance impairment, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired transfers, alteration in nutrition, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

It is important to note that the patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and her current disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with productive cough, now significantly improved, completely off NPPV.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in 5/99 [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Now s/p linezolid/aztreonam.
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat in low 90s
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   # Nutritional Status: Failed video speech and swallow. PEG tube planned
   for today vs tomorrow.
   - No TPN for now
   # Anxiety: patient with known history of mental illness with recently
   stopped mood stabilizing medication exhibiting signs of intermittent
   anxiety with tachycardia, tachypnea and distress without clearly
   identifiable other causes and noteably triggered by stressful events
    - psych consult
   # Lethargy/AMS: Mostly now at baseline, occasionally agitated at times.
   Original AMS likely multifactorial including infectious, hypercarbic.
   Now resolved. Ammonia level has come down since stopping depakote.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Continue home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Continue to hold depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF now resolved. No history of AF per
   documentation. Off of IV Diltiazem drip.  Was given lopressor , however
   may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE negative. TSH
   normal.
   - Would ideally rate control her with PO meds
 revisit this once PEG
   placed
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   # UTI/Hematuria: Hematuria had improved, but now continues. Completed
   antibiotic course.  Likely needs outpatient follow up for work up of
   possible urinary malignancy
   - continue to monitor
   - f/u urine cytology
   # Low urine output: Intermittent, generally improved on Lasix, but
   overall not staying even.
    - Goal is even today
 will not diurese
   # Rash: resolved. Was likely drug reaction with mild erythematous rash
   across chest and back. Likely drug reaction thought most likely to
   meropenem, which was added to her allergy list.
   # Hypertension: On diltiazem as outpatient, was on dilt gtt inpatient,
   now off.
   - restart PO dilt once feeding tube resolved
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient, now off
   depakote (added to allergies due to concern for high ammonia levels).
   Restarted risperdal. Using Zydis (SL zyprexa) prn.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, diurese, replete electrolytes, NPO pending PEG tube
   placement

   Had family meeting - agreed to PEG. Surgery consulted, will plan to do
   today vs tomorrow most likely. in afternoon desated a bit to low 80s,
   pCO2 105, suctioning, c/f new aspiration but stat CXR not
   overwhelmingly impressive. On BiPAP for a few hours then stopped
   because difficulty handing it, sats ~90, heavy secretions, blood
   tinged. Tried to call daughter three times to update her on status but
   no answer.
   Spent most of the night in the low 90s. Around 2am was tachy to 113,
   noted to be bleeding a little from SQH injection sites, ongoing
   hematuria. Hct stable. 3am was tachypneic and put back on bipap. Calmed
   down with slow breathing but noted to have rapid shallow breaths on top
   of her more deliberate slower breaths.
   No new complaints this morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with productive cough, now significantly improved, completely off NPPV.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in 5/99 [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Now s/p linezolid/aztreonam.
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat in low 90s
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   # Nutritional Status: Failed video speech and swallow. PEG tube planned
   for today vs tomorrow.
   - No TPN for now
   # Anxiety: patient with known history of mental illness with recently
   stopped mood stabilizing medication exhibiting signs of intermittent
   anxiety with tachycardia, tachypnea and distress without clearly
   identifiable other causes and noteably triggered by stressful events
    - psych consult
   # Lethargy/AMS: Mostly now at baseline, occasionally agitated at times.
   Original AMS likely multifactorial including infectious, hypercarbic.
   Now resolved. Ammonia level has come down since stopping depakote.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Continue home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Continue to hold depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF now resolved. No history of AF per
   documentation. Off of IV Diltiazem drip.  Was given lopressor , however
   may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. CE negative. TSH
   normal.
   - Would ideally rate control her with PO meds
 revisit this once PEG
   placed
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   # UTI/Hematuria: Hematuria had improved, but now continues. Completed
   antibiotic course.  Likely needs outpatient follow up for work up of
   possible urinary malignancy
   - continue to monitor
   - f/u urine cytology
   # Low urine output: Intermittent, generally improved on Lasix, but
   overall not staying even.
    - Goal is even today
 will not diurese
   # Rash: resolved. Was likely drug reaction with mild erythematous rash
   across chest and back. Likely drug reaction thought most likely to
   meropenem, which was added to her allergy list.
   # Hypertension: On diltiazem as outpatient, was on dilt gtt inpatient,
   now off.
   - restart PO dilt once feeding tube resolved
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient, now off
   depakote (added to allergies due to concern for high ammonia levels).
   Restarted risperdal. Using Zydis (SL zyprexa) prn.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, diurese, replete electrolytes, NPO pending PEG tube
   placement

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bipolar disorder, and previous strokes. She was admitted to the ICU with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and a probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has shown significant improvement, and her NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) has been discontinued.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic hypercarbia, and her baseline bicarbonate level was 30. She also had an acute exacerbation of respiratory failure, which could be multifactorial including excess volume, infection, or chronic hypercarbia. No evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) was found on computed tomography angiography (CTA).

2. Nutritional Status: The patient failed a video speech and swallow test, indicating an inability to eat normally. As a result, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is planned for today or tomorrow. Temporary parenteral nutrition (TPN) is not recommended at this time.

3. Anxiety: The patient, who has a known history of mental illness and recently stopped mood stabilizing medication, exhibited signs of intermittent anxiety with tachycardia, tachypnea, and distress. This appears to be triggered by stressful events. A psychiatric consultation is planned.

4. Lethargy/Amnesias: The patient's original mental status changes were likely multifactorial including infectious and hypercarbic causes. These have now resolved, and ammonia levels have decreased since stopping depakote. The patient is to continue taking Zydis and risperdal (an occasional dose), but depakote will be held due to mental status changes and elevated ammonia levels.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had a new onset of atrial fibrillation, which has since resolved. No history of atrial fibrillation was documented. The patient was taken off IV diltiazem and given lopressor, which may have contributed to worsening respiratory status. Cardiac enzymes were negative, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were normal. Rate control with oral medications is desired once a feeding tube is in place.

6. UTI/Hematuria: Although hematuria had improved, it continues. The patient completed an antibiotic course, and it is likely that she will need outpatient follow-up for further evaluation of possible urinary malignancy. Monitoring and follow-up urine cytology are recommended.

7. Low Urine Output: The patient's urine output is intermittent and generally improved with Lasix. However, overall, the output is not even, and diuresis is not desired.

8. Rash: The patient had a resolved rash that was likely a drug reaction. It presented as an erythematous rash across the chest"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but there are several notable events that occurred within a 24-hour period.

The patient's family meeting was held to discuss the option of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. Surgery was called, possibly for tomorrow. In the afternoon, the patient's pCO2 levels were low in the 80s, and suctioning was performed due to new aspiration. A chest X-ray was done but did not show any impressive findings. The patient was placed on BiPAP for a few hours but stopped due to difficulty handling it. Afterward, the patient's oxygen saturation (sats) were around 90%, and heavy blood-tinged secretions were observed. The patient's condition remained stable in the low 90s most of the night.

At 2 am, the patient experienced tachycardia with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute and was noted to be bleeding slightly from the subcutaneous injection sites. Ongoing hematuria was also reported, and it was decided to check the morning labs with a focus on hematocrit (Hct) levels.

The patient has several allergies, including ciprofloxacin, penicillins, Percocet (oxycodone Hcl/acetaminophen), meropenem, and Ativan (lorazepam). The last doses of antibiotics, aztreonam and linezolid, were administered on [**2107-3-15**] at 4:19 pm and 6:38 pm, respectively.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius (96.5 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/62 mmHg to 142/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,022 mL, including 550 mL of intravenous fluids. The total output consists of 402 mL of urine and 140 mL of blood products. The respiratory support indicates the use of BiPAP with a fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals general obesity, clear breath sounds with transmitted upper airway noises, and a faint systolic murmur. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, place, and person, but is unable to recall the absence of their clock. Movement, tone, and sensation assessments are not performed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.1 K"

   24 Hour Events:
   Had family meeting - agreed to PEG. Surgery consulted, will plan to do
   today vs tomorrow most likely. in afternoon desated a bit to low 80s,
   pCO2 105, suctioning, c/f new aspiration but stat CXR not
   overwhelmingly impressive. On BiPAP for a few hours then stopped
   because difficulty handing it, sats ~90, heavy secretions, blood
   tinged. Tried to call daughter three times to update her on status but
   no answer.
   Spent most of the night in the low 90s. Around 2am was tachy to 113,
   noted to be bleeding a little from SQH injection sites, ongoing
   hematuria. Hct stable. 3am was tachypneic and put back on bipap. Calmed
   down with slow breathing but noted to have rapid shallow breaths on top
   of her more deliberate slower breaths.
   No new complaints this morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   78F HTN, CVA c R hemiplegia, PVD, bipolar d/o admitted with
   acute-on-chronic hypercarbic [**Year (4 digits) 2893**] failure and probable UTI, PNA
   with productive cough, now significantly improved, completely off NPPV.
   # Hypercarbic [**Year (4 digits) **] Failure: Acute on chronic. Suspect
   multifactorial including chronic hypercarbia at baseline +/- excess
   volume +/- infection. Continues to have radiographic e/o PNA on CXR.
   Baseline HCO3 30, 38 on admission. No evidence of PE on CTA. s/p
   tracheostomy in 5/99 [**2-1**] incarcerated hernia repair and failure to
   wean. Now s/p linezolid/aztreonam.
   - Continue NC as needed, maintain O2 sat in low 90s
   - Acquire ABG based on worsening mental status and O2 sat <92%, CO2 <90
   - 20 IV lasix this AM, with goal I/O -500 mL to -1L, will recheck PM
   lyes
   - Will restart linezolid/aztreonam given worsening [**Month/Day (2) 2893**] status
   and concern for possible PNA
   .
   # Nutritional Status: Failed video speech and swallow. PEG tube planned
   for today vs tomorrow.
   - No TPN for now
   # Anxiety: patient with known history of mental illness with recently
   stopped mood stabilizing medication exhibiting signs of intermittent
   anxiety with tachycardia, tachypnea and distress without clearly
   identifiable other causes and noteably triggered by stressful events
    - will consider psych consult once MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2893**] status improved
   # Lethargy/AMS: Mostly now at baseline, occasionally agitated at times.
   Original AMS likely multifactorial including infectious, hypercarbic.
   Now resolved. Ammonia level has come down since stopping depakote.
   - Continue Zydis; will not give Ativan.
   - Continue home risperdal dose given occasional anxiety
   - Continue to hold depakote given MS changes and elevated ammonia level
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Platelets trending down.
   - Will hold heparin for now, and restart with [**Hospital1 **] heparin
   - Will check hemolysis labs, DIC labs
   - Will recheck CBC this PM
   .
   # Atrial Fibrilation: new AF now resolved. No history of AF per
   documentation. Off of IV Diltiazem drip.  Was given lopressor , however
   may have contributed to worsening [**Hospital1 2893**] status. CE negative. TSH
   normal.
   - Would ideally rate control her with PO meds
 revisit this once PEG
   placed
   - Given history of strokes, will discuss anticoagulation; holding off
   now because may get PEG
   .
   # UTI/Hematuria: Hematuria had improved, but now continues. Completed
   antibiotic course.  Likely needs outpatient follow up for work up of
   possible urinary malignancy
   - continue to monitor
   - f/u urine cytology
   # Low urine output: Intermittent, generally improved on Lasix, but
   overall not staying even.
    - Goal is even today
 will not diurese
   # Rash: resolved. Was likely drug reaction with mild erythematous rash
   across chest and back. Likely drug reaction thought most likely to
   meropenem, which was added to her allergy list.
   # Hypertension: On diltiazem as outpatient, was on dilt gtt inpatient,
   now off.
   - restart PO dilt once feeding tube resolved
   - Can give 10 IV hydralazine q6h for HTN
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient known chronic venous stasis
   changes & Proteus wound infections.
    - Monitor, lotion [**Hospital1 **]
   # Bipolar disorder: On Risperdal / Depakote as outpatient, now off
   depakote (added to allergies due to concern for high ammonia levels).
   Restarted risperdal. Using Zydis (SL zyprexa) prn.
   # Diverticulosis: Patient h/o LGIB in [**2104**].  No c/o of pain at this
   time to indicate inflammation.
    - No e/o bleeding at this time
    - Continue bowel regimen
    - Monitor Hct
   # s/p CVA: Unclear what deficit remains and patient unable to provide
   further history.  Per family, unable to move R arm and not ambulatory
    - Extensive Neuro exam once patient less lethargic
   # Urinary Incontinence: At baseline.
    - Foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, diurese, replete electrolytes, NPO pending PEG tube
   placement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease, bipolar disorder, diverticulosis, and urinary incontinence. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of lethargy and agitation. She has shown improvement since stopping mood-stabilizing medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline hypercarbia has contributed to her respiratory failure. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIPPV) have been attempted, but the patient remains significantly improved and off NIPPV.
2. Possible pneumonia (PNA): The patient has radiographic evidence of PNA on chest X-ray. She is currently on antibiotics, but her condition is worsening, and there is a concern for possible PNA.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, and she is at risk for bleeding complications. Heparin therapy has been held, and there is a plan to restart with a different type of heparin. Further evaluation for hemolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) will be conducted.
4. Anxiety and agitation: The patient exhibits signs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of aspiration, tachypnea, bleeding from SQH injection sites, ongoing hematuria, and difficulty handling BiPAP. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 at 50%, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 94%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate indicate potential respiratory complications. The use of BiPAP and mechanical ventilation suggests the need for close monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support.
2. Bleeding/Hematuria: The patient's bleeding from SQH injection sites and ongoing hematuria may indicate coagulation abnormalities or renal dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Infection: The elevated WBC count and abnormal differential could suggest an ongoing infection. The patient's history of aspiration increases the risk of pneumonia. Cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] continued to have respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hypercarbia over the course of the day.  She was on and off NIPPV over
   the course of the day as well.  Given suspicion that she was volume
   overloaded with worsening bilateral effusions, diuresis was attempted,
   first with Lasix boluses and then with a Lasix drip.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **]
   daughter was informed of her worsening status earlier in the day and
   was in to see her mother in the afternoon.  I met with her at the
   bedside to update her and she received ongoing updates from the team
   before she departed.  At approx 6PM, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had an acute
   desaturation to the 50s.  Ambu bagging was initiated but ventilation
   was difficult with poor air movement.  Attempt to suction her airway
   were not successful in retrieving any plug.  She continued to
   desaturate further followed by bradycardia and loss of pulse.  Given
   her explicit DNR/DNI status, CPR or endotracheal intubation was not
   pursued.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] expired at 6:20PM.  Attempts to contact either her
   daughter or other family members have been unsuccessful up to this
   point.
