   middle and lower lobes, and the lingula, with extension of embolic
   material
   into multiple peripheral vessels supplying both lungs. There are
   prominent
   subsegmental PE in vessels supplying the posterior left lower lobe.
   2. Enlarged right ventricle and straightened intraventricular septum
   consistent with right heart strain. No pulmonary infarct at this time.
   3. Heterogeneous peribronchovascular nodules in the left upper lobe,
   could
   reflect hemorrhage or infectious etiology. Unlikely to represent
   infarct.
   Recommend re-imaging after treatment for PE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of alcohol and opiate abuse, breast cancer, depression, chemotherapy neuropathy, and hypertension. She was found unresponsive and diagnosed with large bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA). The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has red skin, tender left calf, bilateral edema, and warm extremities. Her labs show elevated troponin T levels. Imaging results reveal multiple segmental PE in both lungs, prominent subsegmental PE in the posterior left lower lobe, and enlarged right ventricle with straightened intraventricular septum consistent with right heart strain. The patient has been started on anticoagulation with lovenox, antibiotics for CAP, and steroids for COPD flare. She is also receiving nebulizers as well as prn, oxycodone for pain management, and social work consult for alcohol/opiate abuse and depression. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - The patient has already been diagnosed with large bilateral PEs, which can lead to further complications such as hypoxia, respiratory distress, right heart strain, and potentially death if not managed properly.
2. Left Upper Lobe Pneumonia (LUL PNA) - The patient's LUL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a history of large bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA), and a history of alcohol and opiate abuse. She is currently hemodynamically stable but has experienced recent anxiety, hypoxia, and withdrawal symptoms. The patient's medical history includes breast cancer, depression, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and hypertension. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, pain management, and psychiatric support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has extensive bilateral PEs with hypoxia easily correctable on nasal cannula, but overall hemodynamic stability. The source of the PEs is likely from heparin, guaiac stools, or another underlying cause. Close monitoring of Troponin & BNP every 12 hours, an echocardiogram today, and consideration of lysis if unstable are necessary. Type & screen should be active, and a bilateral lower extremity ultrasound should confirm the source. If the patient has deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a filter may be considered.

2. Hypoxia: Combination of PE and Pneumonia, the patient is setting well on NC 5L. Follow sats, goal >90%, and ABG with any change in clinical status. Continue CTX/Azithro for community-acquired"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of alcohol and opiate abuse, who was found unresponsive and diagnosed with large bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA). She is currently hemodynamically stable and receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The source of the PE is likely from heparin, guaiac stools, or an underlying deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's other medical conditions include a history of breast cancer, depression, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, hypertension, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has extensive bilateral PEs with hypoxia easily correctable on NC, but is overall hemodynamically stable. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and frequent ABGs will be necessary. Consider lysis if unstable, but currently not indicated. Type & screen active, bilateral LE u/s to confirm source, and filter if she has DVT.
2. Hypoxia: Combination of PE and Pneumonia, patient is saturating well on NC 5L. Follow sats, goal >90%. ABG with change in clinical status.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of a LUL PNA on outside hospital CXR, positive sputum. Afebrile with no leukocytosis. F/U Blood/sputum cx, continue CTX/Azith"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman who was found unresponsive and diagnosed with large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and a left upper lobe pneumonia (PNA). She has a history of alcohol and opiate abuse and is currently being treated for anxiety, PE, hypoxia, pneumonia, alcohol/opiate abuse, breast cancer, depression, chemotherapy neuropathy, and hypertension. She is receiving various medications and treatments, including heparin, antibiotics, and pain management. The patient is currently in the ICU and her code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has extensive bilateral PEs, which can lead to further complications such as right heart strain, hypoxia, and potentially death if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia (LUL PNA): The patient has evidence of a left upper lobe pneumonia, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of secondary infections.
3. Alcohol/Opiate Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol and opiate abuse and is currently on oxycodone for pain control to avoid withdrawal. If not managed appropriately, she may experience withdrawal symptoms.
4. Breast Cancer: The patient has a history of breast cancer, and her treatment may be affected by her current clotting risk. This could potentially impact her overall prognosis and management.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and pulmonary embolism. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia and decreased mental status. CT scan confirmed bilateral pulmonary embolisms, and she has been on heparin drip. Currently, she is on low-dose oxygen and her hemodynamic stability is maintained. The patient switched from heparin to Enoxaparin (Lovenox) overnight. She also experiences sweating and anxiety, which were managed by increasing the dose of narcotics. The patient has a history of chronic ethanol and opioid use. She underwent an ultrasound and trans-thoracic echo overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization: The patient's critical condition may lead to prolonged immobilization, increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and potential complications.
2. Respiratory distress: Due to her history of smoking and the presence of bilateral pulmonary embolisms, the patient is at risk of developing respiratory distress, requiring close monitoring and appropriate interventions.
3. Bleeding: As the patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), there is a risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary to ensure the appropriate balance between preventing further thrombotic events and avoiding bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and is receiving antibiotic therapy. Close attention should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of alcohol and opiate abuse, who was found unresponsive with large bilateral pulmonary emboli (PE) and left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA). She is currently in the ICU and requires 6 liters of nasal cannula (NC) to maintain oxygen saturation in the low 90s. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 139/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has red skin, wheezes in all lung fields, tender left calf, bilateral edema, and warm extremities without cyanosis. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient has several medical conditions including chronic pain, hypertension, anxiety, pulmonary embolism, breast cancer, depression, chemotherapy neuropathy, and hypertension. The plan includes continuing anticoagulation, antibiotics, steroids, nebulizers, and monitoring for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization and bed rest may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE.
2. The patient's history of alcohol and opiate abuse can lead to complications such as withdrawal symptoms or exacerbation of underlying liver or kidney disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of chronic pain, hypertension, anxiety, pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, reactive airway disease, alcohol/opiate abuse, breast cancer, and depression. She was found unresponsive with large bilateral PEs and a left upper lobe pneumonia. She is currently on supplemental oxygen, enoxaparin for PE, ceftriaxone and azithromycin for pneumonia, steroids for reactive airway disease, oxycodone and oxycontin for alcohol/opiate abuse, and pail for depression. Her blood pressure is elevated, and she has bilateral edema. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and elevated troponin-T levels. She is awake, alert, and oriented but has tender skin, wheezing in all lung fields, tender left calf, and warm extremities without cyanosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, indicating a risk of hypotension if antihypertensive medications are not managed properly.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of bilateral PEs, which could be a complication of DVT. She also has a tender left calf, which may suggest the presence of DVT.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for pneumonia, but there is a risk of worsening or developing new infections"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, admitted to the ICU with a pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia (PNA), and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently receiving enoxaparin for PE, antibiotics for PNA, and a steroid course with nebulizers for COPD exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/72 to 167/131 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. Physical examination shows wheezing throughout the lungs and trace edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's blood glucose level is well-controlled. She has a history of ethanol abuse and opiate withdrawal but does not exhibit any withdrawal symptoms currently. The patient's condition has improved, with less coughing and wheezing.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobilization in the ICU and history of PE. Enoxaparin has been initiated for systemic anticoagulation.
2. Pneumonia (PNA) progression: Although the patient is currently improving, there is still a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress due to pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, and probable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and opioid dependence. He is currently receiving enoxaparin for PE, azithromycin and ceftriaxone for pneumonia, and standing bronchodilators and prednisone burst for possible COPD exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are stable with normal heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. He is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, wheezing throughout the chest, trace lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin T levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor with continued treatment for PE, pneumonia, and possible COPD exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed case of pneumonia, which may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of sepsis, and potential need for more aggressive antibiotic treatment.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms and diagnostic findings suggest a PE, which can cause respiratory distress, hypoxia, and potentially lead to further complications such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including chronic pain, hypertension, anxiety, pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, reactive airway disease, alcohol/opiate abuse, history of breast cancer, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU due to a large bilateral PE and left upper lobe pneumonia. The patient's hypoxia improved while awake but recurred during nebs. She received 20mg IV lasix and q1hr albuterol nebs for a few hours. The patient also fell while returning to her bed from the commode, but there was no loss of consciousness or head trauma. Her current vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate 85 bpm, blood pressure 135/87 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on nasal cannula. She is receiving enoxaparin for PE and continuing with supplemental oxygen as needed. Her blood work shows an elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T level. The patient's pain is being managed, and she is on various medications for her other conditions, including ceftriaxone and azithromycin for pneumonia, oxycodone and oxycontin for alcohol/opiate abuse, and paxil for depression. The patient has decided to wait for her husband's arrival before making a decision about intubation. She is currently awaiting transfer to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:
1. Worsening hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia improved while awake but recurred during nebs. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of oxygen delivery devices may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient is still receiving antibiotics for her left upper lobe pneumonia. It is important to monitor her respiratory status and response to treatment to prevent further deterioration.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of bilateral PEs, and she is receiving enoxaparin for anticoagulation. Regular monitoring of her coagulation status and assessment for any new DVTs are crucial.
4. Fall-related injuries: Although the patient did not sustain any head trauma or loss of consciousness during her fall, it is essential to assess her for any injuries, especially considering her risk factors such as alcohol/opiate abuse and decreased mobility.
5. Withdrawal symptoms: The patient has a history of alcohol/opiate abuse, and she is being managed with oxycodone and oxycontin. Monitoring for withdrawal symptoms and providing appropriate supportive care are important.
6. Breast cancer recurrence or complications: The patient has a history of breast cancer. Regular follow-up with her oncologist will be necessary to monitor for any recurrence or complications related to her previous cancer diagnosis.
7. Depression and anxiety management: The patient has a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. It is important to continue her antidepressant medication and provide emotional support during her recovery process."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including chronic pain, hypertension, anxiety, pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, alcohol/opiate abuse, breast cancer, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU due to large bilateral PEs and left upper lobe pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1 C (97°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 135/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her fluid balance is positive at +1.7 L, and she has received 20 mg of IV lasix. Nebulized albuterol has been given for a few hours.

Physical examination reveals red skin, worse with coughing, no jugular venous distention, supple neck, no lymphadenopathy, some left base crackles on chest examination, regular heart sounds without murmur, tender left calf, bilateral edema, warm extremities without cyanosis, and tender abdomen with guarding but without tense or rigid abdomen.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging studies show large bilateral PEs and a left upper lobe pneumonia.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing enoxaparin for PE, providing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including acute pulmonary embolism (PE), probable pneumonia (PNA), and possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving treatment for these conditions.

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for anxiety related to her pet dog's recent surgery.

The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and opioid dependence, for which she is currently receiving treatment. She also has anxiety, which is being managed with a consult for a social worker and possible low-dose Ativan on a prn basis.

In terms of laboratory results, the patient's hemoglobin level is 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 159 K/uL, and platelet count is 107 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated potassium at 5.2 mEq/L. The rest of the laboratory values appear to be within normal range.

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray taken on 02/12, 02/13, 02/14, and 02/15, which showed no significant changes. The patient's sputum culture on 02/12 showed an increased number of polymorphonuclear cells but no growth of bacteria. Her blood cultures have been negative to date.

The patient's physical examination reveals no remarkable findings except for anxious behavior and tearfulness when discussing her pet dog. Her extremities do not show any edema, and her skin is not assessed. Neurological examination is also incomplete.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD exacerbation, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization, and possible fall-related injuries given the patient's history of a fall overnight.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, administer appropriate bronchodilators for COPD management, provide adequate pain control, and ensure proper mobility to prevent further complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old overweight/obese male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, and opioid dependence, admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient's condition is complicated by acute pulmonary embolism (PE), possible pneumonia, and anxiety. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/87 to 177/135 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, elevated troponin T, and slightly elevated blood glucose. The patient's chest X-ray reveals left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - The patient's hypoxemic respiratory distress, along with the presence of risk factors such as obesity, immobilization, and history of COPD, suggest the possibility of PE. Enoxaparin has been initiated as part of the treatment plan.
2. Probable Pneumonia - The patient's symptoms, including fever, cough, and the chest X-ray findings of left lower lobe infiltrate, indicate the presence of pneumonia. Antibiotics (azithromycin and cef"
