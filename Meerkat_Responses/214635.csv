","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 19-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and ADHD who was found unresponsive by his mother. The empty bottles of clozapine and Robitussin were found next to him. The patient was intubated in the field and brought to the ICU. He is now extubated and agitated, with delirium.

Medical Complications:
1. Suicidal attempt: The patient's overdose on clozapine and Robitussin raises concerns about suicidal ideation.
2. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, which could be related to the overdose.
3. Fever: The patient has a fever, which may be due to infection or a side effect of the overdose.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status may have led to aspiration pneumonia.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection due to respiratory failure.
7. ECG changes: The patient has ECG changes, although they are not concerning for TCA overdose.
8. Meningitis: The patient's fever, seizure, and altered mental status raise concerns for meningitis.
9. Lithium toxicity: Although the patient's lithium level was negative, it should be monitored due to his history of lithium use.
10. Serotonin syndrome or NMS: The patient should be monitored for these conditions due to the overdose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient may experience respiratory distress due to aspiration pneumonia or further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing a serious infection due to his compromised immune system and potential aspiration pneumonia.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient may be at risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to ECG changes and the effects of the overdose.
4. Neurological complications: The patient may experience ongoing neurological complications, such as seizures or long-term cognitive impairment.
5. Liver or kidney damage: Overdose of medications like clozapine can potentially lead to liver or kidney damage.
6. Psychiatric complications: The patient may be at risk of developing psychiatric complications, including worsening of bipolar disorder symptoms or the development of new psychiatric conditions.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","The patient is a 19-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and ADHD who was found unresponsive by his mother. It is suspected that he intentionally overdosed on clozapine and robitussin. He was intubated in the field due to respiratory failure and later extubated. 

The patient is currently agitated and delirious. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He has been diagnosed with a seizure, suicidal behavior, and fever.

The assessment and plan include monitoring for evidence of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serial ECGs every 4 hours, a psychiatric consultation, a social worker consultation, and holding psychiatric medications. The patient also needs to be evaluated for meningitis, given the seizure and fever. A lumbar puncture was performed yesterday, which did not show any organisms in the cerebrospinal fluid. 

The patient is also at risk for aspiration pneumonia due to his altered mental status, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been discontinued while awaiting sputum culture results. Clindamycin has been started for the likely aspiration pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's mental health condition, development of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, aspiration pneumonia, meningitis, and electrolyte im"

","The patient is a 19-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and ADHD, found unresponsive by his mother at 6 am yesterday with empty bottles of Clozaril and Robitussin next to him. He was intubated in the field, now extubated and agitated and delirious. The patient had an overdose of Clozaril, a medication used for bipolar disorder, and Robitussin, which is a cough syrup that can be abused. The toxicology screen was negative, but there is concern for potential lithium toxicity as the patient has a history of taking lithium in the past.

The patient experienced a seizure, fever, and leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), which may indicate an infection such as meningitis. A lumbar puncture was performed to rule out meningitis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were discontinued, with the continuation of acyclovir for possible herpes simplex virus infection.

The patient also has aspiration pneumonia, likely related to altered mental status and somnolence due to the overdose. He was intubated for airway protection and is currently extubated. Clindamycin IV was started for the likely aspiration pneumonia, and the sputum culture will be followed up.

The patient's ECG changes were not concerning for tricyclic antidepressant overdose, so bicarbonate was discontinued.

The patient is agitated and kicking staff, so he is being placed in restraints for safety,"

- The patient is a 19-year-old male with bipolar disorder who was admitted with unresponsiveness, thought to be due to an overdose of clozapine and robitussin. He also had fever and seizure.
- The patient required intubation in the field and was re-intubated yesterday for severe agitation and airway protection.
- He is currently experiencing persistent tachycardia, problems with airway protection, excess secretions, and combative behavior. His ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2 of 50 mmHg, HCO3- of 26 mEq/L, and BE of -3.
- The patient has a fever of 104.4 degrees Celsius, and levofloxacin has been added to broaden coverage.
- The patient had swollen OP and arytenoids prior to last intubation, so a cuff check is recommended prior to extubation.
- The patient's allergies include cefaclor and unknown allergens.
- The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 10/10/2127 at 10:30 PM, levofloxacin on 10/11/2127 at 10:00 PM, acyclovir on 10/12/2127 at 03:30 AM, and clindamycin on 10/12/2127 at 04:00 AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 19-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder, admitted with unresponsiveness thought to be due to an overdose of clozapine (Clozaril) and Robitussin. The patient experienced fever, seizure, and was initially intubated in the field. He was re-intubated yesterday for severe agitation and airway protection. 

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, fever with leukocytosis, potential meningitis, and possible overdose of other medications. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with persistent tachycardia and elevated body temperature. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for airway protection, and various medications have been administered to manage agitation, infection, and seizures. Cultures have been obtained, and further investigations are planned to rule out meningitis and determine the cause of the fever and leukocytosis. 

The patient's mental status is still altered, and psychiatric consultation and social work consultation are recommended when the patient returns to normal mentation. The patient's electrolytes and glucose levels are within normal limits, but close monitoring is required due to the ongoing medical instability. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and CXR suggestive of airspace disease indicate a high suspicion for aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and failure, potentially requiring increased"

","The patient is a 19-year-old with bipolar disorder, admitted for unresponsiveness, thought to be due to a clozapine (Clozaril) overdose. The patient also has a fever and seizure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. They have been diagnosed with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL pna), confirmed by bronchoscopy and culture. The patient has a history of agitation and airway protection issues, leading to re-intubation. There is a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by spiking fevers and CXR findings. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and aspiration. The patient's seizure is believed to be related to the overdose and there is no prior history of seizures. Acyclovir has been initiated to rule out herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. ECG changes have stabilized, and prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition remains unstable, and further management will involve weaning off sedation, evaluating mental status, and considering extubation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 19-year-old with bipolar disorder who was admitted with unresponsiveness, thought to be related to a clozapine (clozaril) overdose, along with fever and seizure. The patient required intubation in the field.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of diffuse thick secretions, erythema, and friability in the left lower lobe (LLL). This condition requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and supportive care.

2. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which is common in patients with severe infections or systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Monitoring for changes in mental status and providing appropriate sedation management is important.

3. Hypoxemia: Due to the aspiration pneumonia and subsequent respiratory failure, the patient may continue to experience hypoxemia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and adjusting ventilator settings accordingly is necessary.

4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's lab results show electrolyte imbalances such as low potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels. These imbalances need to be corrected to maintain proper organ function.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 19-year-old with bipolar disorder, admitted with unresponsiveness thought to be due to a clozaril (and possibly other) overdose, fever, and seizure. The patient was intubated in the field and re-intubated on Saturday for severe agitation and airway protection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Delirium/confusion: The patient is agitated and delirious, which can be attributed to the overdose of psychotropic medication, hypoxemia, or infection.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels may drop due to pneumonia, aspiration, or respiratory failure.

3. Suicidality/suicide attempt: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and attempted suicide by overdosing on clozaril, an antipsychotic medication.

4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has spiking fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection such as pneumonia or sepsis.

5. Seizure, without status epilepticus: The patient experienced a seizure in the setting of overdose, fever, and leukocytosis, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

6. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, likely due to inhaling gastric contents, leading to respiratory failure and the need for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 19-year-old male with bipolar disorder who was admitted for unresponsiveness, thought to be due to a clozapine overdose. The patient also had fever, seizure, and required intubation in the field. He was extubated but experienced agitation, leading to the need for psychiatric consultation. The patient attempted suicide and has a history of impulsive behaviors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has shown signs of aspiration pneumonia with spiking fevers, high suspicion for aspiration pneumonia, and airspace disease on the chest X-ray. BAL gram stain showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but preliminary cultures were negative. The patient received ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and vancomycin, and the plan is to continue Unasyn for broad coverage of CAP and aspiration. Vancomycin can be discontinued as there are no positive culture data from BAL.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient is still not completely oriented x 3 and has been experiencing delirium or confusion.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has had hypoxemia, which may be related to aspiration pneumonia.
4. Hypovolemia (volume depletion - without shock): The patient has shown signs of volume depletion.
5. Seizure: The patient had a seizure, possibly related to an overdose, and there is a concern for meningitis. Acyclovir was continued pending HSV PCR from"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 19-year-old male with bipolar disorder, was admitted with unresponsiveness, thought to be due to a Clozaril overdose, along with fever and seizure. He was intubated in the field.
- The patient has been experiencing suicidal ideation and agitation, for which he is being given Haloperidol (Haldol) every 2 hours as needed. Monitoring for QTc prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is ongoing.
- The patient has aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is now off ventilatory support, and a bronchoscopic examination showed left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's fever has resolved, and cultures have been negative. He has received ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Unasyn will be continued for broad coverage of community-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia, but vancomycin can be discontinued since there is no positive culture data from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
- The patient had a seizure in the setting of overdose, fever, and leukocytosis, which was likely related to the overdose and not due to meningitis. Acyclovir has been continued pending HSV PCR from lumbar puncture.
- The patient's ECG changes have stabilized, and it is okay to discontinue bicarbonate gtt.
- The patient is hypov"
