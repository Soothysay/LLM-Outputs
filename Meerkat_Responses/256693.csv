   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   pneumonia, PE, and leukostasis.  CXR shows small right pleural effusion
   and right upper lung airway disease.  Patient afebrile with scant
   sputum, however, and new lung findings developed while on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics.  D-dimer neg so PE unlikely, though assay
   can be falsely low when patient is anticoagulated, as Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 4948**] was
   (PTT 75 at time of test).  Leukostasis also a concern given profound
   leukocytosis, though no headaches or visual changes on exam.  Heme/onc
   thinks leukostasis unlikely but will treat empirically.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - heme/onc does not believe leukapheresis indicated at this time
   - consider bronch and biopsy
   - consider LENIs
   - consider repeat D-dimer off heparin
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   #. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Concerning for
   infection vs steroid-effect vs known C. diff infection effect vs
   progression or transformation of leukemia.  Per onc, in patient's with
   CMML, white counts can rise significantly in setting of infection.
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool cx
   - antibiotics as above and po flagyl for C. diff
   - flow cytometry
   - consider ID c/s (reccomended by heme/onc)
   - follow up results of bone marrow biopsy performed at [**Hospital3 **]
   - Treating with Hydrea 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] to bring down WBC count acutely.
   #. Right sided pulmonary infiltrate:  Developed during hospitalization
   at [**Hospital1 **] so will treat empirically for HAP but concerned about
   leukostasis as above.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - sputum cx
   - heme/onc eval as above
   #. Atypical chest pain:  Symptoms fit an anginal pattern, with
   worsening left chest pain with activity, but no EKG changes or
   q-waves.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to lung process vs MSK.
   - continue to follow
   #. C. diff:  Began four days after starting vanc/levo at [**Hospital1 **] and
   treated with po vancomycin per renal reccs by their consult service.
   - will treat with po flagyl alone and not continue po vanc
   #. Rectal mass:  Biopsied at [**Hospital1 **] by surgery under anesthesia.  Not
   visually apparent on exam.
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   #. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Has not received chemotherapy for this.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to
   history of cyclophosphamide for membranous nephropathy.
   - f/u heme/onc reccs
   #. Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy.
   - renally dose meds

","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who is requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**] for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress. 

The patient's 24-hour events include receiving Metronidazole, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). He is currently on various ICU medications and other medications as well.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/48 to 138/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a small right pleural effusion and right upper lung airway disease as per the chest X-ray.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance with no acute distress. He has normal breath sounds, crackles in the respiratory/chest area, and absent peripheral pulses in both extremities. Neurologic examination shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and movement, tone, and skin assessments are not evaluated.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 104.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations
   -continue hydroxyurea
   -Bone Marrow biopsy being read by in house pathology, f/u results
   -follow up flow cytometry
   - follow tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and several other medical conditions. The note indicates that the patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress, which could be caused by bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, interstitial lung disease such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAP), or pulmonary embolism (PE). The chest CT scan suggests multifocal infection but rules out leukostasis, hemorrhage, or pulmonary edema.

The patient's white blood cell count has increased significantly from admission to the current level of 104K, indicating leukocytosis. This could be due to pulmonary infection, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), steroid effect, or transformation of leukemia. The patient is currently being treated with hydroxyurea for leukocytosis and antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia.

The patient also has a confirmed case of C. difficile infection and is being treated with oral Flagyl. Additionally, the patient has a history of chronic renal failure, CMML, leukemia, and nephrotic syndrome with membranous nephropathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypoxic respiratory distress, progression of leukocytosis, development of renal failure, and potential complications related to the patient's underlying conditions such as CMML and leukemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), requesting transfer to another hospital for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory distress, leukocytosis, rectal mass, Clostridium difficile infection, chronic renal failure, pneumonia, activity intolerance, and chronic leukemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 122/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased sodium and potassium levels. Imaging studies reveal multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening in the lungs, consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, heparin, and hydroxyurea. The patient's medical team is considering a bronchoscopy to determine the diagnosis and will also check for fungal infection markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygenation, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If left untreated, it may progress to sepsis and multiple organ"

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/49 mmHg to 140/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished and not in acute distress. 

The physical examination reveals crackles in the bibasilar region of the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm and well-perfused extremities, and oriented neurologically. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) from 40K to 104K, with a trend decreasing after starting hydroxyurea. Other lab values such as hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), glucose, and liver function tests are within normal ranges or show minimal abnormalities. Imaging studies, including a chest CT scan, indicate multifocal infection or aspiration, but no evidence of leukostasis, hemorrhage, or pulmonary edema. 

The patient's assessment and plan include several diagnoses and interventions:

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations
   -continue hydroxyurea
   -Bone Marrow biopsy being read by in house pathology, f/u results
   -follow up flow cytometry
   - follow tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
    3. Rectal mass:  Found incidentally at OSH. Biopsied at OSH,
   preliminary path read concerning for SCC. CEA results within normal
   limits.
   -appreciate surgical consult recommendations
   -biopsy now in [**Hospital1 5**] pathology
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   -MRI pelvis, MRI liver
   -Endoscopic U/S
   4. C. diff confirmed while at outside hospital. On PO flagyl day [**3-3**]
   - Continue flagyl
    5. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Had not received chemotherapy for this.  Concern for
   possible AML transformation as above. On hydroxyurea. Management as
   above
   6.  Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy per past diagnosis.
   - renally dose meds
   7. Anemia. Hct drop from 37 to 30 on admission. No stable at 30. Most
   likely dilutional and possible contribution from suppression by
   hydroxyurea. No indication of bleed. Continue to follow.
   FEN: NPO for bronchoscopy.
