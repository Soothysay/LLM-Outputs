   Assessment and Plan
   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc and Cefepime and
   discharged on a course of Augementin x 10 days. Will continue on
   Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin for CAP, Vancomycin for HAP given recent
   hospitalizations.
   .
   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx include delirium, meningitis, metastatic
   disease. On review of pt's mentation prior to his AMA discharge acute
   delirium from his underlying PNA is high on the differential, and was
   likely only partially treated. His waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] non-verbal status
   speaks for this. Other ddx to consider given the fevers is meningitis.
   Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was noted to have auditory
   hallucinations which is interesting given the ?mass in her temporal
   lobe. Would expect more focal signs though as opposed to global.
   Neurology were consulted in the ED and recommended infectious work up,
   MRI/MRA, U/A, avoid psychotrophics
   - will check MRI/MRA brain w/ and w/o contrast
   - will check U/A, LFTs
   - will avoid psychotropics, consider seroquel

   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - bactrim ppx when taking PO
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will
   start on Labetalol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, suspected to be caused by delirium or intracranial disease. The patient has a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post-transplant with complications of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He also has hypertension (HTN) and has been experiencing fever, chills, and tachycardia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's pneumonia appears to have progressed during his hospitalization. He was treated with intravenous vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime, and discharged on a course of augmentin for 10 days. He will continue on ceftriaxone, levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to recent hospitalizations.
2. Altered Mental Status: The differential diagnosis includes status epilepticus, delirium, meningitis, and intracranial disease. Given the patient's acute delirium from underlying PNA, this is high on the differential. However, the patient's presentation this morning is different, raising concern for central sources including seizure and intracranial disease. Viral meningitis/encephalitis should also be ruled out.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is presenting with acute-on-chronic altered mental status (AMS). The differential diagnosis includes seizure, delirium, viral meningitis, or intracranial disease. The presence of auditory hallucinations and a suspected mass in the temporal lobe raises concern for possible encephalitis. Further evaluation, including lumbar puncture (LP) labs and HSV PCR, is needed to rule out viral meningitis or encephalitis.

2. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be due to an underlying infection (PNA) as indicated by the continued antibiotic therapy. It is important to monitor the patient's response to the antibiotics and check urine analysis (U/A) and liver function tests (LFTs) for any signs of improvement.

3. Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis: The patient is receiving acyclovir, an antiviral medication, which suggests a suspicion of encephalitis or viral meningitis. The results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, and EBV tests are pending, and it is crucial to continue the antiviral therapy until the results are available.

4. Seizure: Although the EEG did not show any seizure activity, there is still a possibility that the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, which may be acute on chronic. The patient has been intubated for tachypnea and required pressors during an MRI. He has been diagnosed with PNA and has undergone multiple antibiotic treatments. He also has hyponatremia, ARF, HTN, and is suspected of having viral meningitis or encephalitis. The patient is non-verbal and arousable only to painful stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes such as seizure, delirium, viral meningitis, or intracranial disease. It is essential to rule out these conditions and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Delirium: The patient continues to receive antibiotics for presumed pneumonia and will have urine analysis and liver function tests done. Alk phos levels are trending down, indicating improvement.
3. Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis: The patient is awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, and EBV tests. Acyclovir treatment will be continued.
4. Seizure: Although there is no active seizure activity on EEG, it is possible that the patient is intermittently seizing. An EEG will be repeated.

   Assessment and Plan

   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx include Seizure less likely status as no
   seizure activity on EEG, delirium, viral meningitis, or intracranial
   disease. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must
   r/o viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR.
   Pt was noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given
   the ?mass in his temporal lobe. Unfortunately the his tachypnea
   yesterday lead to an early morning intubation.
   Delerium:
          - continue ABX for PNA as below
          - will check U/A (-), LFTs
 WNL, Alk phos is trending down
   today
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
          - continue Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - EEG
showed only diffuse slowing
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - f/u final read of MRI
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, could be sick euthyroid will check other levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR is pending
   .
   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated yesterday for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient currently
   alkalemic with elevated pO2 on current vent settings.
   -turn down O2, decrease rate as we believe patient is a chronic CO2
   retainer.  This will also help us optimize for extubation.  Would keep
   patient ventilated as we [**Male First Name (un) **]
t yet have a source for underlying
   tachypnea which lead to intubation in the first place.
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Would lump these problems as urine output appears to
   have slowed to 30-40 cc/hr,
   Bump in BUN relative to CRE, and hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal
   azotemia and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - bolus 1L NS
   - check urine lytes
   - nutrition consult re-tube feeds
   .
   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc and Cefepime and
   discharged on a course of Augementin x 10 days. Will continue on
   Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin for CAP, Vancomycin for HAP given recent
   hospitalizations.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will
   start on Labetalol.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a male with several medical conditions and complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), likely acute on chronic AMS.
- He has been intubated for tachypnea and is on invasive ventilation.
- The patient has a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans after a stem cell transplant for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
- He has hyponatremia and acute kidney injury (ARF), which may be due to pre-renal azotemia and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
- The patient has pneumonia (PNA) that has progressed despite treatment with vancomycin and cefepime.
- He also has hypertension (HTN) and is started on labetalol.
- The patient is receiving tube feeding, and a nutrition consult has been ordered.
- His code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and auditory hallucinations indicate delirium. Monitoring for changes in mental status and ensuring appropriate medication management is crucial.
2. Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis: The patient's AMS and potential seizure activity raise concerns for encephalitis or viral meningitis. Waiting for HSV, HHV-6, JCV,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans following a stem cell transplant for CML. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and is currently intubated. The patient's conditions include hyponatremia, drop in platelets, and a possible intracranial disease process, such as glioma, toxoplasmosis, or other causes. He has been treated with various antibiotics and antiviral medications. The patient's mental status is acute on chronic, with auditory hallucinations noted. Neurosurgery and oncology consultations have been obtained, and an MRI is planned. The patient also has hypertension and autonomic dysregulation. He has been receiving tube feedings and is on multiple medications, including labetalol for hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and auditory hallucinations indicate possible delirium. It is important to rule out viral meningitis/encephalitis and continue appropriate antibiotics and antiviral therapy.
2. Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis: Awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, and EBV tests to confirm the diagnosis. Acyclovir should be continued.
3. Seizure: Although there is no active seizure activity on EEG, the possibility of intermittent seizures should be considered, and a 24-hour EEG should be discussed with"

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes intermittent seizure vs.
   intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) vs. delirium. This
   presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must r/o viral
   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was
   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the
   ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - continue ABX for PNA as below
          - IV Vanc, levaquin
 d/c Cefepime
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
          - continue Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Will discuss 24 hour EEG with Neuro
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy today (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 39**]?)
    -1. Heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass
effect within the right frontotemporal lobe, similar to that seen
on the recent CT scan and outside neck MRI. This finding may
reflect post-radiation change, though the possibility for
superimposed infection, metastatic disease or even a
graft-versus-host disease cannot be excluded.
2. Punctate subacute hemorrhage within the posterior aspect of
the left superior temporal gyrus associated with additional areas
of hemosiderin staining throughout the subarachnoid space
bilaterally with no hydrocephalus
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, could be sick euthyroid will check other levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR is pending
   .
   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated yesterday for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient slightly
   acidemic with pCO2 of 50, would be content with these settings as he
   likely lives close to here.
             - would leave patient intubated pending decision on biopsy
   today
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Urine lytes pre-renal, responded to IVF today.  Bump
   in BUN relative to CRE, and hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal azotemia
   and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - bolus 1L NS
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc, Cefepime,
   levaquin currently.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will
   start on Labetalol.
   - labetalol 10mg q6h for now
   - ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection
   .
   ##. FEN: tube feeding consult in, replete PRN
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed full
   .
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending Mental Status improvement.

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post-transplant, complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, suspected encephalitis/viral meningitis, and respiratory failure. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, but the source of infection has not been identified. 

The patient's recent medical history includes a brain MRI showing heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass effect within the right frontotemporal lobe. This finding may reflect post-radiation change, though the possibility for superimposed infection, metastatic disease, or even graft-versus-host disease cannot be excluded. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 130/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. 

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 27 mEq/L, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 155 K/uL. Other lab abnormalities include elevated creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyponatremia and drop in platelet count. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

From the note, it is mentioned that the initial MRI head suggested Toxo (toxoplasmosis), post-radiation change, superimposed infection, metastatic disease, or graft-versus-host disease. As a result, empiric therapy for toxoplasmosis was held off. The patient also has a history of not taking lorazepam at home.

Sputum culture results showed budding yeast (possibly Cryptococcus) and gram-positive cocci in pairs. The patient has allergies to Amphotericin B, Ambisome (Amphotericin B Liposome), Campath (Alemtuzumab), and Heparin Agents.

The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin, and Acyclovir) over the course of two days.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/71 mmHg to 178/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,812 mL and an output of 1,145 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,667 mL.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on CPAP/PSV with set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 190.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 33.1%, platelet count of 155 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 63 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

The patient's assessment includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Toxoplasmosis: The presence of Toxo on the initial MRI head suggests a possible infection with Cryptococcus, which can cause serious complications in immunocompromised patients.
2. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The mention of GVHD as a possible diagnosis indicates a potential complication related to stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.
3. Metastatic disease: If the patient has metastatic cancer, it can lead to various complications such as organ dysfunction, respiratory distress, and decreased overall prognosis.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels can result in symptoms like confusion, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias if not corrected promptly.
5. Drop in platelet count: Thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.
6. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state makes him susceptible to infections, and the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs may indicate a bacterial infection.
7. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory parameters suggest the need for close monitoring, and the risk of ventilator-associated complications should be considered.

It is important to note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details or tests may be required to assess the patient's condition more accurately."

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes intermittent seizure vs.
   intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) vs. delirium. This
   presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must r/o viral
   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was
   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the
   ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - continue ABX for PNA as below
          - IV Vanc, Cefepime, levaquin
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
          - continue Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Will discuss 24 hour EEG with Neuro
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy today (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 39**]?)
    -1. Heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass
effect within the right frontotemporal lobe, similar to that seen
on the recent CT scan and outside neck MRI. This finding may
reflect post-radiation change, though the possibility for
superimposed infection, metastatic disease or even a
graft-versus-host disease cannot be excluded.
2. Punctate subacute hemorrhage within the posterior aspect of
the left superior temporal gyrus associated with additional areas
of hemosiderin staining throughout the subarachnoid space
bilaterally with no hydrocephalus
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, could be sick euthyroid will check other levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR is pending
   .
   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated yesterday for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient slightly
   acidemic with pCO2 of 50, would be content with these settings as he
   likely lives close to here.
             - would leave patient intubated pending decision on biopsy
   today
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Urine lytes pre-renal, responded to IVF today.  Bump
   in BUN relative to CRE, and hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal azotemia
   and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - bolus 1L NS
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc, Cefepime,
   levaquin currently.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will
   start on Labetalol.
   - labetalol 10mg q6h for now
   - ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection
   .
   ##. FEN: tube feeding consult in, replete PRN
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed full
   .
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending Mental Status improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The differential diagnosis for the altered mental status includes intermittent seizure, intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other), delirium, encephalitis/viral meningitis, and toxic/metabolic causes. The patient's recent history includes a stem cell transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which was complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient was on a prednisone taper as an outpatient.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 130/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 403.

The patient has several laboratory abnormalities, including hyponatremia with a serum sodium level of 26 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 155 K/uL. The patient's other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass effect within the right frontotemporal lobe, which may reflect post-radiation change or superimposed infection, metastatic disease, or graft-versus-host disease. There is also punctate subacute hemorrhage within the posterior aspect of the left superior temporal gyrus associated with additional areas of hemosiderin staining throughout the subarachnoid space bilaterally without hydrocephalus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to delirium, which is common in critically ill patients. The patient's symptoms may be acute on chronic and require further evaluation to rule out other causes.

2. Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis: Given the patient's immunocompromised status post-transplant, there is a possibility of viral encephalitis or meningitis. The patient is already receiving acyclovir for presumed herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and additional tests are pending to rule out other viral agents.

3. Seizure: Although the EEG does not show active seizure activity, the possibility of intermittent seizures"

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes intermittent seizure vs.
   intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) vs. delirium. This
   presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must r/o viral
   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was
   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the
   ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - continue ABX for PNA as below
          - IV Vanc(AM trough looked good, restarting at 1gm q24hr),
   levaquin
 d/c Cefepime
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 nothing back yet
          - all culture data is negative so far
          - continue Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Phosfenytoin loaded in anticipation of Neurosurgical
   procedure.
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy Tuesday (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
            - Plan is as follows -> remain intubated, ASL MRI tomorrow,
   extubate if clinically feasible -> Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to present at tumor board
   on Monday, possible Bx on Tuesday.
    .
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for tachypnea,
   likely impending respiratory faillure.  .  Would attempt to get patient
   back to hypercapneic baseline, as wont succeed in extubation without.
             - would leave patient intubated pending MRI
             - would not prolong nasal intubation given underlying sinus
   disease
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Urine lytes pre-renal, responded to IVF today.  Bump
   in BUN relative to CRE, and hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal azotemia
   and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Continue prn NS boluses
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc, Cefepime,
   levaquin currently.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will
   start on Labetalol.
   - labetalol 10mg q6h for now
   - ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection
   .
   ##. FEN: tube feeding consult in, replete PRN -?PEG at time procedure
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed full
   .
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending Mental Status improvement.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The differential diagnosis includes intermittent seizure versus intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) versus delirium. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for presumed pneumonia and is currently on antiviral therapy for suspected encephalitis or viral meningitis. He is also being given phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, blood pressure of 141/77 mmHg, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 328 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 408, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 270.

The patient's laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 139 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, total bilirubin level of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and sodium level of 130 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including altered mental status, possible encephalitis or viral meningitis, pneumonia, chronic graft-versus-host disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. He is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, anticonvulsants, and steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of the patient's altered mental status, development of new neurological deficits, progression of pneumonia or other infections, exacerbation of hypertension, and further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these conditions are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a complex medical history including altered mental status (AMS), chronic GVHD post-transplant, bronchiolitis obliterans, hypertension (HTN), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post-transplant. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU due to tachypnea and impending respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 141/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 328 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count (Plt) of 139 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level (Na+) of 108 mEq/L, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient is also receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and anti-seizure medications.

The assessment and plan section of the note highlights several potential diagnoses, including altered mental status (AMS), delirium, encephalitis/viral meningitis, seizure, intracranial disease process, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, increased work of breathing/respiratory failure, hyponatremia/acute renal failure (ARF), pneumonia (PNA), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post-transplant, hypertension (HTN), and chronic GVHD/bronchiolitis obliterans.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of seizures, and there is a possibility of recurrent seizure activity, which could lead to complications like status epilepticus.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, and there is a concern for other infections such as viral meningitis or encephalitis. The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of opportunistic infections.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has hyponatremia and evidence of pre-renal azotemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes intermittent seizure vs.
   intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) vs. delirium. This
   presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must r/o viral
   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was
   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the
   ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - continue ABX for PNA as below
          - IV Vanc(AM trough looked good, restarting at 1gm q24hr),
   levaquin
 d/c Cefepime
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
          - continue Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Phosfenytoin loaded in anticipation of Neurosurgical
   procedure.
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy Tuesday (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
            - Plan is as follows -> remain intubated, ASL MRI tomorrow,
   extubate -> Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to present at tumor board on Monday, possible Bx
   on Tuesday.
    .
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR is pending
   .
   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for tachypnea,
   likely impending respiratory faillure.  Gas looked great, but would
   lower FiO2 given elevated PO2
             - would leave patient intubated pending MRI
             - would not prolong nasal intubation given underlying sinus
   disease
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Urine lytes pre-renal, responded to IVF today.  Bump
   in BUN relative to CRE, and hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal azotemia
   and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Continue prn NS boluses
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc, Cefepime,
   levaquin currently.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will
   start on Labetalol.
   - labetalol 10mg q6h for now
   - ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection
   .
   ##. FEN: tube feeding consult in, replete PRN
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed full
   .
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending Mental Status improvement.

   Altered mental status possibly due to combination of CNS lesions and

   cells. Due for additional MRI to further characterize the CNS lesions.
   Patient probably has a post-hypercapnic metabolic alkalosis now.
   Baseline bicarb last admission was 42; he has likely been
   overventilated from baseline status and is likely not to be able to
   sustain spontaneous ventilation at this level of PaCO2. Following MRI
   today, will stop propofol and assess RSBI. If he fails, I would then
   resedate and ventilate him such that PaCO2 is in low 50's to achieve pH
   less than 7.35; as bicarb comes up, further reduce ventilation and
   achieve higher PaCO2.
   Nutrition remains a problem because of difficulty getting access for
   enteral or IV nutrition. Will discuss possibility of an OG tube with
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
   Hyponatremia stable. If it drops assess meds for free water.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, and they are currently on mechanical ventilation with 40% FiO2 and PSV mode. The patient has a history of GVHD, BOOP, pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure. They are also being evaluated for CNS lesions and have started anti-epileptics. The patient has allergies to Amphotericin B, Ambisome, Campath, and Heparin agents. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/72 to 141/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and oxygen delivery device are also noted.

   1. Heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass effect
   within
   the right frontotemporal lobe -partly characterized on the recent CT
   scan and
   outside neck MRI from [**Month (only) 2605**]. While the above findings could reflect
   post-radiation change as previously suggested, consideration should be
   given
   to the possibility for radiation induced neoplasm, related to
   CML/sarcoma of
   the face/denovo or even graft-versus-host disease. Further
   characterization
   is suggested, which could take the form of a Thallium/PET scan and/or
   biopsy.

   about 6
   months earlier.

   superior temporal gyrus associated with additional areas of hemosiderin
   staining throughout the subarachnoid space bilaterally with no
   hydrocephalus.
   A hemorrhagic focus, cavernoma are likely; metastatic or infectious
   lesion
   remains possible despite the lack of solid enhancement, however less
   likely.
   Attention on follow up can be considered.

From the note, we can gather the following information:
1. The patient experienced a hypotensive episode after receiving IV labetalol, propofol, and Bactrim. The blood pressure dropped to the 30s and recovered quickly with IV fluids and pressors.
2. The patient was given a trial of PSV (not specified) but became agitated and hypoxic, so they were placed back on assisted ventilation (AC).
3. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 109/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.
4. The patient is sedated and not responsive to commands.
5. The patient has a history of allergies to amphotericin B, Ambisome, Campath, and unknown heparin agents.
6. The patient has received various antibiotics including cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, Bactrim, and acyclovir.
7. The patient has multiple infusions of medications such as fosphenytoin and labetalol.

","The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status. The patient experienced a hypotensive episode after receiving IV labetalol, propofol, and IV Bactrim around the same time, with a subsequent drop in systolic blood pressure to the 30s. The patient was quickly resuscitated with intravenous fluids (IVF) and pressors for approximately 2 minutes. The patient was then placed back on assisted control (AC) ventilation.

The patient has a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans following a stem cell transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia (PNA) with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.

The patient has been sedated and intubated due to tachypnea and impending respiratory failure. There are plans to attempt extubation once the patient's mental status improves, but this will depend on the results of an upcoming MRI.

The patient has hyponatremia and acute kidney injury (ARF), which is suspected to be pre-renal azotemia and hypovolemic hyponatremia. The patient is being treated with intravenous fluids and medications such as prednisone for chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans.

The patient's respiratory culture showed moderate growth of yeast and gram-negative rods, while the sputum Gram"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has multiple medical conditions, including chronic GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, CML post-transplant, PNA, and hypertension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. He is also on various medications, including IV antibiotics (Vanc, Cefepime, Levofloxacin), antivirals (Acyclovir), and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient presents with acute-on-chronic altered mental status, which may be due to delirium. It is important to rule out viral meningitis/encephalitis. Further evaluation with LP labs and HSV PCR is planned.
2. Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis: The patient is being treated with Acyclovir, as there is a suspicion of encephalitis or viral meningitis. Awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV PCR.
3. Seizure: Although the patient does not have active seizure activity on EEG, it is possible that he is intermittently seizing. Phosphenytoin has been loaded in anticipation of a neurosurgical procedure.
4. Intracranial Disease Process: There is a concern for an intracranial"

   Imaging: Study limited due to lack of IV contrast and technical issues.
   No large obvious area of increased signal on the ASL to sugest
   increased
   perfusion- however, limited due to low resoluton.
   MRS: Low NAA in the right frontal and temporal lobe areas sampled-
   cannot
   exlcude tumor.
   Consider correlation wtih PET and Biopsy.
   1. Heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass effect
   within
   the right frontotemporal lobe -partly characterized on the recent CT
   scan and
   outside neck MRI from [**Month (only) 2605**]. While the above findings could reflect
   post-radiation change as previously suggested, consideration should be
   given
   to the possibility for radiation induced neoplasm, related to
   CML/sarcoma of
   the face/denovo or even graft-versus-host disease. Further
   characterization
   is suggested, which could take the form of a Thallium/PET scan and/or
   biopsy.
   Infection is less likely given it's identification on MR Neck done
   about 6
   months earlier.
   2. Punctate subacute hemorrhage within the posterior aspect of the left
   superior temporal gyrus associated with additional areas of hemosiderin
   staining throughout the subarachnoid space bilaterally with no
   hydrocephalus.
   A hemorrhagic focus, cavernoma are likely; metastatic or infectious
   lesion
   remains possible despite the lack of solid enhancement, however less
   likely.
   Attention on follow up can be considered.

   bilaterally
   with air-fluid levels as well as partial visualization of the
   post-surgical

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans following a CML transplant. He is currently intubated due to tachypnea and impending respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/63 mmHg to 142/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, elevated BUN, and creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal a heterogeneous signal and enhancement in the right frontotemporal lobe, which may be indicative of post-radiation change, radiation-induced neoplasm, or graft-versus-host disease. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, antivirals, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium, which is often associated with infection or other underlying causes.
2. Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis: The patient's symptoms may suggest encephalitis or viral meningitis. Further testing is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

   Imaging: Study limited due to lack of IV contrast and technical issues.
   No large obvious area of increased signal on the ASL to sugest
   increased
   perfusion- however, limited due to low resoluton.
   MRS: Low NAA in the right frontal and temporal lobe areas sampled-
   cannot
   exlcude tumor.
   Consider correlation wtih PET and Biopsy.
   1. Heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass effect
   within
   the right frontotemporal lobe -partly characterized on the recent CT
   scan and
   outside neck MRI from [**Month (only) 2605**]. While the above findings could reflect
   post-radiation change as previously suggested, consideration should be
   given
   to the possibility for radiation induced neoplasm, related to
   CML/sarcoma of
   the face/denovo or even graft-versus-host disease. Further
   characterization
   is suggested, which could take the form of a Thallium/PET scan and/or
   biopsy.
   Infection is less likely given it's identification on MR Neck done
   about 6
   months earlier.
   2. Punctate subacute hemorrhage within the posterior aspect of the left
   superior temporal gyrus associated with additional areas of hemosiderin
   staining throughout the subarachnoid space bilaterally with no
   hydrocephalus.
   A hemorrhagic focus, cavernoma are likely; metastatic or infectious
   lesion
   remains possible despite the lack of solid enhancement, however less
   likely.
   Attention on follow up can be considered.
   3. Extensive maxillary sinus and bil. mastoid air cell disease
   bilaterally

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes intermittent seizure vs.
   intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) vs. delirium. This
   presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must r/o viral
   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was
   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the
   ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - continue ABX for PNA as below
          - IV Vanc(AM trough looked good, restarting at 1gm q24hr),
   levaquin
 d/c Cefepime
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 nothing back yet
          - all culture data is negative so far
          - continue Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Phosfenytoin loaded in anticipation of Neurosurgical
   procedure.
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy Tuesday (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
            - Plan is as follows -> remain intubated, ASL MRI tomorrow,
   extubate if clinically feasible -> Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to present at tumor board
   on Monday, possible Bx on Tuesday.
    .
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for tachypnea,
   likely impending respiratory faillure.  .  Would attempt to get patient
   back to hypercapneic baseline, as wont succeed in extubation without.
             - would leave patient intubated pending MRI
             - would not prolong nasal intubation given underlying sinus
   disease
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Urine lytes pre-renal, responded to IVF today.  Bump
   in BUN relative to CRE, and hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal azotemia
   and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Continue prn NS boluses
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc, Cefepime,
   levaquin currently.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will
   start on Labetalol.
   - labetalol 10mg q6h for now
   - ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection
   .
   ##. FEN: tube feeding consult in, replete PRN -?PEG at time procedure
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed full

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans after a stem cell transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The patient is currently intubated in the ICU for tachypnea and likely impending respiratory failure. He has been treated with various antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, which appears to have progressed during his hospitalization.

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, likely due to pre-renal azotemia and hypovolemic hyponatremia. His urine electrolytes indicate pre-renal causes. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he has been started on labetalol to manage hypertension. His heart rate is also elevated, possibly due to adrenergic tone from agitation.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a heterogeneous signal and enhancement in the right frontotemporal lobe, which could be post-radiation change or a radiation-induced neoplasm. There is also a punctate subacute hemorrhage in the left superior temporal gyrus with additional areas of hemosiderin staining throughout the subarachnoid space. The maxillary sinus and bilateral mastoid air cell disease are present, as well as partial visualization of post-surgical changes in the right face.

The patient's respiratory cultures show moderate growth of yeast and gram-negative rods, while"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and a CNS mass. The patient's MRI results are pending, and they have been unable to place an OG tube due to the patient biting. Increased sedation has led to episodes of hypotension. The patient was placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) this morning. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 95/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on propofol infusion at a rate of 45 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased agitation. The flow sheet data shows fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient is on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory system compliance of 25 cmH2O/mL, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.18, PaCO2 of 71 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, attentive behavior, and purposeful movement. However, the patient has poor dentition, endotracheal tube in place, no NG or OG tube, and loud"

   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes intermittent seizure vs.
   intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) vs. delirium. This
   presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must r/o viral
   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was
   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the
   ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - continue ABX for PNA as below
          - IV Vanc(AM trough looked good, restarting at 1gm q24hr)[**Last Name (un) 3554**]
   trough tomorrow AM, levaquin
 d/c Cefepime
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 nothing back yet
          - all culture data is negative so far
          - continue Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Phosfenytoin loaded in anticipation of Neurosurgical
   procedure.  Will ask pharmacy about readjusting dosing given level of 5
   today.
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy Tuesday (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
   tumor board today, will discuss lack on contrast on MRI with team
   today.
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for tachypnea,
   likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient closer to hypercapneic
   baseline with current settings
             - would leave patient intubated pending bx tomorrow at this
   point, as would not have been ready to extubate this weekend.
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Urine lytes pre-renal, appearrs did not get IVF
   yesterday and all numbers bumped.  Bump in BUN relative to CRE, and
   hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal azotemia and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Continue prn NS boluses
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: On review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc, levaquin
   currently.  Will call lab for results after rounds.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.
   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.  d/c
d labetalol in setting
   of hypotension.
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, ?PEG-tube in OR
   tomorrow

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans following a CML transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected intracranial disease, possible encephalitis or viral meningitis, and pneumonia. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, antivirals, and seizure medication. He remains intubated due to respiratory failure and is awaiting a neurosurgical procedure for biopsy. The patient has multiple medical complications including hyponatremia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and difficulty with enteral feeding. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has been treated for seizures, but there is still a possibility of recurrent seizures due to underlying intracranial disease.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on ventilatory support, which indicates respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient may still develop a new infection or have an existing infection that is not yet controlled.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient has suspected intracranial disease, and there is a risk of neurological deterioration if the underlying cause is not identified and treated promptly.
5. Kidney injury: The patient shows signs of acute kidney injury, which can worsen if not properly managed.

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes intermittent seizure vs.
   intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) vs. delirium. This
   presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must r/o viral
   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was
   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the
   ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - continue ABX for PNA as below
          - IV Vanc(AM trough looked good, restarting at 1gm q24hr)[**Last Name (un) 3554**]
   trough tomorrow AM, levaquin
 d/c Cefepime
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 nothing back yet
          - all culture data is negative so far
          - continue Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Phosfenytoin loaded in anticipation of Neurosurgical
   procedure.  Will ask pharmacy about readjusting dosing given level of 5
   today.
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy Tuesday (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
   tumor board today, will discuss lack on contrast on MRI with team
   today.
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for tachypnea,
   likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient closer to hypercapneic
   baseline with current settings
             - would leave patient intubated pending bx tomorrow at this
   point, as would not have been ready to extubate this weekend.
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Urine lytes pre-renal, appearrs did not get IVF
   yesterday and all numbers bumped.  Bump in BUN relative to CRE, and
   hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal azotemia and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Continue prn NS boluses
   - check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: On review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc, levaquin
   currently.  Will call lab for results after rounds.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.
   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.  d/c
d labetalol in setting
   of hypotension.
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, ?PEG-tube in OR
   tomorrow
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: full

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing intermittent seizure-like activity, intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other), or delirium. It is important to rule out viral meningitis/encephalitis and continue antiviral treatment.

2. Delirium: Continue antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia (PNA) and restart Vancomycin at a dosage of 1g every 24 hours. Monitor for any changes in mental status.

3. Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis: Awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, and EBV tests. Continue Acyclovir treatment and monitor for any signs of improvement or worsening of symptoms.

4. Seizure: No active seizure activity on EEG, but there is a possibility of intermittent seizures. Load Phosphenytoin and adjust dosing based on the current level of 5.

5. Intracranial Disease Process: Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy on Tuesday. Discuss lack of contrast on MRI with the team today.

6. Toxic Metabolic: TSH is 7, likely sick euthyroid syndrome. Check other thyroid levels and rule out toxic or metabolic causes.

7. Increased Work of Breathing/Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to tachypnea and"

   Assessment and Plan
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient closer to
   hypercapneic baseline with current settings.   Will attempt to wean off
   the vent at this point, barriers to extubation include LOS fluid + 15
   liters.
   -Lasix drip
 with goal
([**3-13**]) liters per day
   - Presure support/wean as tolerated
   - Concentrate and d/c unnecessary antibiotics
   .
   ##. Unclear progress of Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes
   intermittent seizure vs. intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other)
   vs. delirium. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We
   must r/o viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV
   PCR. Pt was noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting
   given the ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - abx stopped as sputum revealed only commensals
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 All negative
          - Serum cryptococcus is negative, toxo IgG, IgM - negative
          - all culture data is negative
          - ? Stop Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Phosfenytoin loaded in anticipation of Neurosurgical
   procedure.  Will ask pharmacy about readjusting dosing given level of 5
   today.   Would continue this as intermittent seizure is still likely
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - No biopsy
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total body
   fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium and
   change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of
   third spaced fluids.
   - hold boluses
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: along with prior hospital course has received an extended
   course of abx.  Would stop given negative sputum.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.
   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.  d/c
d labetalol in setting
   of hypotension.
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to
   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans following a stem cell transplant for CML. The patient's current medications include propofol, pantoprazole, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is intubated due to impending respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving an extended course of antibiotics, but sputum cultures have only revealed commensals. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to tachypnea and impending respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to fluid overload.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which could be due to intermittent seizures, intracranial disease, delirium, or encephalitis/viral meningitis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Hyponatremia/Acute Renal Failure: The patient has hyponatremia and acute renal failure, which may be related to fluid overload and third spaced fluids. Monitoring electrolyte levels and kidney function is important.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glycemic control needs to be monitored closely, as ICU patients are at risk for hyperglycemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post-transplant, complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient's mental status has been altered, with intermittent auditory hallucinations, and there is suspicion of intermittent seizures. His condition is likely due to multiple factors including possible intracranial disease, toxic/metabolic causes, and hyponatremia/acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has received an extended course of antibiotics and is on various prophylactic medications. There are concerns about autonomic dysregulation and the need for an enteral feeding tube. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending improvement in mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if the current ventilator settings are inadequate or if there is a complication such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Seizures: The suspicion of intermittent seizures should be further investigated and managed appropriately to prevent seizure progression and potential complications like status epilepticus.
3. Intracranial Disease: The patient's altered mental status and potential intracranial disease could lead to further neurological deterioration, including increased intracranial pressure, herniation, or brain edema.

   Assessment and Plan
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient closer to
   hypercapneic baseline with current settings.   Will attempt to wean off
   the vent at this point, barriers to extubation include LOS fluid + 15
   liters.
   -Lasix drip
 with goal
([**3-13**]) liters per day
   - Presure support/wean as tolerated
   .
   ##. Unclear progress of Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes
   intermittent seizure vs. intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other)
   vs. delirium. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We
   must r/o viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV
   PCR. Pt was noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting
   given the ?mass in his temporal lobe.
   Delerium:
          - abx stopped as sputum revealed only commensals
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 All negative
          - Serum cryptococcus is negative, toxo IgG, IgM - negative
          - all culture data is negative
          - ? Stop Acyclovir
   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,
   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.
            - Phosfenytoin loaded in anticipation of Neurosurgical
   procedure.  Will ask pharmacy about readjusting dosing given level of 5
   today.   Would continue this as intermittent seizure is still likely
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - No biopsy
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total body
   fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium and
   change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of
   third spaced fluids.
   - hold boluses
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   ##. PNA: along with prior hospital course has received an extended
   course of abx.  Would stop given negative sputum.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.
   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.  d/c
d labetalol in setting
   of hypotension.
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to
   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes chronic GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and CML post-transplant. 

The patient has been receiving an extended course of antibiotics due to pneumonia, but with negative sputum results, the antibiotics have been stopped. The patient is currently intubated for tachypnea and likely impending respiratory failure. The barriers to extubation include fluid overload, as indicated by the 15 liters of LOS fluid.

The patient's mental status is still altered, and the differential diagnosis includes intermittent seizure, intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other), delirium, encephalitis/viral meningitis, and toxic/metabolic causes. The HSV PCR, HHV-6, JCV, EBV results are all negative, as well as serum cryptococcus and toxo IgG, IgM. All culture data is negative.

The patient has hyponatremia and acute renal failure, which is likely due to fluid overload. There has been no significant drop in sodium levels, and the BUN/CRE levels have not changed, suggesting intravascular redistribution of third spaced fluids.

Other issues include hypertension, possibly due to adrenergic tone from agitation or autonomic dysregulation versus infection. The patient's blood pressure was in the 160s with a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated due to impending respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans after a stem cell transplant for CML. He was on a Prednisone taper as an outpatient, and this will be continued on an outpatient basis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-145 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. His current weight is 61.6 kg.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Bactrim, and Vancomycin, which were stopped due to negative sputum culture results. He is currently on Lasix gtt for fluid management, with a goal of 2 liters negative per hour. Other medications include Pantoprazole, Fentanyl, and Phenytoin.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 231 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 126 mEq/L, elevated potassium at 5.7 mEq/L, and elevated creatinine at 1.4 mg/dL. Other labs, including PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/TBili, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Increased WOB/Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for tachypnea and likely impending respiratory failure. We will attempt to wean off the vent at this point, but barriers to extubation include fluid overload. Lasix drip with a goal of 2 liters negative per day will be continued, along with pressure support and weaning as tolerated.

2. Unclear progress of Altered Mental Status: The differential diagnosis includes intermittent seizure, intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other), or delirium. We need to rule out viral meningitis/encephalitis, and an EEG is planned to monitor for seizures. The patient will receive bolus sedation and phenytoin after the EEG.

3. Hyponatremia/ARF: The patient will tolerate hypotremia and ARF due to fluid overload. Other labs will be checked, and Bactrim will be discontinued.

4. PNA: The patient has received an extended course of antibiotics. If today's sputum is negative, we will stop the antibiotics.

5. CML s/p transplant: The patient has chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He will continue on outpatient Prednisone.

6. HTN: The patient has hypertension with a blood pressure in the 160s and heart rate in the 120s-130s. This may be due to adrenergic tone from agitation or infection. Labetalol will be restarted.

   Assessment and Plan
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient closer to
   hypercapneic baseline with current settings.   Will attempt to wean off
   the vent at this point, barriers to extubation include LOS fluid + 15
   liters.  Mr [**Known lastname 11322**]
s wishes are clearly that he does not want any of
   this, however his competence is almost definitely not there.  We are
   having trouble consolidated his/family wishes with medical
   appropriateness, and hope to clarify those goals today.
   -Lasix drip
 with goal
 as much as tolerated liters per day
   - Presure support/wean as tolerated
   - Extubate tomorrow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to discuss plan for patient if he does
   not fly, anticipate do not re-intubate as family and patient are
   unlikely to want extubation or PEG.
   .
   ##. Unclear progress of Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes
   intermittent seizure vs. intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other)
   vs. delirium. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We
   have r/o
d viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Pt was noted to have
   auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the ?mass in his
   temporal lobe.
   Seizure:  During our brief windows into his mental status, off sedation
   his mental status is HIGHLY variable, I have a STRONG clinical
   suspicion that he is intermittently seizing and would benefit form 24
   hour EEG monitoring.  Neuro help is greatly appreciated, they are
   trying to arrange either 20 minute or 24 hour.
            - Bolus sedation
            - re-load phosphenytoin after EEG
 1G Fosphenytoin once,
   check a peak after 2 hours, maintainence levels 150mg Q8 check a level
   in [**6-13**] days
   Delerium:
          - treatment dose abx should be d/c
d, no microorganisms on
   sputum
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 All negative
          - Serum cryptococcus is negative, toxo IgG, IgM - negative
          - all culture data is negative
          - Change Acyclovir to ppx dosing
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - No biopsy
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total body
   fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium and
   change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of
   third spaced fluids.  Would also question role of bactrim.
   - hold boluses
   - Check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   - D/C bactrim, ppx otherwise
   .
   ##. PNA: along with prior hospital course has received an extended
   course of abx.  Would stop if todays sputum is negative.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.
   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.
   - restart labetalol
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to
   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: full
   .
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending Mental Status improvement.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) status post transplant, hypertension (HTN), and a recent presentation of altered mental status (AMS). The patient was intubated due to tachypnea and impending respiratory failure. 

The assessment and plan section of the note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Increased Work of Breathing/Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored as he is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The goal is to wean off the vent, but barriers such as fluid overload are preventing extubation.
2. Unclear Progress of Altered Mental Status: The differential diagnosis includes intermittent seizure, intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other), and delirium. Auditory hallucinations and variable mental status raise suspicion for intermittent seizures, and an EEG is planned for further evaluation.
3. Hyponatremia/Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has hyponatremia and ARF, which may be related to fluid overload. It is important to monitor sodium levels and renal function closely.
4. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has received an extended course of antibiotics, and stopping them might be considered if today's sputum culture is negative.
5. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia"

   vs. delirium. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We
   have r/o
d viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Pt was noted to have
   auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the ?mass in his
   temporal lobe.
   Seizure:  During our brief windows into his mental status, off sedation
   his mental status is HIGHLY variable, I have a STRONG clinical
   suspicion that he is intermittently seizing and would benefit form 24
   hour EEG monitoring.  Neuro help is greatly appreciated, they are
   trying to arrange either 20 minute or 24 hour.
            - Bolus sedation
            - re-load phosphenytoin after EEG
 1G Fosphenytoin once,
   check a peak after 2 hours, maintainence levels 150mg Q8 check a level
   in [**6-13**] days
   Delerium:
          - treatment dose abx should be d/c
d, no microorganisms on
   sputum
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 All negative
          - Serum cryptococcus is negative, toxo IgG, IgM - negative
          - all culture data is negative
          - Change Acyclovir to ppx dosing
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - No biopsy
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total body
   fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium and
   change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of
   third spaced fluids.  Would also question role of bactrim.
   - hold boluses
   - Check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   - D/C bactrim, ppx otherwise
   .
   ##. PNA: along with prior hospital course has received an extended
   course of abx.  Would stop if todays sputum is negative.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.
   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.
   - restart labetalol

   Assessment and Plan
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient closer to
   hypercapneic baseline with current settings.   Will attempt to wean off
   the vent at this point, barriers to extubation include LOS fluid + 15
   liters.  Mr [**Known lastname 11322**]
s wishes are clearly that he does not want any of
   this, however his competence is almost definitely not there.  We are
   having trouble consolidated his/family wishes with medical
   appropriateness, and hope to clarify those goals today.
   -Lasix drip
 with goal
 as much as tolerated liters per day
   - Presure support/wean as tolerated
   - Extubate today
 with interventions if not doing well to be
   designated later.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post-transplant, complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient was admitted with acute respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has hyponatremia, acute kidney injury, altered mental status, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial admission was due to severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ongoing respiratory failure if extubation fails or if the underlying lung condition worsens.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 103 mEq/L. This may be contributing to altered mental status and should be carefully managed during any fluid or medication administration.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has AKI with elevated BUN and creatinine levels. This can further complicate the management of electrolyte imbalances and fluid balance.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient presents with intermittent auditory hallucinations and variable mental status, raising concerns for seizures or intracranial disease. EEG monitoring is recommended to assess for seizure activity.
5. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which may be related to stress or autonomic dysregulation. Blood pressure management is essential"

   Assessment and Plan
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient closer to
   hypercapneic baseline with current settings.   Will attempt to wean off
   the vent at this point, barriers to extubation include LOS fluid + 15
   liters.  Mr [**Known lastname 11322**]
s wishes are clearly that he does not want any of
   this, however his competence is almost definitely not there.  We are
   having trouble consolidated his/family wishes with medical
   appropriateness, and hope to clarify those goals today.
   -Lasix drip
 with goal
 as much as tolerated liters per day
   - Presure support/wean as tolerated
   - Extubate tomorrow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to discuss plan for patient if he does
   not fly, anticipate do not re-intubate as family and patient are
   unlikely to want extubation or PEG.
   .
   ##. Unclear progress of Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes
   intermittent seizure vs. intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other)
   vs. delirium. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We
   have r/o
d viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Pt was noted to have
   auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the ?mass in his
   temporal lobe.
   Seizure:  During our brief windows into his mental status, off sedation
   his mental status is HIGHLY variable, I have a STRONG clinical
   suspicion that he is intermittently seizing and would benefit form 24
   hour EEG monitoring.  Neuro help is greatly appreciated, they are
   trying to arrange either 20 minute or 24 hour.
            - Bolus sedation
            - re-load phosphenytoin after EEG
 1G Fosphenytoin once,
   check a peak after 2 hours, maintainence levels 150mg Q8 check a level
   in [**6-13**] days
   Delerium:
          - treatment dose abx should be d/c
d, no microorganisms on
   sputum
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 All negative
          - Serum cryptococcus is negative, toxo IgG, IgM - negative
          - all culture data is negative
          - Change Acyclovir to ppx dosing
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - No biopsy
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total body
   fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium and
   change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of
   third spaced fluids.  Would also question role of bactrim.
   - hold boluses
   - Check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   - D/C bactrim, ppx otherwise
   .
   ##. PNA: along with prior hospital course has received an extended
   course of abx.  Would stop if todays sputum is negative.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.
   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.
   - restart labetalol
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to
   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: full

   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending Mental Status improvement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post transplant, chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, hypertension, and recent gastrointestinal (GI) issues. The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/76 mmHg to 153/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation with FiO2 of 40%. The patient's neurological status is described as highly variable and there are concerns about intermittent seizures.

The patient has been receiving aggressive diuresis with electrolyte repletion, and there is a concern for fluid overload as a barrier to extubation. The patient's sodium levels are hyponatremic, and there are concerns about acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure. The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are elevated.

The patient's blood cultures, sputum cultures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis have all come back negative, ruling out bacterial meningitis and encephalitis. However, further evaluation is needed to determine"

   Assessment and Plan
   Metabolic Alkalosis: likely [**3-11**] diuresis, may indicate we are getting
   close to even.
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient looks very
   comfortable, no-longer tachypneic,  sat
ing extremely well.
   -Would diurese back to even for LOS
   .
   ##. ? Seizures: Unclear if patient was ever seizing, neurology raised
   the point that his recent bleed is in a

   ##   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total
   body fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium
   and change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of
   third spaced fluids.  Would also question role of bactrim.
   - hold boluses

   Assessment and Plan
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for
   tachypnea, likely impending respiratory faillure.  Patient closer to
   hypercapneic baseline with current settings.   Will attempt to wean off
   the vent at this point, barriers to extubation include LOS fluid + 15
   liters.  Mr [**Known lastname 11322**]
s wishes are clearly that he does not want any of
   this, however his competence is almost definitely not there.  We are
   having trouble consolidated his/family wishes with medical
   appropriateness, and hope to clarify those goals today.
   -Lasix drip
 with goal
 as much as tolerated liters per day
   - Presure support/wean as tolerated
   - Extubate today
 with interventions if not doing well to be
   designated later.
   .
   ##. Unclear progress of Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes
   intermittent seizure vs. intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other)
   vs. delirium. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We
   have r/o
d viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Pt was noted to have
   auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the ?mass in his
   temporal lobe.
   Seizure:  During our brief windows into his mental status, off sedation
   his mental status is HIGHLY variable, I have a STRONG clinical
   suspicion that he is intermittently seizing and would benefit form 24
   hour EEG monitoring.  Neuro help is greatly appreciated, they are
   trying to arrange either 20 minute or 24 hour.
            - Bolus sedation
            - re-load phosphenytoin after EEG
 1G Fosphenytoin once,
   check a peak after 2 hours, maintainence levels 150mg Q8 check a level
   in [**6-13**] days
   Delerium:
          - treatment dose abx should be d/c
d, no microorganisms on
   sputum
   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:
          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
 All negative
          - Serum cryptococcus is negative, toxo IgG, IgM - negative
          - all culture data is negative
          - Change Acyclovir to ppx dosing
   Intracranial Disease Process:
            - No biopsy
   Toxic Metabolic:
            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other
   levels
            - B12 WNL
            - RPR non-reactive
   .
   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total body
   fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium and
   change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of
   third spaced fluids.  Would also question role of bactrim.
   - hold boluses
   - Check urine lytes
   - Check PM lytes
   - D/C bactrim, ppx otherwise
   .
   ##. PNA: along with prior hospital course has received an extended
   course of abx.  Would stop if todays sputum is negative.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.
   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.
   - restart labetalol
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to
   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: full
   .
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending Mental Status improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was extubated and did well. They have multiple known allergies, including Amphotericin B, Ambisome (Intraven.), and Campath (Intraven.). The patient received various antibiotics over the past day, including Acyclovir, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), Cefipime, and Vancomycin. They were given infusions of Fentanyl and Morphine Sulfate. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission. Fluid balance indicates an input of 1,543 mL and output of 5,530 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -3,987 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode, nasal cannula oxygen delivery, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH at 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) at 55 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 118 mmol/L, base excess (BE) at -37 mmol/L, sodium (Na+) at 137 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 4.0 mEq/L, and chloride (Cl-) at 102 mEq/L. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessment were not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 262 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.5 mg/dL, increased total bilirubin (T. Bili) of 27.4 %, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 87 mg/dL, and low calcium (Ca++) of 8.2 mg/dL. The patient's chest X-ray from February 18th showed no acute changes. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and central venous catheters.
3. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged ICU stay and steroid use.
4. Nosocomial infection due to central venous catheters or urinary catheters.
5. Fluid overload or congestive heart failure due to negative fluid balance and high output.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, medications, or fluid overload.
7. Electrolyte im"

   Metabolic Alkalosis: likely [**3-11**] diuresis, (chloride loss), replete
   chloride with KCl.
   ##  Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient looks very
   comfortable, no-longer tachypneic,  sat
ing extremely well.
   -Would diurese back to even for LOS
   .
   ##. ? Seizures: Unclear if patient was ever seizing, neurology raised
   the point that his recent bleed is a nidus, and would be a good
   indication for prophylactic antiseizure meds.
   .
   ##   Hyponatremia/ARF
 Improved, may represent volume contraction from
   lasix or improved renal function with bactrim stopped.
   -follow
   .
   ##. ? Sinusitis: drainage resolved,   would stop antibiotics at this
   point.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - ppx meds
   .
   ##. Tachycardia: Patient looks calm, did not admit to pain, may
   represent intravascular volume depletion.
   .
   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**3-11**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to
   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 11322**] and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10265**]
s note and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 11322**] is well known
   to me and he looks quite good from a resp standpoint, now 36 hr post
   extubation.  The exact etiology of his resp failure event is not
   entirely clear. He lives on the brink of resp insufficiency due to what
   I believe is pulmonary GVHD and skin/chest wall GVHD.  However he had
   altered mental status and may have been fluid overloaded which
   contributed to his decline.  His mental status is now clear and he
   fairly relaxed and he
s on Keppra prophylaxis for his gliosis in CNS
   from prior XRT.  His lung disease and work of breathing has resulted in
   his retaining C02, but his pH is fine today. I would favor gentle low
   dose p.o. Ativan to allay dyspnea.  I would agree with continuing some
   lasix p.o., but would be careful to not overdiurese.  He should be
   ready to go to an oncology floor that knows him later today.  For now
   he remains full code.
   35 min spent in the care of this severely ill patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, chronic hypoxemia, metabolic alkalosis, tachycardia, alteration in nutrition, delirium/confusion, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU due to complications from a bone marrow transplant. The patient's recent events include diuresis, extubation, improvement in mental status, and initiation of seizure prophylaxis with Keppra. He is also taking lasix for fluid management and has been on outpatient prednisone for chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and chronic hypoxemia, which may lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Seizures: The patient has been prescribed prophylactic antiseizure medication due to the risk of seizures, possibly related to the previous radiation therapy (XRT).
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may require correction with potassium chloride (KCl).
4. Hyponatremia/ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's hyponatremia may improve with the cessation of antibiotics (bactrim) and possibly represent volume contraction from lasix or improved renal function.
5. Sinusitis: The patient had resolved drainage, and antibiotics"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient is currently extubated and diuresing well, with improved mental status. The patient has a history of malignancy and has undergone a bone marrow transplant. They are currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and anti-seizure medication. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. Fluid balance shows a significant intake-output discrepancy. Respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with maintained SpO2 levels. Physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. Lab results indicate various abnormalities including leukocytosis, anemia, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and hypoxemia indicates a risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. Alkalosis, Metabolic: The elevated bicarbonate levels suggest the presence of metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, neuromuscular irritability, and seizures.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be a response to infection, sepsis, or other underlying conditions. Prolonged tachycardia can lead to cardiovascular complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood"
