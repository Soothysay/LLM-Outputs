   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anxiety who presents with abdominal pain. He has been diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and is currently being managed in the ICU. The patient's medical history also includes previous treatment for MAC infection related to asbestos exposure, but he has chosen to discontinue treatment due to side effects.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1Â°C, blood pressure ranging from 94/43 mmHg to 133/80 mmHg, heart rate between 75 and 114 bpm, respiratory rate of 12-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. His blood glucose level is well-controlled without insulin.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), elevated total bilirubin level, and slightly decreased albumin level. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected infection, and his pain is being managed with pain control medications. He is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) until after the planned percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) procedure, which will be performed today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's infection, development"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and asbestos exposure.
- He presents with abdominal pain and is found to have transient hypotension, transaminitis, and signs of cholecystitis.
- The patient has been febrile and transiently hypotensive in the emergency department.
- A HIDA scan was performed, which showed significantly delayed visualization of the small bowel and non-visualization of the bile ducts, suggesting cholestasis.
- The patient's INR is still elevated at 2.1, so he was given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and ordered vitamin K.
- The patient is currently on NPO (nothing by mouth) status for possible percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) today.
- He has a history of chronic coumadin use, so his INR has been elevated.
- The patient has a severe aortic stenosis based on an echo, so Lasix has been held.
- He is being monitored for cardiac issues, including atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
- The patient has a history of asbestos exposure and has been treated for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in the past."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe aortic stenosis who has been admitted to the ICU for cholecystitis. He has a history of allergies to penicillins, iodine, and a rash reaction. His medical history includes atrial fibrillation, controlled on sotalol, and a history of severe aortic stenosis. He is currently on multiple medications including statins, PPI, fexofen, Flagyl, aztreonam, vancomycin, and sotalol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current presentation of cholecystitis.

24-hour events include a gallbladder scan (HIDA) scan and an EKG. The patient has received various antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole. He has also been receiving ICU medications such as furosemide and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.6Â°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94-138 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is hemodynamically stable but has a history of falling bicarbonate levels and falling platelets, which are concerning for worsening sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with abdominal pain and signs of cholecystitis. The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided cholecystostomy, but the bile is draining clear. He is running a low-grade temperature, and his AST and ALT levels are coming down. The physical examination is unimpressive, and his blood pressure is stable. The patient's platelet count and bicarbonate levels have leveled off after the cholecystostomy. The healthcare team is searching for other causes of fever and abdominal discomfort. They plan to check electrolytes and liver function tests, send bile for acid-fast bacilli smear, follow up on CMV, EBV, and influenza DFA and culture data, continue antibiotics (aztreonam, flagyl, and Vanco) for another day, and consider magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) per endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) recommendations if the patient decompensates or continues to spike.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, heart failure, and asbestos exposure. He presents with abdominal pain and signs of cholecystitis. The patient has been treated for MAC infection in the past but has chosen to discontinue treatment due to side effects. He is currently experiencing fever, hypotension, and transaminitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's low-grade temperature and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection. The treating physicians have prescribed antibiotics (ciprofloxacin changed to aztreonam) to address this.
2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the emergency department, possibly due to sepsis secondary to cholecystitis or ascending cholangitis. The current blood pressure is stable, but close monitoring is required.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is being controlled with sotalol. Reversal of anticoagulation is necessary for the planned procedure.
4. Chronic Pain: The patient experiences both acute and chronic pain, requiring ongoing pain management.
5. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which will need to be managed during the procedure.
6. Asbestos Exposure: The patient has been treated for MAC infection due to asbestos exposure, but has discontinued treatment. Lung function may"

 CHOLECYSTITIS, ACALCULOUS
   -          pursue percutaneous drainage today once INR is corrected
   -          continue antibiotics
   -          hold statin given elevated transaminases
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis, fever, and liver function test (LFT) abnormalities. He has been diagnosed with cholecystitis, but the appearance of his bile and resolution of gallbladder wall edema argue against this diagnosis. The patient's platelet count has dropped, and he is experiencing thrombocytopenia. Other concerns include atrial fibrillation (AFIB) controlled on sotalol, aortic stenosis, low bicarbonate levels, and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholecystitis: The patient was initially diagnosed with cholecystitis, but the recent improvement in his symptoms and resolution of gallbladder wall edema suggest that this may not be the case. However, if the condition recurs or is confirmed, potential complications could include gallbladder rupture, infection, or sepsis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly, leading to thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding or bruising, and if severe, may require intervention such as platelet transfusion.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is being treated for AFIB with sotalol. If the rhythm control is not effective or if there are side effects from the medication, the patient may experience episodes of irregular heartbeat, which can increase the risk of blood clots"

 CHOLECYSTITIS, ACALCULOUS
   -          This diagnosis is probably the most likely.  However, it is
   not completely certain.
   -          Substantial improvement in bilirubin, etc., immediately
   following drainage suggests that this was the right course to pursue.
   -          Holding statin given elevated transaminases
 should resume
   in future.
 FEVER
   -          Given improved appearance of GB on ultrasound and negative
   bile g/s, reasonable to assess for other etiologies
   -          Follow up cultures
   -          Send bile for AFB, given pt

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis, who presented with fever and liver function test abnormalities. He was found to have a platelet drop, but other parameters have improved. The initial assessment suggested cholecystitis, but subsequent improvement in bilirubin levels following gallbladder drainage suggests that the correct course of action was pursued. Other potential causes for his fever and LFT abnormalities are being considered. The patient's atrial fibrillation is controlled with sotalol, and he has severe aortic stenosis requiring careful preload management. He also has thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to sepsis or antibiotic use, and his acidosis has resolved. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of cholecystitis. The patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystotomy without incident. The gallbladder wall edema appeared to have improved, but the bile did not appear grossly infected. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, iodine, and iodine-containing compounds, resulting in rash. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 11/16/2170 at 4:00 PM, vancomycin on 11/17/2170 at 7:55 PM, metronidazole on 11/18/2170 at 4:00 AM, and aztreonam on 11/18/2170 at 4:09 AM.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 141/68 mmHg to 162/90 mmHg, heart rate between 73-104 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received several medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, furosemide, and others.
