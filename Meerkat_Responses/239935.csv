","The patient's chief complaint is hypotension. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone CABG in 2013 and stenting in 2016. The patient also has a known gastric ulcer and is currently on amiodarone and core for his cardiac condition. 

The patient presented to the hospital with acute renal failure, right heart failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The physical examination reveals sinus bradycardia, hypotension, and negative pulsus paradoxus. The patient's urine output is low, and there is a question mark regarding the patient's blood pressure readings.

The patient has a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. There is evidence of fluid overload with elevated jugular venous pressure, liver congestion, ascites, and lower extremity edema. The patient also has moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is suspicion of prerenal azotemia secondary to hypovolemia. The patient's blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio is high, suggesting pre-renal causes. Additionally, there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis due to hypoperfusion.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, suggesting hepatic congestion due to right heart failure. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with elevated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio. 

The patient has a history"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF) due to right heart failure (RHF). The patient has been receiving amiodarone but has bradycardia and is likely intravascularly hypotensive. He also has fluid overload with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), liver congestion, ascites, and lower extremity (LE) edema. The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and worsening ARF, which is suspected to be prerenal with a BUN-to-creatinine ratio greater than 20. There is also a possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypoperfusion. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma (MGUS), which could contribute to the ARF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Right Heart Failure (RHF): The patient's RHF can result in poor forward flow from the left ventricle, causing liver congestion, ascites, and LE edema.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is suspected to be prerenal due to dehydration and hypoperfusion, but there is also a possibility of AT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with hypotension for six weeks, guaiac positive stool, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic and diastolic biventricular heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock. The cause of the heart failure exacerbation is unclear, with possibilities including persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation. The patient's current medications include milrinone for inotropic support, phenylephrine to maintain peripheral tone, lasix drip to maintain urine output, and cephalexin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Biventricular Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is causing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Right Knee Effusion: The patient has evidence of right knee effusion with signs of inflammation. Further evaluation and treatment are required to determine the underlying cause.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has AKI with a pre-renal etiology likely due to poor forward output from heart failure. Continuing heart failure treatment and considering a renal consult if creatinine does not improve are important steps.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding/Ulcers: The patient has known gastric ulcers and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for any evidence of"

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, presenting with hypotension for six weeks, guaiac positive stool, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute on chronic systolic and diastolic biventricular heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock. The cause of his acute worsening of heart failure is unclear, with possible etiologies including persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation. The patient is receiving inotropic support with milrinone and phenylephrine to maintain peripheral tone, as well as a lasix drip to maintain urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has evidence of acute kidney injury, likely due to pre-renal causes related to poor forward output from heart failure. There is no additional insult suggesting intrinsic renal disease. The plan is to consider a renal consult if diuresis and inotropic support do not improve kidney function.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding/Ulcers: The patient has known gastric ulcers, and there is concern for ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly contributing to anemia. The plan includes providing supportive care, holding aspirin, and following up with a gastroenterology consult.

   and ARF.
   1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic BiVentricular HEART FAILURE
   leading to CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
   Etiology of his acute worsening of his heart failure is unclear.
   Differential includes persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation,
   although precipitant is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 6188**] were negative for clot. Plan is
   the following:
   - continue milrinone for inotropic support with phenylephrine to
   maintain peripheral tone.
   - aim for MAP goal of 50
   - continue lasix drip to maintain urine output with goal of 2L negative
   today
   - consider adding metolazole 5mg [**Hospital1 **] to achieve goal urine output
   2. Right Knee Effusion
   Patient has evidence of right knee effusion with exam findings
   consistent with inflammation. Etiology is unclear.
   -          will plan to tap right knee
   -          continue cephalexin for now and consider broadening coverage
   if patient has signs of infection on tap
   3. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: FeUREA suggests pre-renal etiology which is
   likely poor forward from heart failure.
   - continue heart failure treatment as described above, if creatinine
   does not improve, consider renal consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who is currently in the ICU for hypotension, guaiac positive stool, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic and diastolic biventricular heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock. The etiology of his acute worsening of heart failure is unclear, but possible causes include persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation. The patient's right knee effusion is also noted, with inflammation consistent with inflammation. The patient has evidence of acute kidney injury with a pre-renal etiology likely due to poor forward output from heart failure. Other medical issues include gastrointestinal bleeding/ulcers, suspected volume from CHF, coronary artery disease, anemia, pyuria, thrombocytopenia, localized left lower extremity injury, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and familial essential hypertension. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to acute on chronic systolic and diastolic biventricular heart failure.
2. Right knee effusion with inflammation, possibly due to infection or another underlying cause.
3. Acute kidney injury with a pre-renal etiology, likely secondary to poor forward output from heart failure.

- The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic and diastolic biventricular heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock.
- The cause of his acute worsening of heart failure is unclear, with possible etiologies including persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation.
- The patient's right knee effusion is also noted, with inflammation present but the etiology unclear.
- The patient has acute kidney injury with a pre-renal etiology likely due to poor forward flow from heart failure.
- The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding/ulcers, known gastric ulcers from a previous hospital stay.
- Ascites is suspected to be due to congestive heart failure.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and may require angiography to evaluate for graft failure or restenosis, but this is deferred due to renal impairment.
- The patient has anemia, pyuria, and thrombocytopenia, with possible causes including gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic failure from right heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's heart failure could further deteriorate, leading to increased fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's pre-renal acute kidney injury could progress to renal failure if not appropriately"

   and ARF.
    1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic BiVentricular HEART FAILURE
   leading to CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
   Etiology of his acute worsening of his heart failure is unclear.
   Differential includes persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation,
   although precipitant is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 6188**] were negative for clot. Plan is
   the following:
   - continue milrinone for inotropic support with phenylephrine to
   maintain peripheral tone.
   - aim for MAP goal of 50
   - continue lasix drip to maintain urine output with goal of 2L negative
   today
   - consider adding metolazole 5mg [**Hospital1 **] to achieve goal urine output
   2. Right Knee Effusion
   Patient has evidence of right knee effusion with exam findings
   consistent with inflammation. Etiology is unclear.
   -          [**Name2 (NI) **]lt rheum for right knee tap
   -          continue cephalexin for now and consider broadening coverage
   if patient has signs of infection on tap
   3. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: FeUREA suggests pre-renal etiology which is
   likely poor forward from heart failure.
   - continue heart failure treatment as described above, if creatinine
   does not improve, consider renal consult
   4. GIB/Ulcers: Plan per MICU Note:  HCT stable from [**4-8**] [**Location (un) 755**] stay.

   - 2 18g IV
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold ASA
   - check [**Hospital1 **] hct and will call GI if patient has any evidence of
   bleeding
   5. Ascites: Suspect volume from CHF. Can trend LFTs.
   6. CAD: Last cath in [**2176**], no CK leak initially to suggest infarction
   and no symptoms of ACS. Can consider angiography to evaluate for graft
   failure or restenosis, but would defer for now given renal impairment.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG surgery. He presented with acute decompensated heart failure and acute renal failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. He has been receiving various medications and treatments including milrinone, furosemide (Lasix), phenylephrine, and others. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient's kidney function is being closely monitored due to acute renal failure. He has a central line for administration of medications and fluids, and his blood glucose levels are being controlled. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI. There is no evidence of infection based on recent tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's condition can deteriorate further if his cardiac function does not improve or if there is an exacerbation of his underlying heart disease.
2. Progression of renal failure: The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored, and any further deterioration may require dialysis or other interventions.
3. Infection: Despite the negative wound culture, the patient is still at risk for developing infections in the ICU setting, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia needs to be monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken if any arrhythm"

   negative today if off phenylephrine
   -phenylephrine to maintain peripheral tone, weans as tolerated to aim
   for MAP goal> 50
   - continue lasix drip to maintain urine output with goal of 2-3L

   patient has any systemic signs of infection
   3. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: FeUREA suggests pre-renal etiology which is
   likely poor forward from heart failure. Creatinine improved today
   - continue heart failure treatment as described above,
   -trend Creatinine, if oes not improve, consider renal consult

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with hypotension for six weeks, positive guaiac stool, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic and diastolic biventricular heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock. The cause of his heart failure worsening is unclear, but possibilities include persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation. The patient's current plan includes continuing milrinone for inotropic support, weaning off phenylephrine, maintaining urine output with Lasix, and considering adding metolazone. An echo will be repeated in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Biventricular Heart Failure leading to Cardiogenic Shock: This condition can lead to further deterioration of heart function, hypotension, organ hypoperfusion, and potentially multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation: This can lead to continued volume overload on the left atrium and ventricle, exacerbating heart failure symptoms and potentially leading to pulmonary edema.
3. Right Knee Effusion: The presence of an effusion may indicate an inflammatory or infectious process. If infection is present, it can progress to septic arthritis, which can be a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): AKI"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with hypotension for six weeks, guaiac positive stool, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute on chronic systolic and diastolic biventricular heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock. The etiology of the heart failure is unclear but may be worsening mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient is being diuresed and will have his milrinone weaned off, phenylephrine discontinued, and continue lasix drip to maintain urine output with a goal of 2-3 liters. Metolazole may be considered if needed, and a repeat echo will be done. The patient also has evidence of right knee effusion after falling at home, which was tapped yesterday without signs of septic joint. Cephalexin will be continued, and coverage may be broadened if systemic signs of infection occur. The patient has acute kidney injury with FUREA suggesting pre-renal etiology due to poor forward output from heart failure. Creatinine continues to improve. Treatment for heart failure will be continued as described above. The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding/ulcers, ascites, CAD, anemia, pyuria, and thrombocytopenia. All these conditions will be managed accordingly. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be discharged from the ICU today."

   79 yo with PMH of CAD p/w hypotension x 6 weeks, guaiac positive stool,
   and ARF.
    1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic BiVentricular HEART FAILURE
   leading to CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
   Etiology of his acute worsening of his heart failure is unclear.
   Differential includes persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation,
   although precipitant is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 6188**] were negative for clot. Plan is
   the following:
   - continue milrinone for inotropic support with plan to wean after 3L
   negative today if off phenylephrine
   -phenylephrine to maintain peripheral tone, weans as tolerated to aim
   for MAP goal> 50
   - continue lasix drip to maintain urine output with goal of 2-3L
   - consider adding metolazole 5mg [**Hospital1 **] to achieve goal urine output
   -repeat echo in am
   2. Right Knee Effusion-Patient has evidence of right knee effusion
   after falling at homewith exam findings consistent with inflammation,
   tapped yesterday with cell count not looking like septic joint.
   -continue cephalexin for now and consider broadening coverage if
   patient has any systemic signs of infection
   3. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: FeUREA suggests pre-renal etiology which is
   likely poor forward from heart failure. Creatinine improved today
   - continue heart failure treatment as described above,
   -trend Creatinine, if oes not improve, consider renal consult
   4. GIB/Ulcers: Plan per MICU Note:  HCT stable from [**4-8**] [**Location (un) 755**] stay.

   5. Ascites: Suspect volume from CHF. Can trend LFTs.
   6. CAD: Last cath in [**2176**], no CK leak initially to suggest infarction
   and no symptoms of ACS. Can consider angiography to evaluate for graft
   failure or restenosis, but would defer for now given renal impairment.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who is currently admitted to the ICU with several acute and chronic conditions. The patient's current diagnosis includes:

1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Biventricular Heart Failure leading to Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's worsening heart failure is causing low blood pressure and inadequate blood flow to vital organs. The cause of this acute worsening is unclear, but potential factors include persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation. The treatment plan involves continuing inotropic support with milrinone, maintaining peripheral tone with phenylephrine, and managing urine output with lasix.

2. Right Knee Effusion: The patient has evidence of right knee effusion after falling at home, which was tapped yesterday. The cell count does not indicate a septic joint. The plan is to continue cephalexin for now and consider broadening coverage if the patient shows systemic signs of infection.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to pre-renal etiology secondary to heart failure. Creatinine levels have improved today. The treatment plan includes continuing heart failure treatment as described above and monitoring creatinine levels.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding/Ulcers: The patient has known gastric ulcers and stable hemoglobin concentration. The plan is to restart aspirin 81mg, provide supportive care, and restart proton"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), coronary artery disease (CAD), bradycardia, and cellulitis. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of heart failure. Upon admission, the patient had low blood pressure, low urine output, and signs of fluid overload. The patient's heart function is severely compromised with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal in origin. The patient's electrolytes and blood glucose levels are abnormal. The patient is receiving multiple medications including diuretics, vasodilators, and cardiac isotropes. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal limits. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, and his platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values are mostly within normal limits, except for elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels. The patient's physical examination reveals no new findings. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's low EF and symptoms suggest a high risk for further deterioration in cardiac function, leading to increased fluid retention and worsening heart failure symptoms."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), coronary artery disease (CAD), bradycardia, and cellulitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/47mmHg to 95/55mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient has trace bilateral lower extremity edema and right knee with erythema, tenderness, and swelling. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, decreased hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, pantoprazole, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's baseline ejection fraction (EF) of 20% indicates severe systolic dysfunction, putting him at risk for worsening heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance, pulmonary status, and symptoms of volume overload (e.g., increased jugular venous pressure, crackles on lung auscultation, peripheral edema) is essential.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest renal dysfunction. Pre-renal causes such as hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo with PMH of CAD p/w hypotension x 6 weeks, guaiac positive stool,
   and ARF.
    1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic BiVentricular HEART FAILURE
   leading to CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
   Etiology of his acute worsening of his heart failure is unclear.
   Differential includes persistent and worsening mitral regurgitation,
   although precipitant is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 6188**] were negative for clot. Plan is
   the following:
   - continue milrinone for inotropic support with plan to wean after 3L
   negative today if off phenylephrine
   -phenylephrine to maintain peripheral tone, weans as tolerated to aim
   for MAP goal> 50
   - continue lasix drip to maintain urine output with goal of 2-3L
   - consider adding metolazole 5mg [**Hospital1 **] to achieve goal urine output
   -repeat echo in am
   2. Right Knee Effusion-Patient has evidence of right knee effusion
   after falling at homewith exam findings consistent with inflammation,
   tapped yesterday with cell count not looking like septic joint.
   -continue cephalexin for now and consider broadening coverage if
   patient has any systemic signs of infection
   3. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: FeUREA suggests pre-renal etiology which is
   likely poor forward from heart failure. Creatinine improved today
   - continue heart failure treatment as described above,
   -trend Creatinine, if oes not improve, consider renal consult
   4. GIB/Ulcers: Plan per MICU Note:  HCT stable from [**4-8**] [**Location (un) 755**] stay.
   Known gastric ulcers from [**Location (un) 755**]. HCt stable.
   -restart asa 81mg
   - T and S
   - 2 18g IV
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   -check daily hct
   5. Ascites: Suspect volume from CHF. Can trend LFTs.
   6. CAD: Last cath in [**2176**], no CK leak initially to suggest infarction
   and no symptoms of ACS. Can consider angiography to evaluate for graft
   failure or restenosis, but would defer for now given renal impairment.
   -hold beta blocker in the setting of low heart rate, will restart if
   HR>75
   -continue asa, statin
   .
   7. anemia: at recent baseline.  see above re: GI bleed
   8.  Pyuria: WBC [**7-21**].  asymptomatic.
   - Culture finalized negative.
   9. thrombocytopenia: ? [**3-15**] hepatic failure from right heart failure.
   Also ? of MDS per outpatient cardiologist.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo with PMH of CAD p/w hypotension x 6 weeks, guaiac positive stool,
   and ARF.
    1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic BiVentricular HEART FAILURE
   leading to CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
   Etiology unclear: possibly worseining MR.
   Diuresing well.
   - wean milrinone
   - off phenylephrine
   - continue lasix drip to maintain urine output with goal of 2-3L
   - consider adding metolazole 5mg if needed
   - repeat echo
   2. Right Knee Effusion-Patient has evidence of right knee effusion
   after falling at home with exam findings consistent with inflammation,
   tapped yesterday with cell count not looking like septic joint.
   -continue cephalexin for now and consider broadening coverage if
   patient has any systemic signs of infection
   3. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: FeUREA suggests pre-renal etiology which is
   likely poor forward from heart failure. Creatinine continues to
   improve.
   - continue heart failure treatment as described above,
   4. GIB/Ulcers: hct stable
   -restart asa 81mg
   - T and S
   - 2 18g IV
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   5. Ascites: Suspect volume from CHF. Can trend LFTs.
   6. CAD:  Last cath in [**2176**], no CK leak initially to suggest infarction
   and no symptoms of ACS. Can consider angiography to evaluate for graft
   failure or restenosis, but would defer for now given renal impairment.
   -hold beta blocker in the setting of low heart rate, will restart if
   HR>75
   -continue asa, statin
   .
   7. anemia: at recent baseline.  see above re: GI bleed
   8.  Pyuria: WBC [**7-21**].  asymptomatic.
   - Culture finalized negative.
   9. thrombocytopenia: ? [**3-15**] hepatic failure from right heart failure.
   Also ? of MDS per outpatient cardiologist.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, presenting with hypotension for six weeks, guaiac positive stool, and acute renal failure. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions including acute on chronic systolic and diastolic biventricular heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock, right knee effusion, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding/ulcers, ascites, coronary artery disease, anemia, pyuria, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Biventricular Heart Failure leading to Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's heart failure is worsening, possibly due to mitral regurgitation. The plan is to wean off milrinone and phenylephrine, continue lasix drip to maintain urine output, and consider adding metoprolol if needed. A repeat echo will be done.
2. Right Knee Effusion: The patient has evidence of right knee effusion after falling at home with exam findings consistent with inflammation. The knee was tapped yesterday, and the cell count does not indicate a septic joint. The patient is currently on cephalexin, and coverage may be broadened if there are systemic signs of infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to pre-renal etiology related to heart failure. Creatinine is improving, so"
