   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with an unfortunate history of
   TPN-dependence leading to many complications of intravenous lines
   including infection, clots, etc.
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; covering
   with cefepime, adding fluconazole given recent hx of Mallasezia
   bacteremia. Watery ostomy output, vomiting earlier, may be volume down.
   - continuing cefepime
   - started fluconazole per discussion w ID
   - giving IVF as tolerated; difficult to give IVF and pressors
   simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other access
   available
   - levophed if not able to resuscitate with IVF
   - cultures pending
   .
   FEMORAL ACCESS
   ?of whether to revise this line. Have held plavix in the meantime.
   Concern for being off plavix would be for clotting the line; and/or
   extending existing clots.
   - consider lovenox while considering revising the line
   - restart plavix if deciding to treat through and keep the current line
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - trying short-term lovenox
   - monitor for side effects
   - restart plavix if not intending to revise the line
   .
   ANEMIA
   Lower than usual; some IVF; concern for GI bleed.
   - guaiac ostomy output
   - transfuse

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence and multiple complications related to intravenous lines, including infection and clots. She presents with hypotension, fever, watery ostomy output, and vomiting. The hypotension may be related to infection, and she is being covered with cefepime and fluconazole. She is also receiving IV fluids as tolerated, but it is difficult to give both IV fluids and pressors simultaneously due to limited access. Levophed is being considered if the patient cannot be resuscitated with IV fluids. Cultures are pending.

There is a concern regarding the femoral access line, with a decision to revise or continue with the current line. Plavix has been held temporarily due to the risk of clotting the line or extending existing clots. Lovenox is being considered as an alternative while revising the line, and Plavix will be restarted if the decision is made to treat through the current line.

The patient has a past history of pulmonary embolism and is not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions and difficulties with absorption. Lovenox was previously stopped due to side effects of welts and bleeding. Plavix is currently being used for stents, but it was held on admission due to concerns about revising the line. Lovenox is being tried on a short-term basis, and the patient will be monitored for side effects. Plavix will be restarted"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence and multiple complications related to intravenous lines. The patient is currently in the ICU and experiencing several medical issues.

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and has a history of fever. It is suspected that the hypotension may be related to an infection. The patient is being covered with cefepime and fluconazole, which were initiated due to recent history of Mallasezia bacteremia. The patient is also receiving IV fluids as tolerated, but it is challenging to administer both IV fluids and pressors simultaneously.

2. Femoral Access: There is a concern regarding the femoral access line. The decision to revise this line needs to be made, considering the potential clotting risk. Plavix has been held temporarily, and lovenox may be considered while considering the line revision. If the line is treated through and not revised, Plavix can be restarted.

3. Past Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions and difficulties with absorption. Lovenox was previously stopped because the injections caused welts, which bled. The patient is currently on Plavix for stents in place, but it was held upon admission due to concerns about revising the line. Lovenox is being tried temporarily, and Plavix can be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence, leading to various complications such as infections and clots in intravenous lines. She presents with hypotension, fever, watery ostomy output, vomiting, and difficulty in giving IV fluids and pressors simultaneously due to limited access. The patient also has a sub-acute stroke, word finding difficulty, and areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast in the left basal ganglia and cerebellum. There is concern for thromboembolism or septic embolism. The patient has a history of femoral access, past pulmonary embolism, anemia, and malassezia bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be related to infection or volume depletion. It is being covered with cefepime and fluconazole. Norepinephrine is being given for blood pressure support, but there are difficulties in giving IV fluids and pressors simultaneously.

2. Sub-acute Stroke: The patient's word finding difficulty is a new finding within the last week, noted by both the patient and family. The CT head without contrast shows areas of hypodensity in the left basal ganglia and cerebellum. There is concern for thromboembolism or septic embolism.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) dependence, leading to various complications including infections and blood clots. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical issues.

The patient is experiencing hypotension, possibly related to an infection. She has been covered with antibiotics (cefepime) and antifungal medication (fluconazole) due to a recent history of Malassezia bacteremia. Her ostomy output is watery, and she has been vomiting prior to admission.

The patient also has a sub-acute stroke, as evidenced by word finding difficulty that has been progressive over the past few weeks. A head CT scan shows areas of hypodensity in the left basal ganglia and cerebellum. There is concern for thromboembolism or septic embolism, and neurology consulting has been requested.

There are concerns about the patient's femoral access line, with the decision pending on whether to revise it. The patient has a history of bleeding complications with previous use of low molecular weight heparin (lovenox).

The patient has a past history of pulmonary embolism and is currently on Plavix for stents. However, Plavix was held on admission due to concerns about revising the line. It is planned to restart Plavix if the decision is made not to revise the line.

The patient is anemic, with lower than usual hem"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypotension, anemia, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). They have been receiving norepinephrine infusion and levophed overnight. Urine output is good with the administration of approximately 5L of IV fluid. The patient's Hct has decreased to 19. There is a concern for possible evidence of CVA in the cerebellum and basal ganglia based on the head CT. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications, including seizures with Demerol, rash with Compazine and Reglan, blisters with Betadine Surgi-Prep, hives and nausea/vomiting with Vancomycin, and red man syndrome with antibiotics. They are currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion to vital organs, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Anemia: With a hemoglobin level of 6.2 g/dL, the patient is significantly anemic. Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, resulting in fatigue, weakness, and potential organ damage.
3. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The presence of a possible CVA in the cerebellum and basal ganglia increases the risk of neurological deficits, such"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   .
   - Levophed weaned off at [**2136**] and vasopressin is infusing.
   - 1 unit of PRBC for a Hct of 19 after was 24
   - - pt had one episode in the late evening of sudden crampy pain that
   woke her up from sleep, initially felt in the neck but then felt all
   the way down her back, more in the midline; neuro exam did not seem to
   show any changes, pt's mental status still intact, negative signs for
   meningitis
   - Had meeting with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] and ID team regarding lines/access
   and decided the following:  pt will get IR procedure today to try to
   place 4-lumen line temporarily (likely will change out old tunneled
   catheter over a wire)-- Note: this 4-lumen line will just be temporary
   bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be replaced with a
   double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - Of note, Blanch [**Doctor Last Name 1112**] states that pt may not be getting appropriate
   line care at home; pt states that she is doing all the line care
   herself (but she is comfortable at home and would not want to have to
   live elsewhere), but her sister has alluded to the idea that she her
   line care has not been ideal (unclear
   - Neuro Recs: suggested putting her on subq heparin and get a TTE
   1.) not convinced that she had stroke -- they think it may be
   infectious and wish for us to do an LP and check cytology, cultures,
   cell count diff, which we have not done because we are not sure that it
   will change management, so holding off
   2.) TEE for vegetations (TTE did not show vegetations)
        - Pt agrees to TEE as long as she can get anesthesia
   3.) C-spine Xray to R/O cervical spondylosis as cause of increased
   right hand weakness (unclear hx whether right arm weakness is acute or
   old)
   - ID Recs:
   1.) Broaden antibiotics further by changing them to Daptomycin,
   Meropenem, and Ambisone (from Dapto, Cefepime, Micafungin)
   2.) consider getting 3 C.diff toxin tests, rather than just 1

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - levophed not compatible w cefepime; pt cannot tolerate antibiotics
   through same port as levophed -- gets headaches and feels badly good
   response to levophed but will transition to vasopressin
   -  IR procedure schedule today to change out TPN line to temporary 4
   lumen; temporary bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be
   replaced with a double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - giving IVF as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro consulting and will follow- Non-con
   Head CT showed 2 areas of concern for subacute stroke
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman line and
   Have held plavix in the meantime. Concern for being off plavix would be
   for clotting the line; and/or extending existing clots, risk of new
   stroke or extension of stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   - restart plavix if deciding to treat through and keep the current line
   - no plan to change line for now, awaiting culture data
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix once line placement is complete
   - pt has had a reaction to lovenox in past
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs
   - monitor daily Hcts
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access

1. HYPOTENSION: The patient has been experiencing hypotension associated with fever. Antibiotics have been changed according to ID recommendations. There is concern about another Malassezia infection due to the patient's recent history of Malassezia bacteremia.

2. SUB-ACUTE STROKE: The patient has difficulty finding words, which is a new symptom over the last few weeks. Areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast in the left basal ganglia and left cerebellum are observed. This suggests concern for thromboembolism or septic embolism. An echocardiogram (TEE) will be done to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro.

3. ACCESS: The patient has difficult access with TPN/Hickman line. Subcutaneous heparin has been started due to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, as the patient has a history of bleeding with lovenox. Plavix has been held temporarily.

   - Had meeting with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] and ID team regarding lines/access
   and decided the following:  pt will get IR procedure today to try to
   place 4-lumen line temporarily (likely will change out old tunneled
   catheter over a wire)-- Note: this 4-lumen line will just be temporary
   bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be replaced with a
   double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - Of note, Blanch [**Doctor Last Name 1112**] states that pt may not be getting appropriate
   line care at home; pt states that she is doing all the line care
   herself (but she is comfortable at home and would not want to have to
   live elsewhere), but her sister has alluded to the idea that she her
   line care has not been ideal (unclear
   - Neuro Recs: suggested putting her on subq heparin and get a TTE
   1.) not convinced that she had stroke -- they think it may be
   infectious and wish for us to do an LP and check cytology, cultures,
   cell count diff, which we have not done because we are not sure that it
   will change management, so holding off
   2.) TEE for vegetations (TTE did not show vegetations)
        - Pt agrees to TEE as long as she can get anesthesia
   3.) C-spine Xray to R/O cervical spondylosis as cause of increased
   right hand weakness (unclear hx whether right arm weakness is acute or
   old); canceled b/c can
t take downstaris and can
t do bedside.
   - ID Recs:
   1.) Broaden antibiotics further by changing them to Daptomycin,
   Meropenem, and Ambisone (from Dapto, Cefepime, Micafungin)
   2.) consider getting 3 C.diff toxin tests, rather than just 1

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - levophed not compatible w cefepime; pt cannot tolerate antibiotics
   through same port as levophed -- gets headaches and feels badly good
   response to levophed but will transition to vasopressin
   -  IR procedure schedule today to change out TPN line to temporary 4
   lumen; temporary bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be
   replaced with a double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - giving IVFs as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro consulting and will follow- Non-con
   Head CT showed 2 areas of concern for subacute stroke
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman line and
   Have held plavix in the meantime. Concern for being off plavix would be
   for clotting the line; and/or extending existing clots, risk of new
   stroke or extension of stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   - restart plavix if deciding to treat through and keep the current line
   - no plan to change line for now, awaiting culture data
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix once line placement is complete
   - pt has had a reaction to lovenox in past
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs
   - monitor daily Hcts
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access

   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Will attempt to wean
   vasopressin
   -  IR procedure schedule today to change out TPN line to temporary 4
   lumen; temporary bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be
   replaced with a double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - giving IVFs as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   now. Plan for double lumen to be replaced by quad today by IR
   - IR procedure pending
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  pending above
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) dependence, who presents with various complications related to intravenous lines, including infection and clots. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, possibly related to infection, and has been switched to Daptomycin, Meropenem, and Ambisone per ID recommendations. There is concern about another Malassezia infection due to the patient's recent history of Malassezia bacteremia.

The patient also has watery ostomy output, C-diff negative, vomiting prior to admission, and may still be volume depleted. A dedicated TPN line is being used to infuse antibiotics in the context of the need for antibiotics and pressors, and the inability to transfuse together. The patient has been weaned off of levophed and is now on vasopressin. An attempt will be made to wean vasopressin.

An interventional radiology (IR) procedure is scheduled today to change out the TPN line to a temporary 4-lumen line, which will be replaced with a double lumen catheter before the patient can return home. The patient will continue on Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [8-25]), and Daptomycin (Day 1 [8-24]).

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2146-8-25**] 08:22 AM
   - cortisol was normal this AM
   - Concern for septic emboli -- if anticoagulated more and has septic
   emboli, then the septic emboli could cause bleeding; however, she does
   have many stents
   - pt has had a reaction to lovenox in past
   - Non-con Head CT showed 2 areas of concern for subacute stroke.  Neuro
   suggested putting her on subq heparin and get a TTE
   - Neuro Recs:
   1.) not convinced that she had stroke -- they think it may be
   infectious and wish for us to do an LP and check cytology, cultures,
   cell count diff, which we have not done because we are not sure that it
   will change management, so holding off
   2.) TEE for vegetations (TTE did not show vegetations)
   3.) C-spine Xray to R/O cervical spondylosis as cause of increased
   right hand weakness (unclear hx whether right arm weakness is acute or
   old)
   - Levophed at 0.15mcg/hr this AM
   - levophed not compatible w cefepime; pt cannot tolerate antibiotics
   through same port as levophed -- gets headaches and feels badly
   - Plan to wean off levophed today and start vasopressin (through same
   line), goal MAP >60
   - Had meeting with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] and ID team regarding lines/access
   and decided the following:  pt will get IR procedure tomorrow to try to
   place 4-lumen line temporarily (likely will change out old tunneled
   catheter over a wire)-- Note: this 4-lumen line will just be temporary
   bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be replaced with a
   double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - Of note, Blanch [**Doctor Last Name 1112**] states that pt may not be getting appropriate
   line care at home; pt states that she is doing all the line care
   herself (but she is comfortable at home and would not want to have to
   live elsewhere), but her sister has alluded to the idea that she her
   line care has not been ideal (unclear)
   - ID Recs:
   1.) Broaden antibiotics further by changing them to Daptomycin,
   Meropenem, and Ambisone (from Dapto, Cefepime, Micafungin)
   2.) consider getting 3 C.diff toxin tests, rather than just 1
   - transfused 1 unit PRBCs for Hct 19 through TPN line
   - stoma output stool studies sent: bicarbonate <5 (not wasting bicarb
   in stool)
   - Will Use LR as fluid rather than NS
   - Need to call Cardiology in AM to 1.) schedule TEE (already ordered)
   2.) see if regular TTE gives any indication of PFO... if not, consider
   that she may need bubble study
   - Pt agrees to TEE as long as she can get anesthesia
   (she is already getting anesthesia for IR procedure tomorrow - would
   have to coordinate to see if IR would be ok w Cards doing TEE after
   their procedure in the IR suite... unlikely.  Cards would also have to
   be willing to do so.  #[**Numeric Identifier 10170**] is TEE fellow pager)
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access
   --> also need to call anesthesia in AM to move up line placement in
   their schedule b/c her improved access is so important to get before
   the weekend
   - pt had one episode in the late evening of sudden crampy pain that
   woke her up from sleep, initially felt in the neck but then felt all
   the way down her back, more in the midline; neuro exam did not seem to
   show any changes, pt's mental status still intact, negative signs for
   meningitis

   with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] to discuss ability to use dedicated TPN line for
   other infusions
   - continue cefepime, daptomycin
   - continue fluconazole per discussion w ID
   - giving IVF as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - started levophed given SBPs in 70s despite 5 L volume
   rescuscitation.  good response to levophed but will transition to
   vasopressin

   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2146-8-26**] 01:00 PM
   tip of 20 cm cath is in lt illiac vein,. placed in IR with tip just
   before entering stent in IVC
   - Access: IR procedure to get temporary Quad-lumen done. Placed quad in
   a stent and left existing femoral in place. Can't use TPN in new quad
   b/c will clog up in stent. So, old femoral will be dedicated to tpn and
   new quad will be for everything else.
   - temporarily off vasopressin (about one and a half hours) then became
   hypotensive even after fluid boluses. Re-started vasopressin and
   continued fluid boluses. Got 2 L NS and 1 L of LR.
   - final TTE IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant
   regurgitant valvular disease seen. Normal global and regional
   biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Can re-start plavix 48 hours s/p quad placement as if anything
   happens to quad it will happen in 48 hours per IR. Also consider
   holding if getting TEE on Monday.
   - pt will need to get another procedure to replace Quad-lumen to get
   Double-lumen catheter again before leaving the hospital
   - TEE to look for vegetations will happen on Monday; cards couldn't do
   it Friday.
   - c. diff #3 pending
   - Did not give boluses overnight b/c doesn't have a foley. In AM, try
   giving a bolus of LR if still not off pressors.
   - FSBS in 260s overnight with TPN. Gave 4 units of regular insulin.
   Should touch base with nutrition in AM...insulin in TPN?

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Will attempt to wean
   vasopressin
   -  IR procedure schedule today to change out TPN line to temporary 4
   lumen; temporary bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be
   replaced with a double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - giving IVFs as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   now. Plan for double lumen to be replaced by quad today by IR
   - IR procedure pending
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  pending above
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) dependence and complications related to intravenous lines, including infection and clots. She presents with hypotension, fever, and watery ostomy output. She has been diagnosed with multiple infections, including a recent history of Malassezia bacteremia. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, and IV fluids as tolerated. She has a dedicated TPN line used for infusing antibiotics when necessary.

The patient also has a sub-acute stroke, evidenced by word finding difficulty and areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast in the left basal ganglia and left cerebellum. The cause of the stroke is uncertain, with concerns of thromboembolism or septic embolism. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to evaluate for clots and vegetations.

The patient has a past history of pulmonary embolism and is not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions and difficulties with absorption. She was previously on Lovenox, but it was stopped due to bleeding complications. She is currently on Plavix for stents, which was held on admission because of concern about revising the line. Subcutaneous heparin has been started.

The patient is anemic with a stable hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL. She received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Cortisol normal.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Is currently off
   vasopressin, but will
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - Patient with hyponatremia this morning, further IV fluids will
   receive NS
   - cultures pending, but all with NGTD
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations on Monday
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   and quad lumen in left femoral as well, but placed in a stent in the
   vein so will be unable to give TPN,  but can use for
   pressors/abx/fluids
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled.""
   - on subcutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  likely post TEE on Monday
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   - will follow up prior anemia work up, especially since she is now on
   daptomycin which can cause marrow suppression
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will continue TPN now that patient has additional access, TPN through
   her original line with ethanol dwells
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access
   - will touch base with nutrition about insulin in her TPN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence and complications related to intravenous lines, including infection and clots.
- She presents with hypotension, which is associated with fever and may be related to an infection. She has been switched to Daptomycin, Meropenem, and Ambisome as per ID recommendations. There is concern about another Malassezia infection due to the patient's recent history of Malassezia bacteremia.
- The patient's ostomy output is watery, and C-diff is negative. She has been experiencing vomiting prior to admission, which may still be contributing to her volume status. Cortisol levels are normal.
- She was previously on levophed and is now on vasopressin. However, she became hypotensive even after fluid boluses and had to be restarted on vasopressin. She received 2 L NS and 1 L of LR.
- The patient has a sub-acute stroke, with word finding difficulty noted over the last 11 weeks. Areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast are seen in the left basal ganglia and left cerebellum. This could be due to thromboembolism or septic embolism. An MRI cannot be performed due to the placement of hardware.
- The patient has a history of bleeding with lovenox, so she has been changed from lovenox to sub-cutaneous"

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with short gut syndrome, admitted with concern for line-related sepsis. The cultures are negative to date. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Amibsome, Daptomycin, Meropenem), IVF as needed, and vasopressor support, which has been successfully weaned off. The patient's hypovolemia has improved.

Other medical issues include CVA (stroke) seen on CT scan, with minimal residual symptoms at this time. An echo will be considered to follow the exam. The patient also has anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypotension (not in shock), and pain control (acute pain, chronic pain).

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on TPN with lipids, and has two central lines: a tunneled (Hickman) line and a multi-lumen line. The multi-lumen line was placed in the left iliac vein with the tip just before entering the stent in the IVC. The patient will maintain these lines during acute illness.

Prophylaxis includes DVT (heparin SQ) and stress ulcer (npo with TPN). The patient is also being monitored for VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1 C (98.7 F)
- Heart rate: 85 bpm (66-93)
- Blood pressure:"

   HYPOTENSION
   Has currently resolved, patient with no pressor requirement since
   yesterday morning.  Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to
   infection; switched to Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID
   concerned about another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history
   of Malassezia bacteremia.  All cultures negative to date.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Is currently off
   vasopressin, but will
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1
   [**8-24**])
per ID they may pull back in the near future if cultures remain
   negative
   - cultures pending, but all with NGTD
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due to concern
   for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o bleeding with
   lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations on Monday
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   and quad lumen in left femoral as well, but placed in a stent in the
   vein so will be unable to give TPN,  but can use for
   pressors/abx/fluids
   - Plavix was held in the setting of new line from IR, but will restart
   since it is 48 hours post procedure
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled.""
   - on subcutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  today

   daptomycin which can cause marrow suppression
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.
   - will continue TPN now that patient has additional access, TPN through
   her original line with ethanol dwells
   - will adjust TPN to account for repletion of K and Mg that she has
   been receiving daily in the ICU

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) dependence and multiple complications related to intravenous lines, including infection and clots. She presents with hypotension that has resolved, likely secondary to infection, and has been treated with antibiotics. The patient is currently on vasopressin but has been weaned off levophed. She also has a sub-acute stroke with word finding difficulty, areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast in the left basal ganglia and cerebellum. There is concern for thromboembolism or septic embolism given her history of clots and bacteremia. She is unable to have an MRI due to hardware placement. The patient has difficult access for TPN, with a Hickman line and a femoral line placed in a stent. She is restarting Plavix and is on subcutaneous heparin. She has a history of past pulmonary embolism and is not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions and difficulties with absorption. She has stable anemia at 26.8% and will continue to monitor daily Hcts and follow up prior anemia work up. She will receive IVF and TPN repletion of electrolytes. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she will be called out to the floor this morning.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) dependence, which has led to complications such as infections and clots related to intravenous lines. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and potential complications:

1. HYPOTENSION: The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is no longer on vasopressor support since yesterday morning. The fever earlier may be related to an infection, and antibiotics have been switched to Daptomycin, Meropenem, and Ambisome as per Infectious Disease recommendations. The ID is concerned about another Malassezia infection due to the patient's recent history of Malassezia bacteremia. All cultures are currently negative.

2. SUB-ACUTE STROKE: The patient has word finding difficulty, which she and her family have noticed over the last few weeks. Areas of hypodensity on the CT head without contrast in the left basal ganglia and left cerebellum suggest a possible thromboembolism or septic embolism. Given the history of clots and bacteremia, there is concern for thromboembolism or septic embolism. Neurology does not believe this is a subacute stroke.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a young female with a history of short gut syndrome and chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) admitted to the ICU with sepsis and concern for line-related sepsis. The patient has shown improvement with intervention and empiric antibiotic treatment despite negative cultures to date.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation was sepsis, which has improved with treatment but could potentially recur if there are any new sources of infection or if the current treatment is ineffective.

2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require further evaluation and management.

3. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing both chronic abdominal pain and new groin pain. Adequate pain control is necessary to ensure patient comfort.

4. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): There are concerns regarding potential neurological complications, and a neurology consult has been requested. Further imaging, such as a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), may be needed to assess the situation.

5. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has some electrolyte imbalances and fluid disorder, which should be closely monitored and managed.

6. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

7. DNR/DNI Status: The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status, indicating that certain life-sustaining measures should"
