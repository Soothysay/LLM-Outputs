","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents. He underwent right hemicolectomy for perforated cecum and had an intra-abdominal abscess. The patient experienced cardiac arrest due to acute hypoxic respiratory distress and was transferred back to the ICU from the floor with signs of sepsis. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable on maintenance fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/Tachypnea/Tachycardia: The patient initially presented with fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which could be attributed to worsening abdominal abscess, ventral wound infection, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and further investigations are necessary to identify the underlying cause.

2. Blood Loss: The patient's hematocrit level decreased from 26% to 21% this morning, indicating significant blood loss. A blood transfusion has been ordered, and a non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen is pending to evaluate the extent of blood loss and identify any potential sources.

3. UTI: The patient's urine culture grew Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and he has been placed on linezolid and meropenem. Repeating urine cultures and changing the Foley catheter are recommended to prevent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He underwent a right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum and was later diagnosed with an intra-abdominal abscess. The patient suffered cardiac arrest due to acute hypoxic respiratory distress and was transferred back to the ICU from the floor with signs of sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient has an ongoing intra-abdominal abscess that requires surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy.
2. Ventral wound infection: There is a possibility of a ventral wound infection, but it appears to be under control with proper wound care.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of UTIs, including one caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and another with yeast infection. Repeat urine cultures are needed to determine the current status.
4. Sacral decubitus/sacral osteomyelitis: The patient has developed sacral decubitus and osteomyelitis, which requires further evaluation and treatment by an infectious disease specialist.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of SMV thrombosis, and appropriate anticoagulation therapy should be continued.
6. Anemia: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), who underwent right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum. The patient presented with fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia, initially thought to be due to worsening abdominal abscess. Other considerations included ventral wound infection, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient had a persistent anemia and was found to have an intra-abdominal abscess with culture positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The patient underwent IR-guided drainage of the abscess and received broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Blood Loss: The patient continues to have difficulty maintaining hematocrit levels despite receiving multiple blood transfusions. This could indicate ongoing blood loss from the JP drain or another source.
2. UTI: The patient has a history of UTI caused by VRE, and the current Foley catheter is still growing yeast. Repeating urine cultures are needed.
3. Sacral Decubitus/Osteomyelitis: The patient has a sacral decubitus with growing E. coli and VRE. Plastic surgery debrided the wound, but further treatment for osteomyelitis is required.
4. SMV Thrombosis: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), right hemicolectomy for perforated cecum, complicated by an intra-abdominal abscess that was drained via image-guided drainage. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been consistently low, indicating ongoing blood loss. This may require further investigation and treatment.

2. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a history of decubitus ulcer, which is not present at admission but may develop due to prolonged immobility or pressure on certain areas.

3. History of CVA: The patient has a history of stroke, specifically bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle CVAs, which can contribute to neurological deficits and increased risk of complications.

4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, indicating a potential underlying cardiac condition that could lead to further cardiac events.

5. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has had persistent fevers despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.

6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has a history of OSA, which can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle CVAs. He underwent a right hemicolectomy for perforated cecum and developed an intrabdominal abscess. The patient experienced cardiac arrest and was resuscitated but later developed acute hypoxic respiratory distress and was transferred back to the ICU from the floor with signs of sepsis.

The patient presented with fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia initially thought to be due to worsening abdominal abscess. Other considerations included ventral wound, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection. The ventral wound appeared clean, and the ostomy seemed noninfected. There were no signs of pneumonia, but the patient's urine appeared cloudy. The patient had undergone RLQ phlegmon IR-guided drainage on POD 0 with a Jackson-Pratt drain in place. The patient was hemodynamically stable on maintenance fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage).
2. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a history of decubitus ulcer (not present at admission).
3. CVA (Stroke, Cerebral Infarction): The patient has a history of ischemic stroke.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of recent CVA, subsequent bowel perfusion after colectomy due to intrabdominal abscess. The patient had a drain in place but was removed one week ago. The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and a repeat abdominal imaging showing increasing abscess/fluid collection. An IR-guided drain was performed, resulting in scant bloody fluid drainage. The patient's Hct dropped yesterday, and a repeat CT scan showed no clear acute bleed. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is currently holding heparin, awaiting a repeat CT scan to rule out any new bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient's Hct levels are low, indicating acute blood loss. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and ongoing bleeding risk is necessary.
2. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has developed a pressure ulcer, likely due to prolonged immobilization. This requires appropriate wound care and potential referral to a plastic surgeon for further management.
3. VRE UTI: The patient has a known colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and is currently being treated with linezolid. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection or worsening of the UTI.
4. SMV thrombosis: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and subsequent bowel perfusion post-colectomy due to intrabdominal abscess. The patient had a drain in place but was removed one week ago. The patient became febrile and tachycardic yesterday, and repeat abdominal imaging showed increasing abscess/fluid collection. Therefore, another interventional radiology (IR)-guided drain was performed, with scant bloody fluid draining. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped yesterday, and a repeat CT scan showed no clear acute bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He underwent a right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum and is currently being treated for an intra-abdominal abscess that was drained using image-guided intervention. The patient also has a persistent anemia and has received multiple blood transfusions.

The patient presented to the critical care unit with fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which were initially thought to be due to worsening abdominal abscess. Other possible causes include ventral wound infection, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's ventral wound appears clean, and there are no signs of infection around the ostomy site. However, his urine appears cloudy, suggesting a potential UTI. He has a history of anemia of chronic disease and has received four units of blood over the past two days. 

The patient's blood cultures were sent on [**2192-12-7**], along with a urinalysis (UCx) that also showed yeast. The patient has been experiencing ongoing bloody drainage from the Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain, which may indicate ongoing blood loss.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He underwent a right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum and subsequently developed an intra-abdominal abscess, which was treated with image-guided drainage. The patient also has a ventral wound that appears clean, an ostomy that is noninfected, and cloudy urine. He is currently hemodynamically stable on maintenance fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of multiple infections, including an intra-abdominal abscess, suggests a risk for further infections. The cloudy urine may indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI).
2. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia with a low hematocrit level, which has been difficult to maintain. He has received blood transfusions in the past two days.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis and has been on heparin therapy. There is also a mention of a history of factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, which increases the risk of blood clots.
4. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a sacral decubitus with growing E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE),"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He underwent a right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum and had an intra-abdominal abscess that was drained via image-guided intervention.
