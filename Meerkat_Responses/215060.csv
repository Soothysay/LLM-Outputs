   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70 yo F with COPD presenting with COPD exacerbation and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #COPD Exacerbation - most likely due to viral illness initially with
   concern for possible superimposed bacterial infection currently
   although most likely viral.  Other concern would be for possible
   pulmonary embolism given wedge shaped defect on CXR.
   -vanc/cefepime to cover broadly given failure with moxiflox x 2courses
   -solumedrol 125mg IV q6 x72 hours then taper
   -continuous xopenex nebs
   -atrovent q6
   -continue home flovent/salmeterol/tiotropium
   -monitor ABG's
   -BIPAP if needed/not protecting pH
   -heparin gtt continue until able to further eval w/CTA
   -sputum culture
   -legionella urinary antigen
   -r/o influenza
   .
   #NSTEMI - possibly due to demand ischemia in the setting of HTN on
   admission with BP 200's/150's vs ACS.  She has a baseline LBBB
   difficult to evaluate for acute changes.  She is on heparin gtt already
   due to concern for possible PE.
   -continue heparin gtt
   -asa 325
   -atorvastatin 80 daily
   -hold BB given severe COPD exacerbation
   -trend CE's
   -serial EKG's although unlikely to show much given LBBB at baseline
   .
   #Wedge shaped opacity on CXR- could be soft tissue although also
   concerning for possible PE.  Patient refused CTA in ED due to dyspnea
   and inability to lie flat.
   -continue heparin gtt for now
   -CTA when able to tolerate
   -f/u AM CXR
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, advance diet when more stable, replete lytes prn,
   maintenance IVF + boluses prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with COPD and a history of NSTEMI. She is currently in the ICU due to a COPD exacerbation and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's troponins are positive, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. She is on CPAP for respiratory support and has reduced air movement with increased work of breathing. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/48 to 155/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on BiPAP. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels. She has been prescribed multiple medications including vanc/cefepime, solumedrol, xopenex nebs, atrovent, and heparin. The patient is also being evaluated for possible PE and has a wedge-shaped opacity on her chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of increased work of breathing and reduced air movement, along with the presence of white patches on the tongue and cheek, could indicate pneumonia. The increased white blood cell count also supports this possibility.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's history of dyspnea and inability to lie flat, along with the wedge-shaped opacity on her chest X-ray, raise concerns for PE."

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 70-year-old female with COPD presenting with a COPD exacerbation and NSTEMI. She is currently in the ICU and has been on bipap most of the day and overnight. Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 99/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is receiving heparin sodium infusion and various other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The physical examination shows that she is awake and alert, using accessory muscles, speaking in sentences, and has white patches on the sides of her tongue and cheek. Her lungs are markedly reduced in air movement. The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated troponin T, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The assessment and plan include treatment for COPD exacerbation with bronchodilators and corticosteroids, coverage for possible bacterial infection with antibiotics, monitoring ABG's, and using bipap if needed. The plan also includes further evaluation for pulmonary embolism with a CT angiogram and treatment for NSTEMI with antiplatelet and cholesterol-lowering medications. The patient has a wedge-shaped opacity on the chest X-ray, which could be a soft tissue opacity or a pulmonary embolism"

The patient is a 70-year-old with COPD exacerbation and a history of anxiety, who is currently in the ICU. They have been off BIPAP for 24 hours and are on 1 liter of oxygen. The patient has a fear of undergoing a CT scan due to claustrophobia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 26 mmHg, and PaO2 of 108 mmHg. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 11/18/2157 at 08:00 PM and Cefepime on 11/19/2157 at 04:00 AM. The patient has been receiving Heparin Sodium infusion at 600 units/hour. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.9 g/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin T level of 0.24 ng/mL. The patient's electrolyte levels are as follows: sodium of 287 K/uL, potassium of 4"

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation. She was admitted with refractory symptoms of tachypnea and cough at home despite close outpatient management for COPD flare with antibiotics and prednisone. Upon arrival, the patient had mild respiratory acidosis which was responsive to BIPAP support. The patient has had significant leak of enzymes from the myocardium as well as rising lactate levels, consistent with significant stress from the acute respiratory compromise. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 85-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/49-153/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds, warm skin with no edema, and the patient being conversant and alert. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, elevated troponin T level, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), anxiety, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The plan includes continuing diltiazem PO, ASA, and heparin, and awaiting cardiology consultation. For the PE, a computed tomography angiography (CT"
