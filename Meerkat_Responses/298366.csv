   24 Hour Events:
 CARDIAC CATH - At [**2188-10-30**] 12:00 PM
   Pt went to cardiac cath after intubation on integrellin, fentanyl and
   versed.
   Found to have diffuse multi vessel disease, with severe mitral
   regurgitation and left circumflex coronary artery was stented. Pt
   required placement of IABP and starting of Dopamine.  IABP was held at
   1:1 throughout the night.
   Back in CCU pt
s swan was not working and PIVs were not able to be
   placed so pt had a left arterial line and a right IJ placed.

   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistant ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:
   - s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG findings. This morning developed
   recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   - ? ischemic changes secondary to pressors, will try to wean as rapidly
   as possible.
   - Will repeat EKG in several hours to assess effect of pressor changes.
   - tolerating IABP well but ectopy making it difficult to assess and
   providing minimal support since PVCs come on so quickly that augmented
   beats are very short.  Unable to capture 1:2.
 will start lidocaine drip to hopefully suppress ventricular ectopy.
   Also removed nonfunctioning swan. Hopefully once ectopy is better
   controlled will get better support from IABP.
   - tolerating vent well, would be able to try SBT and extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately. Will monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent catch, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction who underwent cardiac catheterization for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was started on pressors due to cardiogenic shock. The patient also experienced epistaxis, volume overload, arrhythmia, diabetes, acute renal failure, and an iodine dye allergy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands, leading to organ dysfunction and potential death if not treated promptly.
2. Arrhythmia: The patient's irregular heartbeat may progress to life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which can result in cardiac arrest.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances. This can further worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of complications.
4. Volume overload: The patient's fluid overload increases the workload on the heart and can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening cardiac function.
5. Epistaxis: The patient's nosebleed may continue or"

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction who was transferred to the hospital for cardiac catheterization due to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, stenting of the left circumflex artery, and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to cardiogenic shock. 

The patient's condition has been unstable with recurrent EKG changes, ectopy, and difficulty in assessing IABP settings. She continues to require dopamine drip and is on multiple medications including aspirin, metoprolol, clopidogrel, statin, and heparin.

The patient also has several other medical issues including acute renal failure with baseline creatinine level of 1.1 now stable at 1.5, volume overload, gastrointestinal bleed, diabetes mellitus, and iodine dye allergy. She has been treated with blood transfusion, insulin drip, and lasix to manage these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient initially presented with NSTEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting. However, she developed recurrent EKG changes in the LAD distal, indicating ongoing ischemia or another episode of NSTEMI.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI and
   triggered on the floor for uncontrolled chest pain and shortness of
   breath.  Current presentation of multi-system illness is concerning for
   cardiogenic shock.  Limited options as (1) not responsive to diuresis
   likely due to poor forward flow, (2) poor forward flow due to
   ventricular ectopy and hypofunctional bigeminy rhythm, (3) pressors
   relatively contraindicated as would worsen arrhythmia, (4) needs
   diuresis prior to cath to prevent hypoxia, (5) needs cath to correct
   issues of forward flow by revascularization and/or IABP.
   .
   NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  Patient with known CAD with
   stents in RCA and CX.  V5-6 depressions are concerning for CX lesion,
   possibly RCA.  Restenosis would likely be a/w STEs, so likely reprents
   stenosis.
   - intubated, cathed, stented and lines/IABP placed as per events above
   - tolerating IABP well but ectopy making it difficult to assess.
   - Continues to require dopamine drip, will wean as possible to limit
   contribution to ectopy/arrhythmias.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   GI Bleed: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose.
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed.
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent catch, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose
 started
   on insulin drip. Will wean to ISS as tolerated.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.

   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today.
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - Once off pump, does not need lidocaine.  Will attempt to wean
   lidocaine, but bigeminal rhythm does not allow pump to provide good
   augmentation
   - Monitor for s/s lidocaine toxicity: such as nystagmus, tremor, or
   evidence of seizure.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  Will switch to pressure support
   today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also with a mild A-A
   gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else would consider
   increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   .

   - s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG findings. This morning developed
   recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   - ? ischemic changes secondary to pressors, will try to wean as rapidly

   - Will repeat EKG in several hours to assess effect of pressor changes.
   - tolerating IABP well but ectopy making it difficult to assess and
   providing minimal support since PVCs come on so quickly that augmented
   beats are very short.  Unable to capture 1:2.
 will start lidocaine drip to hopefully suppress ventricular ectopy.
   Also removed nonfunctioning swan. Hopefully once ectopy is better
   controlled will get better support from IABP.
   - tolerating vent well, would be able to try SBT and extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin

She was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization due to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), pressors, and persistent ectopy.

The patient's current medical conditions include cardiogenic shock, epistaxis, volume overload, arrhythmia, diabetes, acute renal failure, and iodine dye allergy. The patient is intubated and sedated, with distant heart sounds, occasional crackles in the chest, soft abdomen without tenderness, and cool, edematous extremities.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 100 bpm with occasional PVCs on lidocaine drip, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 mmHg to 119/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, low platelet count of 239 K/uL, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  No longer responding to lidocaine and PVCs block IABP
   function.
   - will d/c lidocaine today and start amiodorone.  Will give prednisone
   given iodine allergy and iodine moiety in amiodorone.
   - if not able to medically manage, would consider overdrive pacing.
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today.
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, s/p integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  This acidosis persisted on
   pressure support today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also
   with a mild A-A gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else
   would consider increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for
   extubation but pt unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP
   removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately but then fell again.  Will transfuse again 1 U
   today
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responded well to lasix drip.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and stenting. She was transferred to the hospital for cardiac catheterization in the setting of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, pressors, and persistent ectopy.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. ARRYTHMIA: The patient is experiencing ventricular bigeminy and PVCs, which are not responding to lidocaine. Lidocaine will be discontinued, and amiodarone will be started with prednisone given due to iodine allergy. Overdrive pacing may be considered if medical management fails.
2. CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: The patient developed recurrent EKG changes in the left anterior descending (LAD) distribution, thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors. The goal is to wean off dopamine and remove the IABP once the patient is stable.
3. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED: The patient is tolerating ventilation well but has mild respiratory acidosis. Increasing PEEP may be considered, and the patient will need to sit up for extubation but is unable to do so due to the IABP.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - Once off pump, does not need lidocaine.  Will attempt to wean
   lidocaine, but bigeminal rhythm does not allow pump to provide good
   augmentation
   - Monitor for s/s lidocaine toxicity: such as nystagmus, tremor, or
   evidence of seizure.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  Will switch to pressure support
   today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also with a mild A-A
   gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else would consider
   increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately. Will monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.

   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  No longer responding to lidocaine and PVCs block IABP
   function.
   - will d/c lidocaine today and start amiodorone.  Will give prednisone
   given iodine allergy and iodine moiety in amiodorone.
   - if not able to medically manage, would consider overdrive pacing.
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today.
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, s/p integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  This acidosis persisted on
   pressure support today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also
   with a mild A-A gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else
   would consider increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for
   extubation but pt unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP
   removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately but then fell again.  Will transfuse again 1 U
   today
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responded well to lasix drip.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the hospital for cardiac catheterization in the setting of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and is now requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), pressors, and persistent ectopy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmia: The patient has persistent ectopy and is not responding to lidocaine. The plan is to discontinue lidocaine and start amiodarone, giving prednisone due to iodine allergy and the iodine moiety in amiodarone. Overdrive pacing may be considered if medical management fails. Dopamine, a likely source of ectopy, will be weaned off.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient developed recurrent EKG changes in the left anterior descending (LAD) distribution, thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors. Diuresis is required with the goal of maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >55, using Lasix at a rate of 20 mg/hour. The patient's renal perfusion needs to be monitored closely. Once off pressors, the plan is to wean off the pump.

3. Respiratory Failure, Intubated: The patient is tolerating mechanical ventilation well, but the ABG shows mild"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and stenting. She was transferred to the hospital for cardiac catheterization due to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), pressors, and persistent ectopy.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:
1. ARRYTHMIA: The patient is experiencing persistent ectopy, which is an irregular heart rhythm. She was initially unresponsive to lidocaine but responded well to amiodarone.
2. CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) has improved, and the IABP waves indicate improvement. The plan is to wean off dopamine, a pressor medication, and then remove the IABP.
3. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure. Recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results are acceptable, but the patient is unable to sit up, which is necessary for extubation. The IABP needs to be removed before extubation can occur.
4. EPISTAXIS: The patient experienced bleeding from the nose, known as"

   Ultrasound: No evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
   ECHO: The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen (may be underestimated due to poor technical quality). The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly depressed left ventricular
   systolic function. Preserved right ventricular function.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF.
   Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   -Goal to prepare for CABG
   - Volume status: euvolemic. Continue to watch I/Os with goal even.  No
   lasix for now.
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with dopamine
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Currently intubated, with chronic compensated CO2
   retention.  Will extubated today.
   - Ready for SBT and extubation after IABP pulled and stable.
   .
   ENT: Persistent epistaxis, with packing x 6days, now removed
   - Complete 7 days nafcillin for staph coverage.
   - Hct stable, no need for transfusion today.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 on insulin gtt.
   - Once Prednisone stopped can switch to insulin sliding scale
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently at 1.8.  Likely
   from aggressive diuresis.
   - Goal even today for I/O
   .
   HEMATOLOGY:  Leukocytosis thought to be secondary to Prednisone, no
   signs of infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and stenting. He was transferred from another hospital for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent cardiac catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. He is now off the IABP. The patient's current condition includes mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), good pressures off IABP, and persistent trigeminal rhythm. The patient is euvolemic and has been aggressively diuresed, resulting in an elevated creatinine level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of cardiogenic shock and mildly depressed LVEF indicate a risk for recurrent cardiogenic shock.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient's persistent trigeminal rhythm and history of amiodarone use suggest a risk for arrhythmias. Additionally, the patient has experienced telepacing and increased PVCs.
3. Ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, indicating a risk for ongoing ischemia.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient is currently intubated with chronic compensated CO2 retention, which increases the risk of pulmonary complications upon extubation.
5. Renal dysfunction"

   Micro: NG
   Ultrasound: No evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
   ECHO: The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen (may be underestimated due to poor technical quality). The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly depressed left ventricular
   systolic function. Preserved right ventricular function.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  No longer responding to lidocaine, switched to Amiodarone
   with good response, mostly sinus rhythm.
   - Getting prednisone given iodine allergy, and insulin drip
   - Will DC dopamine, likely contributing to ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Improved MAP and IABP waves.
   - Will wean IABP today after pressor stopped.
   - ASA, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:
   -Most recent ABG acceptable
   -Patient with need to sit up for extubation but pt unable to sit up
   secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Continued bleeding by suction of post pharynx.
   - Day 5 today s/p packing by ENT, will return to repack or remove
   packing.
   - Transfused yesterday 1U, hct acceptable for now.
   - On Nafcillin for Staph  coverage while packed
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded.
   - Aggressive diuresis while tolerating
   .
   DIABETES: Prednisone restarted, insulin drip continued.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.9.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   - will review meds for [**Location (un) **]-toxins, adjust doses
   - ? urine for eval
   .
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: thought to be secondary to Prednisone.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF.
   Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   - Goal to prepare for CABG.  CSurg consulted.
   - Volume status: euvolemic. Continue to watch I/Os with goal even.  No
   lasix for now.
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with dopamine
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Currently  ________, with chronic compensated CO2 retention.
   .
   ENT: Persistent epistaxis, with packing x 6days, now removed
   - D/C Nafcillin today as 7 day course complete
   - Hct stable, no need for transfusion today.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 on insulin gtt.
   - Once Prednisone stopped can switch to insulin sliding scale
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently at 1.8.  Likely
   from aggressive diuresis.
   - Goal even today for I/O
   .
   HEMATOLOGY:  Leukocytosis thought to be secondary to Prednisone, no
   signs of infection
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was transferred from another hospital for urgent catheterization and required intubation due to cardiogenic shock. The patient is currently off intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and is in the process of preparing for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation was cardiogenic shock, which required intubation and IABP support. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and cardiovascular function will be necessary.
2. Ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recent stent placement. He will need ongoing anti-ischemic therapy and ultimately may require CABG, potentially along with mitral valve repair if mitral regurgitation persists.
3. Pulmonary complications: The patient has chronic compensated CO2 retention and persistent epistaxis. Respiratory support may be required, and careful monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
4. Renal function: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1-1.1, but it has increased to 1.8. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary, especially considering the aggressive diuresis.

   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF at
   40-45%.  Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   - Goal to prepare for CABG, c-[**Doctor First Name 213**] consulted
   - may be volume down given relatively normal EF. Will attempt to
   rehydrate with 250 cc bolus up to 1 L
   - attempt to wean dopa
   .
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with
   dopamine.  If NSVT worsens, would resume amiodoeon
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Stable post-extubation.   Has chronic compensated CO2
   retention.  On FM 50%
   - Repeat ABG today.
   .
   ENT: Persistent epistaxis, with packing x 6days, now removed
   - Complete 7 days nafcillin for staph coverage.
   - Hct stable, no need for transfusion today.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 worse on prednisone.   Home insulin 36
   U [**Hospital1 7**], but currently NPO
   - Will start 9 U [**Hospital1 7**] with sliding scale and uptitrate as needed.
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently at 1.8.  Likely
   from aggressive diuresis.
   - will rehydrate slightly today.
   .
   HEMATOLOGY:  Leukocytosis thought to be secondary to Prednisone, no
   signs of infection.  Cultures pending

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent cardiac catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient's current condition is stable post-extubation, with chronic compensated CO2 retention. He is on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and has a SpO2 of 95%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/39 mmHg to 133/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has mild depression of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 40-45%. He is off IABP and being maintained with good pressures. The plan is to prepare the patient for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and consult cardiology for evaluation.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.1 and currently at 1.8. This is likely due to aggressive diure"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF at
   40-45%.  Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   - Goal to prepare for CABG, c-[**Doctor First Name 213**] consulted
   - may be volume down given relatively normal EF.  Continue to gently
   hydrate
   - attempt to wean dopa
   .
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with
   dopamine.  If NSVT worsens, would resume amiodoeon
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Stable post-extubation.   Has chronic compensated CO2
   retention.   ABG with good oxygenation
   .
   BACTERMIA: GPC in clusters in BCx.  Given recent nafcillin therapy and
   MRSA (+), likely MRSA bacteremia or skin contaminant.
   - Vanc pending speciation/coagulase positivity
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 worse on prednisone.   Home insulin 36
   U [**Hospital1 7**], but currently NPO
   - Will start 9 U [**Hospital1 7**] with sliding scale and uptitrate as needed.
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records);  improved, currently at
   1.4.  Likely from aggressive diuresis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the ICU for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent cardiac catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient is now off IABP and has been transferred from another hospital.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PUMP: The patient previously experienced cardiogenic shock with mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40-45%. He is maintaining good pressures off IABP. The goal is to prepare the patient for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient will continue to be gently hydrated and attempt to wean off dopamine.
2. RHYTHM: The patient is off amiodarone, which was not needed once off IABP. He has mildly decreased output from trigeminy but can support pressures with dopamine. If nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) worsens, amiodarone will be resumed. Once off pressors, the patient will need afterload reduction with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker to prevent ectopy.
3. ISCHEMIA: The patient is on aspirin,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and stenting. He was transferred to the hospital for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient is now off IABP.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Cardiogenic shock has resolved.
- Mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 40-45%.
- Intermittent bigeminal rhythm with occasional nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).
- Chronic compensated carbon dioxide retention.
- Good oxygenation on the ABG.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PUMP: Consider coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or repeat catheterization in the future.
2. RHYTHM: Attempt to control NSVT with electrolyte repletion and beta-blockade.
3. ISCHEMIA: Continue with aspirin, Plavix, and statin therapy.
4. PULMONARY: Continue weaning from mechanical ventilation.
5. BACTEREMIA: Vanc pending speciation/coagulase positivity, likely MRSA bacteremia or skin contaminant.

Micro:  [**2188-11-5**] 11:11 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Line-aline.
   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    ISOLATED FROM ONE SET ONLY.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricula
r hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal tec
hnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overal
l left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed. There are foca
l calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitr
[**Doctor Last Name **] valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No ma
sses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded d
ue to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
 no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**11-4**], the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comp
arison
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is reco
mmended.
IMPRESSION: very suboptimal image quality; endocarditis cannot be excluded on th
e basis of this study
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP and pressors.
    .
   GI BLEED:  Had episode of [**Doctor First Name 3809**] with falling Hct.  Patient refuses
   endoscopy.
   - Type&Cross, IV access, [**Hospital1 7**] PPI
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct, and transfuse to keep Hct > 27.
   - Monitor for further bleeding
   - Appreciate GI recs
   .
   BACTERMIA: Coag (-) staph in isolated sample, very likely to be a
   contaminant.  Echo without evidence of vegetation.  Patient unlikely to
   tolerate TEE.
   - Follow remaining cultures.
   - D/C Vanc
   .
   PUMP:  Cardiogenic shock now resolved.  Mildly depressed LVEF at
   40-45%.  Patient autodiuresing, suggesting further recovery of pump
   function
   - Would consider CABG (although likely mod-high risk) or repeat cath in
   the future, f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) 3810**] [**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Patient currently hesitant about further
   procedures.
   - would hydrate for hypotension
   - BP control with ACE and BB
   .
   RHYTHM:  Intermittant bigeminal rhythm with occasional NSVT.  Will
   attempt to control NSVT with electrolyte repletion and beta-blockade
   - metoprolol
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin, captopril and metoprolol.
   .
   PULMONARY: Stable post-extubation.   Has chronic compensated CO2
   retention.   ABG with good oxygenation.  Continue to wean.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 worse on prednisone.   Home insulin 36
   U [**Hospital1 7**], but currently NPO.  Hypoglycemic with 36 and hyperglycemic with
   18 U.
   - 24 U [**Hospital1 7**] with sliding scale and uptitrate as needed.
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records);  improved, currently at
   1.4.  Likely from aggressive diuresis.
   - will rehydrate slightly today.
   .

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. He is now off IABP and pressors.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. GI bleed: The patient had a significant melena (large, black, tarry stool) and a falling hemoglobin (Hct) level. He refuses endoscopy. The plan is to transfuse blood products to maintain Hct above 27% and monitor for further bleeding.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, which is likely a contaminant. There is no evidence of endocarditis on the echocardiogram, and the patient is unlikely to tolerate transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Follow-up cultures are being done, and vancomycin has been discontinued.
3. Pump dysfunction: The patient had cardiogenic shock that has resolved. His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is mildly depressed at 40-45%. The patient is autodiuresing, suggesting further recovery of pump function. Future plans include considering coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)"

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    ISOLATED FROM ONE SET ONLY.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricula
r hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal tec
hnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overal
l left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed. There are foca
l calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitr
[**Doctor Last Name **] valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No ma
sses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded d
ue to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
 no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**11-4**], the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comp
arison
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is reco
mmended.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and stenting. The patient was transferred from another hospital for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent cardiac catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. The patient is now off IABP and pressors.

The patient has experienced several medical complications since admission. These include:

1. GI Bleed: The patient had an episode of melena (black, tarry stools) with a falling hematocrit (Hct), indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient refuses endoscopy to further evaluate the source of bleeding.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulation-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. An echocardiogram did not show evidence of vegetation, suggesting that endocarditis may not be present.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which has since resolved. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is mildly depressed at 40-45%. The patient is autodiuresing, indicating further recovery of cardiac function.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and previous myocardial inf"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and stents. She was transferred to the hospital for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and pressors. The patient is now extubated, off IABP and pressors.

24-hour events include a multilumen stop, allergies to iodine-containing substances, Lipitor, Zocor, and codeine. She received antibiotics (Nafcillin and Vancomycin) within the last 24 hours. Her current medications include Pantoprazole (Protonix), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and others.

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs, heart rhythm in sinus rhythm, and fluid balance. Physical examination reveals general orientation and awareness, regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops, pulmonary crackles, soft abdomen, dark fingers bilaterally, and weak peripheral pulses. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and troponin-T levels, with normal creatinine, potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI BLEED: The patient had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding with falling hemoglobin levels. The patient refuses endoscopy. Type and crossmatch,"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors.
    .
   GI BLEED:  Thought to be secondary to epistaxis, transfused 1 u PRBCs,
   Hct stable.
   - GI following but pt refuses any scoping.
   .
   BACTERMIA: Vanc stopped as Coag (-) staph in isolated sample likely
   contaminant. No sign of vegetations, pt Afebrile off abx.
   .
   PUMP:  Cardiogenic shock now resolved.  Mildly depressed LVEF at
   40-45%.  Patient autodiuresing, suggesting further recovery of pump
   function
   - Would consider CABG (although likely mod-high risk) or repeat cath in
   the future, f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) 3810**] [**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Will need to reeval code status.
   - BP control with ACE and BB
   .
   RHYTHM:  Decreased ectopy, continue BB
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin, captopril and metoprolol.
   - titrate up and to long acting meds
