   76 yo F with lupus nephritis, CKD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, rectro-vag
   fistula who presented from PCP with acute respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia:  Resolving.  DDx includes infection, hypervolemia, CHF
   exacterbation.  Unclear cause, not vol o/l on exam or on imaging, CT
   with out clear consolidation though patchy infiltrates with GGO's. Got
   CTX, levo and vanc in ED. UTI on UA  - SIRS physiology could ppt acute
   respiratory distress that quickly resolved with IVF and abx. Unlikely
   that PNA would resolve so fast.  CHF not likely as improved with
   fluids.  Gas 7.41/44/290 on NRB.
   - now on 4L nc, wean as tolerated
   - will continue abx - treat UTi with cipro/flagyl given rectovaginal
   fistula
   # Hypotension: Likely SIRS physiology with UTI as precipitating event.
   Unclear what baseline bp's are, but 90-100 on floor.  Prior notes with
   bp 120-140's, and given CRF, likely runs higher.  Got 1L in ED, looked
   hemoconcentrated on hct.  Consider hypovolemia with hct drop, though
   less likely, no acute s/sx significant bleeding.
   - will bolus carefully given on HD, though makes some urine
   - abx as above with cipro/flagyl
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx
   - hold anti-HTN meds
   - T & S active, trend hct

   monitor perfusion as oliguric
   # CRF: Cr slightly up from baseline, likely slightly hemoconcentrated.
   - renal aware
   - T/TH/Sa schedule, will get it tomorrow, no urgent need tonight

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of lupus nephritis, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension (HTN), and a retro-vaginal fistula. The patient presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction
2. Chronic renal failure
3. Hypoxemia
4. Hypotension (not in shock)

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture indicating an infection. This could lead to sepsis, which is already present without organ dysfunction. Additionally, the presence of a UTI suggests that the infection might be originating from the urinary tract, especially considering the recto-vaginal fistula.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress. Although it has resolved, there is still a possibility of developing ARDS due to the underlying infection and other risk factors.

3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 300 mL. This indicates potential dehydration or fluid loss, which can further complicate the patient's condition and contribute to hypotension.

4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has a history of CKD and is on hemodialysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of lupus nephritis, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension (HTN), and a rectovaginal fistula. She presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory distress and was found to have polymicrobial bacteremia, likely originating from the RV fistula. The patient has been receiving antibiotics in the ED and in the ICU, including ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) as evidenced by positive blood cultures and urinalysis.

Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the polymicrobial bacteremia. Source control, aggressive antibiotic therapy, and supportive care are essential to manage this condition.
2. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress and required supplemental oxygen. Although her oxygen saturation has improved with nasal cannula, she may still be at risk for further respiratory complications. Close monitoring and weaning of oxygen as tolerated are recommended.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of chronic low platelet counts. Further investigation into the cause of thrombocytopenia is warranted, including assessing her response to erythropoietin therapy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of back pain. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently in the ICU. He is experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has positive blood cultures, indicating an infection. He is receiving antibiotics, specifically cefipime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient also requires magnesium repletion and morphine for pain management. There is a recommendation for a CT with gastrograffin to evaluate for a rectovesicular fistula. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 104/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, along with low hemoglobin and white blood cell count. The patient has poor dentition and is thin in appearance. Physical examination findings include poor dentition, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and present bowel sounds. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypotension, positive blood cultures, and elevated inflammatory markers suggest an ongoing infection leading to sepsis."

   # Hypoxia:  Resolving, now on 2L NC and saturating well. CT shows
   patchy infiltrates, small bilateral effusions. SIRS physiology
   (UTI/bacteremia) could have provoked acute respiratory distress that
   resolved with IVF and antibiotics. Unlikely that PNA would resolve so
   fast.  CHF not likely as improved with fluids.

   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 36, have been chronically low. Previously
   anemic RBC lines now elevated to Hct 38.4 w/macrocytosis. Could this be

   - Call patient
s PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 11286**] working up her low platelets? Is she still
   getting Epogen as part of CRF management?
    # Hypotension: Likely SIRS physiology BPs 90-100 on floor.  Prior
   notes with bp 120-140's, and given CRF, likely runs higher.  Got 1L in
   ED, looked hemoconcentrated on hct.

   # CRF: Cr slightly up from baseline looks underdialyzed vs
   hemoconcentrated.
   - HD this AM (T/TH/Sa schedule)
   - continue renagel, iron
   - renal diet
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   # Recal Bleeding/Anemia:  Hct to 35 on repeat after blood found during
   PR Tylenol dosing.  Known hemorrhoids.  GI aware, no acute need for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of lupus nephritis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, and a rectovaginal fistula. She presented to the hospital with acute respiratory distress and was found to have polymicrobial bacteremia, likely originating from the RV fistula. She received antibiotics in the emergency department and is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, which is resolving with supplemental oxygen. She has patchy infiltrates and small bilateral effusions on CT scan. She also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 36,000/mL, chronic low platelet count, anemia, and macrocytosis. There is a concern for myelodysplastic disorder.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to sepsis syndrome. Her blood pressure is stable in the range of 90-100 mmHg. She has chronic kidney disease with a slightly elevated creatinine level and is on maintenance hemodialysis. She is also being managed for anemia, lupus, gout, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial bacteremia: The patient has a polymicrobial infection, which can lead to sepsis and"

   76F with lupus nephritis, CKD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, rectovaginal
   fistula who presented from PCP with acute respiratory distress.
   # Polymicrobial Bacteremia: Source likely the RV fistula, especially in
   setting of rectal bleeding in ED. Received Ceftriaxone, Levo and Vanc
   in the ED, getting Cipro/Flagyl and Cefepime here (for GNR coverage).
   UTI on UA as well, which should be covered with current antibiotics
   - Follow-up on new blood/urine cultures
   - Will ask ID regarding coverage for GPR clostridium and bacillus
   # VTach: Brief runs yesterday. Etiology unclear but patient was in
   significant pain, recent hypoxia/hypotension with known cardiac
   disease. Responded well to Morphine and Magnesium repletion
   - Will continue to monitor closely on Telemetry
   - Re-start home beta blocker at low dose
   # Hypoxia:  Resolving, now on 2L NC and saturating well. CT shows
   patchy infiltrates, small bilateral effusions. SIRS physiology
   (UTI/bacteremia) could have provoked acute respiratory distress that
   resolved with IVF and antibiotics. Unlikely that PNA would resolve so
   fast.  CHF not likely as improved with fluids.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 36, have been chronically low. Previously
   anemic RBC lines now elevated to Hct 38.4 w/macrocytosis. Could this be
   myelodysplastic d/o?
   - Call patient
s PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 11286**] working up her low platelets? Is she still
   getting Epogen as part of CRF management?
   - Touch base with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 306**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Heme/Onc who previously saw patient
    # Hypotension: Likely SIRS physiology BPs 90-100 on floor.  Prior
   notes with bp 120-140's, and given CRF, likely runs higher.  Got 1L in
   ED, looked hemoconcentrated on hct.
   - Will bolus carefully if needed given on HD, although she makes some
   urine
   - Abx as above
   - F/u blood cx, urine cx
   - Will start low-dose beta blocker per above
   - Maintain sbp>100, tolerate non-invasive MAPs>60, cannot use UOP to
   monitor perfusion as oliguric
   # CRF: Cr slightly up from baseline - ? underdialyzed vs
   hemoconcentrated.
   - HD tomorrow (T/TH/Sa schedule)
   - Follow up Renal recs
   - Continue renagel, iron
   - Renal diet
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   # Rectal Bleeding/Anemia:  Hct stable at 35 after blood found during PR
   Tylenol dosing on admission.  Known hemorrhoids.  GI aware, no acute
   need for scope.  T & S active.
   -          Transfuse if <30 or e/o bleeding
   -          General Surgery to evaluate CT abd/pelvis with graftograffin
   to assess fistula
   # Lupus: Continue plaquenil, prednisone
   # Gout: Continue home allopurinol
   # HTN: Holding home meds given hypotension
   # CAD: s/p CABG, continue home meds of statin, ASA, Plavix.  Holding BB
   as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of lupus nephritis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension (HTN), and a rectovaginal fistula. She presented to the hospital with acute respiratory distress and was found to have polymicrobial bacteremia, likely originating from the RV fistula. The patient received antibiotics in the emergency department and is currently on ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and cefepime.

She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) that should be covered with the current antibiotics. Blood and urine cultures have been taken for follow-up. The patient's vitals show fever, tachycardia, and mild hypotension. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with a saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels. Her electrolytes show imbalances in sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time with a normal international normalized ratio.

The patient's past medical history includes CKD, CAD, HTN, lupus, and gout. She is currently on multiple medications including plaquenil, prednis"
