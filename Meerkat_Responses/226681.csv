   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.
   - Patient continues on CPAP. Ultimately, utility of NIPPV will likely
   be limited if pneumonia is his underlying issue and may need
   intubation; ok per mother.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleed, and pancreatic cyst that was drained in 2013. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and has had a complicated course. The patient now presents with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/64 mmHg to 101/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient is on CPAP and has been maintained on it during the day with stable ABG. The patient's FiO2 was weaned from 100% to 60% and then transitioned to high flow facemask for a 2-hour period but had increasing RR, so the patient was put back on CPAP at 60%. The patient has a PICC line in place for central access.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 16.8 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 8.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose at 133 mg/dL, and low albumin at 2.6 g/dL. Other labs are within normal range.

","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleed, pancreatic cyst that was drained in 2013, and now admitted with abdominal pain. The patient has had a complicated course, presenting with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient is currently on CPAP and has been extubated several weeks prior.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis, which indicates a respiratory failure. The concern is for pneumonia, specifically hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, given the new opacities on the chest X-ray and recent reintroduction of tube feeds.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of SMV thrombus and is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and bed rest. Heparin sodium is being used as prophylaxis.

3. Sepsis: The patient meets the definition of sepsis with symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The likely source of infection appears to be pulmonary. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is also a possibility, but previous paracentesis did not reveal any signs of infection.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to hyperdynamic"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.
   - Patient continues on CPAP. Ultimately, utility of NIPPV will likely
   be limited if pneumonia is his underlying issue and may need
   intubation; ok per mother.
   - serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - CT chest to evaluate for PE
   - consider A-line
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**].

","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst who was admitted with abdominal pain. He now presents with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient has respiratory failure with hypoxia, ABG showing respiratory alkalosis, and concern for pneumonia - hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) due to being bedbound and low albumin levels. The patient is on CPAP and may require intubation if pneumonia is the underlying issue.

The patient is febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea, meeting the definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is also a possibility, although he has had three abdominal taps without any complications. He may need a CT chest to evaluate for PE, and a nasopharyngeal swab for viral infection should be considered.

The patient has anemia/bleed with stable Hct levels. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and evidence of hemorrhage into the bowel wall. Trend Hct, guaiac stools, active T&S, continue pantoprazole, and iron supplement should be done.

The patient has a left humeral fracture likely due to trauma during radiology. Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn"

","The patient's chief complaint is hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is unable to provide a history, so it was obtained from medical records. The patient has no known drug allergies. 

The patient has received antibiotics (cefipime, metronidazole, and vancomycin) at different times. They are also receiving pantoprazole (protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 97/63 mmHg to 140/57 mmHg, heart rate of 134 bpm with a normal range of 118-134 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 34-55 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,604 mL and output of 590 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,014 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a high flow nebulizer and ventilator set at standby mode. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 687 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 4 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 168 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 118 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The assessment and plan include hypoxemic respiratory failure with worsening chest X-ray, the need for a CT chest to better characterize the process, broad antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and consideration of aspiration pneumonia as well. The patient's tachycardia persists despite resolution of fever and fluid boluses, so continued fluid resuscitation is recommended. Anemia/bleed, SMV thrombus, seizure disorder, and cerebral palsy are also noted, but no specific interventions are mentioned for these conditions in the provided note. 

Overall, the patient is critically ill with hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intensive care management and monitoring."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics (cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin), pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and TPN with lipids. The patient also has a PICC line in place.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 134 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/63 to 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.9 degrees Celsius.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with a total intake of 2,604 mL and output of 1,592 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,014 mL. The patient has received a total of 2,025 mL of IV fluids and lost 590 mL of blood products.

The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and standby ventilator mode. The patient's tidal volume is 687 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 4 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 100%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, hematocrit of 29%, platelet count of 168 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 118 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 0.8 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include hypoxemic respiratory failure, tachycardia, anemia/bleed, SMV thrombus, seizure disorder, cerebral palsy, and other conditions. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, infection (such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia), bleeding due to low platelet count or coagulation issues, thrombosis in the superior mesenteric vein, seizures, and complications related to the patient's underlying cerebral palsy.

It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory function, managing fluid balance, administering appropriate antibiotics, closely monitoring lab results, and addressing any other ongoing medical concerns."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Await final CT report
   - Discuss drainage with IR
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst drainage. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and developed a complicated course including new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis, concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, pleural effusion, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is intubated due to declining respiratory status.

The patient also has fever and sepsis, likely originating from a pulmonary source. There is a possibility of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to ascites, although previous paracentesis did not reveal SBP. A nasopharyngeal swab for viral infection should be considered. 

Additionally, the patient has tachycardia, which may be due to hyperdynamic state caused by fever and infection. The patient's volume status appears euvolemic, and mental status is being monitored.

Furthermore, the patient has anemia and a recent left humeral fracture, likely due to trauma during radiology. Pain control measures are in place for the fracture.

The patient's liver shows a lesion that may represent an abscess, and plans are being made for drainage. Anticoagulation therapy for SMV thrombus has been considered but was held due to recent gastrointestinal"

   - Patient maintained on CPAP during the day with stable ABG, weaned
   FIO2 from 100 to 60%, then transitioned for 2hr period to high flow
   facemask, but then increasing RR so put back on CPAP 60%
   - Required intubation for airway management.
   CT-Torso:
   Chest - There are increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  ETT
   is in satisfactory position. NGT terminates in stomach. Ascending aorta
   is ectatic. A left sided PICC line terminates in the SVC. There are no
   enlarged axillary/mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes. There is new
   development of patchy pna particularly in LUL and anterior basal
   segment of RLL. There is atelectasis. There is no PE.
   Abd - There is new ill defined hypoattenuation of segment 5 of the
   liver measuring 2.8cm x 3 cm that may represent developing abscess.
   Stable marked ascites. No evidence of SBO. There is stable thickening
   of the sigmoid colon and rectal wall.  There is a stable left RP
   hemorrhage that now appears more organized.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Await final CT report
   - Discuss drainage with IR
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed a complicated course, now presenting with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient has been intubated due to declining respiratory status and pneumonia. There are concerns for pulmonary embolism, hospital-acquired pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 78/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is alert but appears uncomfortable and uses accessory respiratory muscles. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, elevated lactate, low albumin, and elevated liver enzymes.

Imaging studies reveal moderate bilateral pleural effusions, ectatic ascending aorta, patchy pneumonia particularly in the left upper lobe, and a new ill-defined hypoattenuation in segment 5 of the liver measuring 2.8cm x 3cm, which may represent a developing abscess. There is also stable marked ascites, thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectal wall, and organized left rectal hemorrhage.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-ac"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Await final CT report
   - Discuss drainage with IR
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst who was admitted with abdominal pain. He now presents with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, pneumonia (likely hospital-acquired or aspiration), pleural effusion, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, liver lesion (possibly abscess), and a left humeral fracture.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 78/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, low hemoglobin at 8.3 g/dL, slightly elevated platelet count of 168 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal moderate bilateral pleural effusions, ectatic ascending aorta, no evidence of pulmonary embolism, new patchy pneumonia, atelectasis, stable marked ascites, possible liver abscess, and no small bowel obstruction.

The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, metron"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. However, there have been several significant events over the past 24 hours. An EKG was performed on [**2115-3-24**] at 09:10 AM. An arterial line was started on [**2115-3-24**] at 11:10 PM. The patient has been maintained on CPAP during the day with stable ABG, weaned FIO2 from 100 to 60%, and then transitioned for a 2-hour period to high flow facemask. However, the patient's increasing RR led to being put back on CPAP at 60%. The patient required intubation for airway management.

A CT-Torso was conducted, revealing increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions. The ETT is in satisfactory position, and NGT terminates in the stomach. There is ectasia of the ascending aorta, a left-sided PICC line terminating in the SVC, no enlarged axillary/mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes, new development of patchy pneumonia particularly in the left upper lobe and anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe, atelectasis, no pulmonary embolism, and stable marked ascites. There is also a new ill-defined hypoattenuation of segment 5 of the liver measuring 2.8 cm"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   - attempt weaning to PSV
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Await final CT report
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed a complicated course, including new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis, indicating possible respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia, specifically hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, due to the new opacities on chest X-ray and recent reintubation.

2. Sepsis: The patient is febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea, meeting the definition of sepsis. The likely source of infection appears to be pulmonary, but other sources such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or intra-abdominal infection should be considered.

3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the preliminary CT angiography (CTA) does not show any PE, it remains a concern given the patient's bedbound status and recent discontinuation of thromboprophylaxis.

4. Liver abscess: There is a new ill-defined hypoattenuation in segment 5 of the liver, which may represent a developing abscess.

5. Abdominal wall hematoma: The patient has evidence of a left rect"

   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
   hypokinesis suggested(LVEF = 45 %). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
   moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
..Compared with the prior study (images

","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst who presented with abdominal pain. He has had a complicated course, now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute; anemia, acute; fracture, other; tachycardia, other; fever/sepsis; and liver lesion, possible abscess.

Based on the information provided in the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's recent development of fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, along with new opacities on chest X-ray, raises concern for pneumonia. This could be healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea suggest the possibility of sepsis. The most likely source of infection appears to be pulmonary.

3. Abdominal abscess: The CT scan revealed a new ill-defined 2.8 x 3 cm hypoattenuating lesion in segment V of the liver, which may be secondary to a developing abscess. Follow-up ultrasound is recommended.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of superior vena cava (SMV) thrombus and is at risk for developing DVT. However"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a fever of 102.3 and altered mental status. The patient has been mechanically ventilated since admission due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable with episodes of hypotension and apnea. A transesophageal echo and transthoracic echo were performed, revealing a liver lesion that may be an abscess. The patient's blood cultures are already positive, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient is currently on midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, positive blood cultures, and altered mental status suggest a systemic infection, which can lead to sepsis. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's respiratory failure indicates compromised lung function. If not managed properly, this could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and lead to multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, possibly due to hemorrhage or bleeding. Continued bleeding could worsen the patient's condition and require additional interventions.
4. Liver Abscess: The liver lesion seen on imaging may indicate a liver abscess. If not treated appropriately, this can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst who presented with abdominal pain. He has had a complicated course, including new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to declining respiratory status and pneumonia. He also has a left humeral fracture, liver lesion suggestive of an abscess, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has significant hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis, indicating respiratory failure. He is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated for several weeks.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea suggest sepsis, likely secondary to pulmonary infection.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has low albumin levels, which can contribute to hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein, indicating a risk for DVT.
5. Liver abscess: The liver lesion seen on CT suggests a possible abscess, which needs to be further evaluated and managed appropriately.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and evidence of recent bleeding into the bowel wall.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old man with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and chronic pancreatitis. He was admitted with acute abdomen and peritonitis. He has been diagnosed with a superior mesenteric vein thrombus, anticoagulated, and developed retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The patient was readmitted with progressive hypoxemia and was intubated. A CT scan revealed a liver abscess, and a contrast-enhanced CT scan showed bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusions. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory alkalosis, new opacities on chest X-ray, and significant hypoxia, which may indicate pneumonia or aspiration.
2. Sepsis: The patient has fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, meeting the definition of sepsis. The source of infection is likely pulmonary, possibly due to pneumonia or aspiration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of CP (likely cerebral palsy), prolonged hospitalization for peritonitis, sepsis, respiratory failure, SMV thrombosis, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. He experienced an episode of decreased alertness and apnea yesterday evening, which has now resolved. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, phenobarbital, cefepime, lidocaine patch, flagyl, vancomycin, and protonix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia with gram-positive cocci in the sputum. There is evidence of volume overload, so diuresis will be attempted.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued to treat the pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (92/66 mmHg), indicating hypotension. This may be related to sepsis or volume overload.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level (8.9 g/dL), indicating anemia. An appropriate Hct bump with transfusion will be given.
5. Liver Abscess: A repeat ultrasound tomorrow is planned to assess the liver abscess.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.
- The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has required increasing doses of vasopressor support.
- There have been fluctuations in the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels.
- Cultures have shown presence of S. aureus and GNR, but all blood and urine cultures are pending or have shown no growth.
- The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.1 K/uL, elevated glucose levels at 157 mg/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine levels at 0.7 mg/dL.
- The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.
- The patient's nutritional support includes Vivonex (full) and TPN with lipids.
- The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and the disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis raises the possibility of sepsis. The positive cultures for S. aureus and GNR further support this concern.
2. Organ dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction, while the elevated glucose"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with ongoing management. They have been experiencing increased levophed requirement to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, but were able to wean down overnight. Fever has developed, with a maximum temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient received 40IV lasix overnight as previously discussed. They have been receiving multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient is sedated and comfortable at rest, but not fully oriented. They show signs of respiratory distress with coarse bilateral breath sounds and soft ronchi. Their heart rate is elevated, and they have distended abdomen with discomfort on palpation. The patient is warm and cachectic with bilateral lower extremity contractures. They have a central venous catheter, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, as well as renal dysfunction. X-rays show bilateral infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of recent hospitalization and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's condition remains unstable, and they are on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. They are also receiving enteral nutrition and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate bump
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst who was admitted with abdominal pain. He has had a complicated course and is now presenting with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing significant hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis in the setting of tachypnea. There are new opacities on the chest X-ray, raising concerns for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia rather than ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) since the patient was extubated several weeks prior. There is also a component of pleural effusion to the opacities.
2. Fever/Sepsis: The patient is febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea, meeting the definition of sepsis. The most likely source of infection appears to be pulmonary. Ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) are also possible, although he has undergone three abdominal taps without evidence of SBP. A preliminary CT angiography (CTA) does not show any pulmonary embolism (PE), but further evaluation is needed.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to hyperdynamic circulation in the setting of infection and fever. Volume status appears e"

   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE noted.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate (most recent ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis)
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus, GNR (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV again if continues stable
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Repeat abdominal US today to evaluate for change in liver lesion (?
   Abscess)
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR, but will F/U US report today)
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst, admitted with abdominal pain and now presenting with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient has been intubated due to declining respiratory status and pneumonia. The patient also has a history of ascites and is at risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia. Other potential complications include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for pneumonia, possibly hospital-acquired or aspiration-related.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea suggest systemic infection, likely secondary to the suspected pneumonia.
3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Given the patient's history of ascites and current fever, SBP should be considered and monitored for.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has risk factors for DVT, including immobility and recent surgery.
5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): PE is a concern in"

   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE noted.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst, and a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and developed respiratory failure, fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. There is concern for pneumonia, specifically hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, as well as a potential pleural effusion. The patient also has a history of bedbound status, which raises concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension requiring pressors, tachycardia, anemia, liver lesion possibly an abscess, and a left humeral fracture. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infections, including coverage for gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal coagulation profile.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, hepatic dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, and further deterioration of the liver lesion."

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a past medical history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst drainage, and a recent history of abdominal pain. He was admitted with respiratory failure, hypoxia, and new fever, tachypnea, and significant hypoxia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and thromboembolic events. The patient has also had several episodes of acute mental status changes and has required pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the presence of new opacities on the chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia or aspiration. There is also evidence of pleural effusion. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory parameters is necessary. Serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis should be performed to assess gas exchange and acid-base balance.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and likely pulmonary source. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and blood cultures should be followed up. Consideration should be given to obtaining a nasopharyngeal swab for viral pathogens.

3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes and total bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE noted.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate (most recent ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis)
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus, GNR (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV again if continues stable
   - Consider additional Lasix for crackles on exam
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Repeat abdominal US today to evaluate for change in liver lesion (?
   Abscess)
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR, but will F/U US report today)
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - will check drug levels tomorrow
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pancreatic cyst, and a previous surgical intervention for cyst drainage. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and developed respiratory failure, hypoxia, and fever. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition indicates multiple potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis. There is concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia due to recent reintubation and feeding tube placement. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed infiltrates bilaterally but no pulmonary embolism (PE). Serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, repeat lactate levels, and further sputum and blood cultures are recommended.

2. Fever/Sepsis: The patient has persistent fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, meeting the definition of sepsis. The most likely source of infection seems to be pulmonary, but other sources such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or urinary tract infection (UTI) need to be ruled out. Broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms have been initiated. Repeat blood and urine cultures, sputum culture, and abdominal ultrasound (US) are planned.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy (CP) who is experiencing respiratory failure, sepsis from aspiration, and other medical complications. He is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to aspiration, which increases the risk of infection spreading throughout the body and causing further complications.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, as indicated by the positive fluid balance and lower extremity edema. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which may result in inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and organ dysfunction.
5. Seizures: The patient experienced a seizure, indicating a potential risk for recurrent seizures or status epilepticus if not adequately managed.
6. Infection: The patient has positive sputum cultures for Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods, suggesting a risk of ongoing infection that needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
7. Fracture: The patient has a left humeral fracture, which may require evaluation and management by orthopedic specialists.
8. Poor Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, indicating a risk of"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier once
   extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pancreatic cyst drainage, and recent admission for abdominal pain. He has been in the ICU since March 23rd with respiratory failure and was intubated on March 24th. The patient developed a fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, leading to the initiation of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia. He also has pleural effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation.

The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, tachycardia, anemia/bleed, liver lesion, left humeral fracture, and superior mesenteric vein thrombus. The liver lesion is suspected to be either an infarct or abscess. The patient has undergone three abdominal paracenteses to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). His recent abdominal ultrasound does not support the presence of an abscess but rather suggests compromised blood supply through the right portal vein, indicating a possible liver infarct.

The patient's current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole) for HAP and aspiration pneumonia, diuretics for fluid balance management, pressors (levophed) for hypotension, and anticoagulation for the SMV thrombus. He is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off some sedatives. The patient's condition remains critical with persistent fever and unstable vital signs. The patient continues to require vasopressor support and has had difficulty maintaining adequate blood pressure. There are concerns about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. This can be indicated by worsening respiratory symptoms, increased white blood cell count, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation. Signs of DVT may include unilateral leg swelling, pain, redness, and warmth in the affected leg.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk for developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid production. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and melena.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections."

   1. No son[**Name (NI) 330**] correlate corresponding to the hypoenhancing lesion
   seen on
   prior CT of [**2115-3-24**] is seen. Lesion seen on CT could represent an
   infarct
   secondary to compromised blood supply through the right portal vein,
   which
   appears nearly occluded.
   2. Right pleural effusion and ascites.
   Sputum growing MRSA ([**3-24**]) and rare gram negative rods ([**3-25**])
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to PSV
   will reduce PEEP from 8 to 5
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp but
   repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious nuchal
   rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE could
   cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen on
   CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR,
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - will check drug levels tomorrow
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].
   .

He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed respiratory failure, leading to intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-lobar pneumonia and started on antibiotics. He also has a fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient's condition is complicated by ascites, pleural effusions, and a liver lesion that may be an infarct or abscess. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving aggressive management for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of tachypnea and hypoxia resulted in the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to multi-lobar pneumonia and potential aspiration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status suggest ongoing infection and the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring and prompt management are essential.
3. Liver infarct/abscess: The liver lesion seen on imaging could represent either an infarct or an abscess. Further evaluation and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications such as liver failure or spread of infection.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and evidence of hemorrhage into the bowel"

   RUQ U/S:
   1. No son[**Name (NI) 330**] correlate corresponding to the hypoenhancing lesion
   seen on prior CT of [**2115-3-24**] is seen. Lesion seen on CT could
   represent an infarct secondary to compromised blood supply through the
   right portal vein, which appears nearly occluded.
   2. Right pleural effusion and ascites.
   Sputum growing MRSA ([**3-24**]) and rare gram negative rods ([**3-25**])
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier once
   extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to PSV
   will reduce PEEP from 8 to 5

   repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious nuchal
   rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE could
   cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen on

   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 but normal white count, lactate normal.

He is also being monitored for seizure disorder and cerebral palsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial admission to the ICU was due to respiratory failure, and he has continued to deteriorate with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The presence of multilobar pneumonia suggests a potential complication related to his respiratory system.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension meet the criteria for sepsis. The likely source of infection appears to be pulmonary, possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia. This could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old individual with cerebral palsy who has been admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia and continues to require ventilator support. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a maximum temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 126 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 85/63 to 101/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range at 99 mg/dL.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and cefepime. They are also receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions. Other medications include furosemide, pantoprazole, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lidocaine patch, ferrous sulfate, pancrealipase, and chlorhexidine.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, normal heart sounds, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, soft non-tender distended abdomen, and mild edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there is an elevation in creatinine levels,"

   Spoke with Mr. [**Known lastname 11934**]
s mother, father, and uncle.  Explained to them
   that Mr. [**Known lastname 11934**] has been very ill, in the hospital for 6 weeks.
   There is a significant chance that he will not be able to come off the
   vent, and will be reintubated after extubation.   In this case he would
   require tracheostomy and prolonged ventilator weaning.  Given his
   underlying illness with cerebral palsy his chances of returning to the
   quality of life that he had before this illness very poor, but not
   inconceivable.  Given this they might want to think about whether or
   not they would want a tracheostomy for him, with the knowledge that
   this would mean a prolonged ventilator wean at a rehab facility with
   uncertainty about his chances for recovery.  They said that they would
   think about it.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier once
   extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier
   once extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].

   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, A-line in right brachial artery

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). On admission, the patient was in critical condition with high fever, rapid heart rate, and low blood pressure. He required immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with fluctuating body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation levels. He is still on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 328 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's respiratory support parameters show an adequate respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 121 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 207.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.5 K/uL and a decreased hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, suggesting ongoing infection and blood loss. Other lab values reveal a slightly elevated blood glucose level, elevated lactate level, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The patient's medical history includes a seizure episode without status epilepticus, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and a fracture. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS, and is being managed in the ICU.

The patient is on full nutrition support through Vivonex and is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and is currently dispositioned in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The presence of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the blood cultures indicates a potential nosocomial infection.
3. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): The patient's unstable vital signs, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal laboratory values suggest a possibility of MODS.
4. Bleeding: The patient's acute anemia is secondary to blood loss, which could be due to hemorrhage or other causes.
5. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of suspected sepsis along with the ongoing infection markers raises concerns about the development of sepsis.
6. ARDS: Although the patient was initially suspected to have ARDS, the assessment notes that the respiratory failure is"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate. Ok to intubate or use pressors. No CPR or

   them that he is close to a trial of extubation, but there is a
   significant chance that he would not be able to protect airway and is
   at risk for reintubation.  In this case he would need a tracheostomy
   for continued vent weaning.  However given his prolonged illess (6
   weeks in hospital), and his chronic debilitation, his chances of
   recovery and getting home and back to his previous quality of life are
   at best poor.  Given this situation the family has elected to not
   reintubate if we extubate him.  If he fails, they will make him CMO and
   not choose further aggressive care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy who has been in the ICU for an extended period of time. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. 

The patient has been weaned off pressors and peep, and sedation has been discontinued. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/71 mmHg to 107/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on FiO2 40%. 

The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 324 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 207. 

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, non-tender and distended abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and has unassessed movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes.

   Assessment and Plan
35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - likely extubation tomorrow with optimization today
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 1000cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - f/u beta glucan, aspergillus galactomannan
   - consider D/C picc line
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   - change foley today, follow up on culture data
   .
   #Hypotension. Off Vasopressors. [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and
   currently sedated which may contribute. MAP goal > 60. No further
   episodes of AMS since starting pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old man with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and chronic pancreatitis. He was admitted with acute abdomen and peritonitis and found to have a superior mesenteric vein thrombus. The patient developed retroperitoneal hemorrhage and was readmitted with progressive hypoxemia, leading to intubation. A CT scan revealed a liver abscess, and imaging studies showed multilobar pneumonia with pleural effusions. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, respiratory deterioration, and sepsis, likely due to MRSA pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, necessitating intubation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to suspected MRSA pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration and organ failure if not appropriately managed.
3. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient has evidence of multilobar pneumonia with pleural effusions. There is a risk of worsening lung infection and potential complications such as abscess formation or empyema.
4. Liver abscess: The patient has a liver abscess, which could lead to complications like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or sepsis if not treated appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - f/u beta glucan, aspergillus galactomannan
   - consider D/C picc line
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate. Ok to intubate or use pressors. No CPR or

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 35-year-old man with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cysts, and a previous hospitalization for abdominal pain. He was admitted with acute abdomen and peritonitis, and found to have a superior mesenteric vein thrombus, which was treated with anticoagulation. However, he developed a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and was readmitted. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to progressive hypoxemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.6°F, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 91/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, and slight anemia. Imaging studies reveal multilobar pneumonia, pleural effusions, liver abscess, and evidence of depressed cardiac function.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia, daily respiratory system compliance and breathing trials as tolerated, gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses, close monitoring of electrolytes, and repletion while on lasix. Further evaluation includes repeat blood cultures, additional coverage for double gram-negative coverage if the white blood cell count does not continue trending down, and consideration of discontinuing the PICC line.

   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - f/u beta glucan, aspergillus galactomannan
   - consider D/C picc line
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst drainage, and a recent admission for abdominal pain. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, multilobar pneumonia, and possibly sepsis. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA and gram-negative coverage. He has been diuresed with Lasix boluses to achieve a negative fluid balance. The patient also has hypotension and tachycardia, which may be due to sepsis or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. There are concerns about anemia, liver lesions, a left humeral fracture, and a superior mesenteric vein thrombus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging given his deteriorating respiratory status and ongoing infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with his fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Continued monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction and potential septic shock is necessary.
3. Multilobar Pneumonia: The patient has imaging findings consistent with multilobar pneumonia. Adequate antibiotic coverage should be maintained, and further imaging or diagnostic tests may be needed to monitor treatment response.
4. Hypotension/Tachycardia:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with cerebral palsy who has recurrent respiratory failure due to pneumonia and volume overload. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient successfully completed a 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning with a Respiratory Support Assessment Score (RSBI) of 93. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83-61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has been receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole since March 30th, and pantoprazole (Protonix) since the same day. The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count at 189 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologically, the patient is attentive but unable to follow simple commands.

The assessment and plan include seizure without status epilepticus, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fracture other, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). The healthcare team has"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - discontinue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole as patient has completed total 8 days (Day 1 =
   [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - optimize for extubation
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pancreatic cyst drainage in 2013, and currently admitted for abdominal pain. The patient's condition has been complicated, leading to new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. He was intubated on March 24th and transferred to the MICU. Imaging findings showed multilobar pneumonia, and he was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. Sputum culture grew MRSA, and pleural effusions were noted, likely due to fluid resuscitation. The patient has been diuresed with lasix boluses. A CT angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: Continue daily respiratory system assessment and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) as tolerated. Consider extubation today.
2. Fever/sepsis: Continue broad antibiotic coverage with good gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic coverage. Monitor blood cultures and ABGs.
3. Hypotension: Goal central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12, maintain urine output (UOP) less than 30cc/h, goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60, cardiac output (CvO2) greater than 70. Bolus fluids for t"

   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes overnight may be
   secondary to aggressive diuresis.
   - discontinue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole as patient has completed total 8 days (Day 1 =
   [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - optimize for extubation
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Today is last day of 8-day course.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a past medical history of cirrhosis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst who was admitted with abdominal pain. He developed respiratory failure and was intubated on [**2115-3-24**]. He has been treated with antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia due to recent tube feeding. Imaging findings show multilobar pneumonia and pleural effusions. His blood cultures grew MRSA. He has had fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia, meeting the definition of sepsis with likely pulmonary source. Other possible sources of infection include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and urinary tract infection (UTI), but these have been ruled out. He has been febrile daily despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. His condition is complicated by hypotension, tachycardia, anemia, liver lesion, left humeral fracture, superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombus, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent respiratory deterioration indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. He was already intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to tachypnea and hypoxia.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypoxia, and positive blood cultures for MRSA suggest ongoing sepsis. Despite"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with cerebral palsy who has been experiencing recurrent respiratory failure due to pneumonia and volume overload. He is currently in the ICU and is doing well this morning on spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), able to maintain negative airway pressure overnight. The plan is to attempt extubation this morning.

The patient has a history of seizures, alterations in nutrition, tachycardia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and fractures. He also has acute respiratory failure that is not attributed to ARDS.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72/44 mmHg to 151/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 369 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 109.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 7.1 to 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 28.5% to 30.4%, platelet (Plt) count of 150,000/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 85 to 150 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

Imaging shows improved but not resolved bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if extubation is unsuccessful or if the patient develops new complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, which may be related to his cerebral palsy or other underlying neurological conditions. Seizures can recur if the underlying cause is not adequately managed.

3. Infection: The patient has low-grade fevers, and his CXR shows bilateral infiltrates. This could indicate an ongoing infection, such as pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further evaluation for infection should be done.

4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Close monitoring of blood counts and appropriate transfusion should be considered to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

5. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload. Careful management of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent further fluid overload and associated complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.

6. Nutritional Issues: The patient has alterations in nutrition, which may be contributing to his overall poor condition. Nutritional support"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes two nights ago may
   be secondary to aggressive diuresis.  Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The
   current respiratory distress is likely due to mucous plugging,
   secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam. Pulmonary edema may
   also be contributing.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - suction and light chest PT
   - consider gentle diuresis although difficult given low BP
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Off Abx as above.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst, and a recent admission for abdominal pain. He was transferred to the MICU due to respiratory failure and intubated on [**2115-3-24**]. The patient developed a fever, respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with multilobar pneumonia, leading to the initiation of vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds). Sputum grew MRSA. Pleural effusions were also noted on imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of an albumin level of 2.3, so over the past 24 hours, they have been diuresing with lasix boluses. A CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism. The patient experienced apneic episodes two nights ago, which may be secondary to aggressive diuresis. He was extubated on [**2115-3-30**]. The current respiratory distress is likely due to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam. Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. Despite being extubated, he continues to experience respiratory distress, which could lead to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Extubated in the morning with a plan to avoid reintubation.
2. Experienced coughing and desaturation to upper 80s post-extubation, along with fever. Received a dose of IV lasix, which appeared to help.
3. Tube feeding (TF) was withheld due to the risk of aspiration.
4. Experienced hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 70s in the afternoon after diuresing around 800 cc with Lasix. No intervention was required, and blood pressures improved to the 90s.
5. Overnight, while sleeping, mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped to 55 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) fell below 70. A 250 cc bolus was administered.
6. The patient has a history of fever, seizure, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fracture, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).
7. The patient is currently receiving nutrition via Vivonex at 50 mL/hour and has multiple lines, including a PICC line and arterial line.
8. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the history of acute respiratory failure, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory distress or pneumonia.
2. Infection: The persistent fever and recent cultures suggest a possible ongoing infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The episodes of hypotension and low MAP indicate potential hemodynamic instability, which could be attributed to sepsis or fluid imbalances.
4. Aspiration: With TF held and the risk of aspiration, there is a possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
5. Thromboembolic events: Given the immobilization and presence of multiple risk factors, there is an increased risk of developing DVT or pulmonary embolism.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, maintain adequate fluid balance, investigate the source of infection, and provide appropriate prophylaxis to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes two nights ago may
   be secondary to aggressive diuresis.  Extubated yesterday; has had a
   few low O2 sats.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Off Abx as above.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.
   Will clarify role for BIPAP/CPAP.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and pancreatic cyst that was drained in [**2113**]. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and later developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient has had a complicated course, including new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Imaging findings are consistent with multilobar pneumonia, and the patient was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole due to concerns for aspiration given recently started tube feeds. Sputum cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Pleural effusions were also noted on imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension.

The patient has been diuresing with Lasix boluses and has experienced hypotension with MAPs in the 70s. The patient's blood pressure improved to the 90s after giving a 250cc bolus. Overnight, the patient experienced a drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 55 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) to <70, so a 250cc bolus was given.

The patient's recent labs show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.7, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.4, platelet count (Plt) of 37,000, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6, blood glucose of 118, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.49.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with tachypnea and hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**]. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for MRSA pneumonia. The patient's sputum culture is negative. The patient is expected to continue with daily respiratory system baseline assessment (RSBI) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) as tolerated and will likely be extubated today.

2. Fever/sepsis: The patient remains febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea, meeting the definition of sepsis with the most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA). The patient's blood cultures are negative. SBP is also possible, although the patient has already undergone three taps without finding any signs of SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] showed staph spp., but the repeat culture appears clean with no growth of nitrate-reducing gram-negative bacteria (NGTD).

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes two nights ago may
   be secondary to aggressive diuresis.  Extubated yesterday; has had a
   few low O2 sats.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Off Abx as above.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.
   Will clarify role for BIPAP/CPAP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst, and previous hospitalization for abdominal pain. He was admitted with respiratory failure and intubated on day 2. The patient developed a fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, leading to the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole) due to suspected pneumonia and concern for aspiration. His sputum grew MRSA, and pleural effusions were noted on imaging. The patient has been diuresing with Lasix boluses due to fluid overload. He was extubated yesterday but experienced low O2 sats. The patient is still febrile and tachycardic. He has a history of ascites with three prior paracenteses without detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Urinalysis and culture showed staph spp but repeated tests were clean with no growth of nitrate-reducing bacteria. A possible liver abscess was seen on CT scan, but it was read as more consistent with infarction. Clostridium difficile was negative. The patient continues to have fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia despite being off antibiotics. The assessment includes respiratory failure, fever/sepsis, hypotension, tachycardia, anemia/bleed, liver lesion,"

- The patient was previously intubated but was extubated yesterday.
- The patient required further diuresis due to ongoing hypoxemia, with an improvement of 250cc. However, the patient received a 250cc bolus overnight because of low mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the 50s.
- The patient has been on invasive ventilation and is currently using accessory muscles to breathe. The patient still requires a large amount of oxygen.
- The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, despite completing an antibiotic course.
- The patient's review of systems shows tachycardia, tachypnea, and minimal pain.
- The patient's physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, and warm skin.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 132 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/83 to 97/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes two nights ago may
   be secondary to aggressive diuresis.  Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The
   current respiratory distress is likely due to mucous plugging,
   secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam. Pulmonary edema may
   also be contributing.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - suction and light chest PT
   - consider gentle diuresis although difficult given low BP
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Off Abx as above.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.
   Will clarify role for BIPAP/CPAP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst, and a recent episode of respiratory failure. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed a complicated course, including fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient was transferred to the MICU and intubated due to respiratory distress. Imaging findings consistent with multilobar pneumonia were observed, leading to the initiation of vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds). Sputum cultures grew MRSA. Pleural effusions were also noted on imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation. The patient has been diuresed with Lasix boluses. A CT angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism. The patient was extubated on 3/30 but subsequently developed respiratory distress, likely due to mucous plugging and secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on examination. Pulmonary edema may also be contributing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory distress could lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the definition of sepsis with fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, likely originating from a pulmonary source (MRSA pneumonia). 
3. Hypotension:"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for sepsis secondary to pneumonia with acute kidney injury. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 83/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula with face tent. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been started on fluconazole 6mg/kg for a yeast infection, which was identified in both the blood culture (3-31) and urine culture (3-29). The Foley catheter has been changed, and daily blood cultures are being obtained. The PICC line will need to be pulled due to difficulty flushing and drawing labs. An echo and ophthalmology consult may be required.

The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics including metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime. The last dose of fluconazole was administered at 01:56 AM on 4/2.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 2616 mL and output of 1937 mL over the past 24 hours. The heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Respiratory support is being provided through a nasal cannula and"

   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to goal -500cc
   - change pantoprazole from IV to PO to limit amount of IVF
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - daily blood cultures
   - TTE
   - pull picc line and arterial line pending obtainment of new central
   access

   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to goal -500cc
   - change pantoprazole from IV to PO to limit amount of IVF
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - daily blood cultures
   - TTE
   - pull PICC line and attempt peripheral access or if unable central
   line for temporary access
   - start fluconazole 200 IV (6mg/kg)
   - foley catheter changed overnight
   - ophthalmologic evaluation
   - check LFT, EKG
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - change pantoprazole to PO
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   .
   FEN: continue tube feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PO PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.
   Will clarify role for BIPAP/CPAP.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst that was drained in 2013, and currently admitted with abdominal pain. The patient has had a complicated course, including fever, hypoxemia, and blood culture growing yeast.

The patient was intubated on 3/24 due to tachypnea and hypoxia and extubated on 3/30. He is currently experiencing respiratory distress likely due to mucous plugging and secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam. Pulmonary edema may also be contributing. The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (116 bpm), low blood pressure (83/63 mmHg), and increased respiratory rate (39 breaths per minute).

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, normal platelet count of 189 K/uL, and normal creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. The blood cultures have grown yeast, indicating a possible yeast bacteremia. The patient's urine culture also shows a significant growth of yeast.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemia, yeast bacteremia, and fever. The plan is to continue antimicrobial agents, including fluconazole for yeast infection, suction and light chest"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has been transferred to the MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia. Despite completing an 8-day course of antibiotics, the patient still exhibits respiratory distress likely due to mucous plugging and secretions. Pulmonary edema may also be contributing to the hypoxemia.

2. Yeast bacteremia: The patient has positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast, indicating a yeast bloodstream infection. This could be due to a urogenital source with hematogenous spread.

3. Fever: The patient continues to have fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Possible sources include systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, or other infections such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff), which has been negative in this case.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an increased heart rate, likely hyperdynamic in the setting of fever and infection. Volume status appears euvolemic, but there may be evidence of depressed cardiac function, potentially tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

5. Anemia/bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and has received a blood transfusion. There is a need to monitor hemoglobin levels and watch for any signs of bleeding.

6. Liver lesion: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy, recurrent aspiration, and prolonged oxygen requirement. He has a history of respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 87/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on several medications including metronidazole, vancomycin, cefepime, fluconazole, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, furosemide, and others. 

The patient's recent changes include the administration of fluconazole for yeast bacteremia from a PIC line, which will need to be removed. The patient also has a seizure disorder and is being evaluated for further management. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, and amylase levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/hypoxemia: The patient still shows signs of pulmonary edema and poor secretion clearance, indicating a continued risk of respiratory failure.
2. Yeast infection: The presence of yeast bacteremia from the PIC line suggests a risk of systemic fungal infection, requiring appropriate antifungal treatment and removal of the central line.
3. Seizure disorder: The"

   IMPRESSION: Moderately thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets
   with moderate to severe stenosis. At least moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Small echodensity in the left atrium adjacent to the
   anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) which appears consistent
   with artifact from mitral annular and valvular calcification; however,
   a small vegetation cannot be excluded. Mild global biventricular
   hypokinesis.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-3-25**], the
   findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.

   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to go even to
   -500cc negative
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - daily blood cultures

   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pancreatic cyst drainage, and a recent admission for abdominal pain with complications. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress and yeast bacteremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has been transferred to the MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia, and later intubated. They have completed a course of antibiotics for multilobar pneumonia but continue to experience respiratory distress, possibly due to mucous plugging and secretions. Pulmonary edema may also be contributing to their respiratory issues.

2. Yeast Bacteremia: The patient has positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast, indicating a yeast bloodstream infection. This could lead to further systemic complications if not appropriately treated.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be due to hyperdynamic state in the setting of fever and infection. There is also evidence of depressed cardiac function on the echocardiogram, raising the possibility of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

4. Anemia/Bleed: Although the patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable, they have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and evidence of hemorrhage into the bowel wall. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and appropriate management of potential bleeding episodes are necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pancreatic cyst that was drained in 2013, and recent respiratory distress due to mucous plugging and secretions. The patient has been admitted multiple times with various complications such as multilobar pneumonia, pleural effusions, yeast bacteremia, liver lesion, left humeral fracture, and SMV thrombus.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory distress and mucous plugging can lead to inadequate oxygenation of the blood.

2. Yeast bloodstream infection: The patient has positive blood cultures growing yeast, indicating a possible yeast bloodstream infection. This requires prompt treatment with appropriate antifungal medications.

3. Cardiac dysfunction: The echocardiogram showed moderately thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets with moderate to severe stenosis, at least moderate mitral regurgitation, and small echodensity in the left atrium adjacent to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. These findings suggest potential cardiac dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by the presence of a yeast bloodstream infection.

4. Liver lesion: The patient has a liver lesion that could potentially be an abscess or ischemia/infarction. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.

   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to go even to
   -500cc negative
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve

   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,

   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst, and previous drainage. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and developed a complicated course, including fever, hypoxemia, and blood culture growing yeast. The patient has been in the ICU and received various treatments for infections, including MRSA pneumonia and yeast bacteremia. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress due to mucous plugging and secretions, and pulmonary edema may also be contributing. There are concerns about potential complications such as hypoxemia, yeast bacteremia, fevers, tachycardia, anemia/bleed, liver lesion, left humeral fracture, SMV thrombus, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may require continued respiratory support and further evaluation of the respiratory system.
2. Yeast Bacteremia: The presence of yeast in the blood cultures indicates a systemic fungal infection that requires ongoing antifungal treatment and monitoring for any signs of dissemination.
3. Fevers: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers, suggesting an ongoing infection or other underlying cause that needs to be identified and treated.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be due to hyperdynamic state caused by fever and infection, but further evaluation is needed to rule out other causes such as t"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy who is experiencing respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. He has had a peritoneal dialysis catheter placed and has undergone several procedures, including arterial line insertion, paracentesis, and trans thoracic echo. The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is on medication for it. He is currently receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antibiotics for suspected fungal infection. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure, indicating potential cardiovascular compromise. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and face tent. The patient's ABG results show respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases of the lungs. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with neutrophilia, elevated creatinine, and low albumin levels. He also has elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrolyte levels. Fluid analysis of peritoneal fluid shows an increased white blood cell count with neutrophils.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged respiratory failure leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Sepsis due to fungal infection or aspiration pneumonia.
4. Cardiac tamponade or other cardiac complications.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension or sepsis.
6. Malnutrition and poor nutritional status.
7. Deep vein thrombosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT as tolerated
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV for TBB -500ml today
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress as needed
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have low grade fevers, now
   with positive blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital source
   with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure currently at
   baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - lines removed and replaced
   - daily blood cultures
   - follow speciation and sensitivity
   - continue micafungin IV per ID day 1 = [**4-2**]
   - f/u ID recs
   - follow LFT, EKG while on micafungin
   - f/u PICC tip culture
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast. Repeat cultures of
   blood, urine ngtd.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct qd
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - PO pantoprazole
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin, but transition to PO route
   - Drug levels wnl on [**4-3**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   - speech and swallow evaluation: advance diet
   .
   # Case Management
 likely d/c to rehab tomorrow.
   .
   FEN: continue tube feeds today; cleared for nectar thick liquids,
   pureed solids; needs 1:1 observation (mother may need to feed). OK to
   try crushed meds, but may not take reliably
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PO PPI, restart SC heparin
   ACCESS: PIV
   CODE: DNR/DNI. No CPR or defibrillation. Will clarify role for
   BIPAP/CPAP.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst post drainage in 2013, admitted with abdominal pain, complicated course now with fever, hypoxemia, and blood culture growing yeast. The patient was transferred to the MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia on 03/23/2015, intubated on 03/24/2015, and extubated on 03/30/2015. He has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA. Pleural effusions were also noted on imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of an albumin level of 2.3, so he has been diuresed with Lasix boluses. 

The patient currently has low-grade fevers, positive blood cultures growing yeast, and is being treated with micafungin IV. He has rhonchi on lung auscultation, suggesting possible mucous plugging, and may have pulmonary edema contributing to his respiratory distress. 

He has a history of anemia and bleeding, with a stable hematocrit level. The patient has been transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on 03/25/2015 and has remained stable since. 

There is a liver lesion noted on abdominal"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT as tolerated
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to go even as
   patient appears slightly dry on exam
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress as needed
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have low grade fevers, now
   with positive blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital source
   with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure currently at
   baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - lines removed and replaced
   - daily blood cultures
   - follow speciation and sensitivity
   - continue micafungin IV per ID day 1 = [**4-2**]
   - f/u ID recs
   - follow LFT, EKG
   - f/u PICC tip culture
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast. Repeat cultures of
   blood, urine ngtd.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct qd
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - PO pantoprazole
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ???
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin, but transition to PO route
   - Drug levels wnl on [**4-3**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   - speech and swallow evaluation: advance diet
   .
   FEN: continue tube feeds today; cleared for nectar thick liquids,
   pureed solids; needs 1:1 observation (mother may need to feed). OK to
   try crushed meds, but may not take reliably
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PO PPI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cysts, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed fever, hypoxemia, and blood culture growing yeast. The patient has been treated for multilobar pneumonia with MRSA, completed an 8-day course of vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. He was extubated on [**2115-3-30**] and currently has respiratory distress likely due to mucous plugging and pulmonary edema. The patient has a positive blood culture growing yeast, possible urogenital source with hematogenous spread. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and suctioning as tolerated are recommended.

2. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture growing yeast, suggesting a yeast bloodstream infection. Treatment with micafungin IV is ongoing, and follow-up blood cultures are necessary.

3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's echocardiogram showed evidence of depressed cardiac function, possibly tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is essential, and further evaluation may be required.

4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and received a blood transfusion. Regular monitoring of hemodynamic status and coagulation parameters"
