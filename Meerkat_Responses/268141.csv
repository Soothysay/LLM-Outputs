","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [Hospital1] with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a fever, and there is a suspicion of an abdominal source given the presence of Klebsiella and Enterococcus from a hematoma at his surgical wound site. The patient's respiratory rate has been elevated overnight, and he is on mechanical ventilation. Other medical issues include head bobbing, elevated liver function tests, acute renal failure, constipation, and a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD) and aortic regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected Mesh: There is a concern for an infected mesh due to the presence of Klebsiella and Enterococcus. The patient's fever may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Infected Hematoma: The patient may have an infected hematoma, which could be contributing to the fever and systemic infection.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by his elevated respiratory rate, need for mechanical ventilation, and primary respiratory alkalosis on ABG.
4. Seizure Activity: The patient's head bobbing could be indicative of seizure activity, and further evaluation with EEG and head CT is recommended.
5. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [Hospital1] with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/76 to 137/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and not responsive to verbal stimuli.

The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, nasogastric tube (NGT) that is satisfactory, and multiple drains in the abdomen. The drains are draining biliary fluid and green fluid, which may indicate leakage or fistula formation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), total bilirubin (T Bili), lactate, and lactic acid levels. The patient also has low albumin and elevated levels of PT/INR.

Radiology reports include a chest X-ray showing tracheostomy termination above the carina and an NGT terminating below the diaphragm. There is also bibasilar atelectasis present. A CT torso with PO"

   LIVER U/S:
   1. Patent hepatic vasculature.
   2. 2.5 x 2.3 x 3.0 cm heterogeneous lesion within the left lobe of the
   liver,
   incompletely characterized, recommend contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT
   or MRI
   for further delineation.
   3. Known midline collection with drainage tube, partially imaged, as
   more
   fully characterized on concurrent CT examination.
   4. Coarsened echotexture of the liver, compatible with known cirrhosis.
   CT ABDOMEN:
   1. Contrast is tracking from bowel loops to the anterior abdominal wall
   in
   the lower right lower quadrant area. The findings are concerning for
   enterocutaneous fistula.
   2. Status post multiple upper GI surgeries including Roux-en-Y
   gastrojejunostomy . No obstruction or leak is noted.
   3. The previously noted fluid collection within the anterior abdominal
   wall
   has significantly improved.
   4. 4.5 cm focus of hyperdense fluid collection adjacent to the
   acetabulum on
   the left side which may be related to the left total hip replacement
   and
   protrusio acetabulum.
   CT HEAD: No acute intracranial process.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever: Likely abdominal source given Klebsiella, Enterococcus from a
   hematoma at his surgical wound site.  Concern for infected mesh +/-
   hematoma.
   - Trend temp curve, WBC
   - Send blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, biliary cx, 3 JPs
   cx
   - f/u culture data from all drain sites
   - Continue GNB coverage with IV Abx, Vanc and Zosyn
   - Micafungin for yeast
   - Surgery team consult (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; f/u any recommendations (will
   discuss cholangigram, feeding)
   - ID consult in AM
   - Resite lines (obtain peripherals, pulled PICC)
   - TTE today for ? endocarditis
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 100 cc/hr (may need increased rate if slow to correct)
   - Q6H Na levels
   .
   # Nutrition:
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will discuss further with surgery
   and IR re: placement of G-J tube or line through duodenal drain
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started yesterday per daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
   history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic activity
   over night.
   - EEG
   - head CT
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed.
   .
   # Constipation: stool seen on OSH CT scan, no BM in several days
   - repeat erythromycin, protonix, reglan as CT scan did not show
   evidence of obstruction
   - ? bowel regimen
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient tachypneic overnight
   with RR 30s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

   LIVER U/S:
   1. Patent hepatic vasculature.
   2. 2.5 x 2.3 x 3.0 cm heterogeneous lesion within the left lobe of the
   liver,
   incompletely characterized, recommend contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT
   or MRI
   for further delineation.
   3. Known midline collection with drainage tube, partially imaged, as
   more
   fully characterized on concurrent CT examination.
   4. Coarsened echotexture of the liver, compatible with known cirrhosis.
   CT ABDOMEN:
   1. Contrast is tracking from bowel loops to the anterior abdominal wall
   in
   the lower right lower quadrant area. The findings are concerning for
   enterocutaneous fistula.
   2. Status post multiple upper GI surgeries including Roux-en-Y
   gastrojejunostomy . No obstruction or leak is noted.
   3. The previously noted fluid collection within the anterior abdominal
   wall
   has significantly improved.
   4. 4.5 cm focus of hyperdense fluid collection adjacent to the
   acetabulum on
   the left side which may be related to the left total hip replacement
   and
   protrusio acetabulum.
   CT HEAD: No acute intracranial process.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple surgical interventions who is being transferred to another hospital. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infected mesh and hematoma: The patient has a concern for infected mesh and hematoma at the surgical wound site. This is indicated by the presence of fever and Klebsiella and Enterococcus bacteria from a hematoma at his surgical wound site. Trend temperature curve, white blood cell count, and sending blood cultures are recommended to further evaluate this condition.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has had an episode of respiratory alkalosis overnight. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjustment of ventilator settings as needed are advised.

3. Seizure activity: The patient is experiencing head bobbing, which may be indicative of seizure activity. An EEG and head CT are recommended to investigate further.

4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated ALT and AST levels. This could be due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection. Trending the LFTs and considering other causes for the elevation are necessary.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline. Prerenal causes are suspected, and the patient received a fluid bolus with normal saline, resulting in a decrease in creatinine and sodium levels. Continued IV fluid boluses as needed and monitoring kidney"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The chief complaint is polymicrobial sepsis presumed secondary to intraabdominal pathology. The patient has a fever of 100.9 degrees Celsius and mult + peritoneal fluid culture. They have been unresponsive and unable to provide their own medical history.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 83-103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 148/80 to 168/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O. Their arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.52, PaCO2 of 24 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 440.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight, and obese appearance. They have clear breath sounds and warm skin, but exhibit right and left lower extremity edema. Neurologically, the patient is unattentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to noxious stimuli, shows no spontaneous movement, and has not assessed muscle tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count of 317 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 95-125 mg/dL,"

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a critically ill individual with polymicrobial sepsis presumed to be secondary to an intra-abdominal source. The patient is unable to provide a history due to being unresponsive. Allergies include iodine and iodine-containing substances, leading to anaphylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F) and a current temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F). The patient's heart rate is within normal range at 83 beats per minute, blood pressure varies between 148/80 mmHg and 141/71 mmHg, respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an input of 1,000 mL and output of 3,126 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,126 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O, compliance of 31.3 cmH2O/mL, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.52, PaCO2 of 24 mmHg, HCO3- of 176 mEq/L, SaO2 of 100%, Ve of 7.6 L/min, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 440.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished and overweight-obese appearance, normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, clear breath sounds, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and no spontaneous movement with normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count of 317 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, low platelet count of 115 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, decreased albumin level of 2.2 g/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 585/416). Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has multiple medical complications including polymicrobial sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, wound infection, hypernatremia, and obstructive liver function tests. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, development of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, worsening sepsis, and potential need for additional surgeries to address intra-abdominal sources of infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever: Likely abdominal source given Klebsiella, Enterococcus from a
   hematoma at his surgical wound site.  Concern for infected mesh +/-
   hematoma.
   - Trend temp curve, WBC
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, biliary cx, 3 JPs
   cx
   - f/u culture data from all drain sites
   - Continue GNB coverage with IV Abx, Vanc and meropenem
   - Micafungin for yeast
   - Surgery team consult (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; f/u any recommendations (will
   discuss cholangigram, feeding)
   - f/u ID consult recs
   - Resite lines (obtain peripherals, pulled PICC)
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 100 cc/hr; corrected rapidly to 143 and then discontinued
   D5W.  Repeat 148.  Will restart D5W and monitor closely.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB today showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 IR may be able to place distal
   feeding tube, likely beyond possible enterocutaneous fistula.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started yesterday per daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
   history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic activity
   over night.
   - f/u EEG
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.  Now stable at 1.6.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # Constipation/GIB: stool seen on OSH CT scan, now having melena
   - GI and surgery both aware of new melena.
   - likely no intervention at this time, trend HCT q 8 for now and then
   space to [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient tachypneic overnight
   with RR 30s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is now being transferred to another hospital with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition includes fever, hypernatremia, head bobbing, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), acute renal failure (ARF), constipation/gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), respiratory failure, and a history of cardiac arrest. 

The assessment and plan include:

1. Fever: Trend temperature curve, WBC, and follow-up blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, biliary culture, and 3 JPs culture. Continue GNB coverage with IV antibiotics (Vanc and meropenem) and micafungin for yeast. Consult surgery team and discuss cholangiogram and feeding options.

2. Hypernatremia: Restart D5W at 100 cc/hr and monitor closely. Continue Q6H sodium levels.

3. Nutrition: Optimal enteral feeding is desired, but currently not receiving due to lack of dedicated line. IR may be able to place a distal feeding tube.

4. Head Bobbing: Follow-up EEG and consider seizure prophylaxis.

5. Elevated LFTs: Trend and consider possible causes such as hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.

6. ARF: Continue IVF boluses as needed and monitor UOP and renal function closely.

","Summary of Information:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of multiple surgical interventions.
- He is currently in the ICU for concern of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, with a trend temperature curve, WBC count, and culture data from various sites.
- He has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a history of seizures, and an EEG has been ordered.
- His electrolytes are relatively stable, but he has hypernatremia, which was corrected but then re-elevated.
- He has melena and elevated liver function tests (LFTs), possibly due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis and liver disease, and a liver mass was noted on ultrasound.
- He has altered mental status and is not following commands, with an EEG underway to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).
- The patient has a wound infection and is being followed by surgery.
- He is receiving IV antibiotics, antifungals, and has a prophylactic heparin infusion.
- The patient's lines have been changed.
- His respiratory support has been adjusted, with CPAP mode and a decreased PEEP.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial sepsis: The patient is presumed to have polymicrobial sepsis due to an intra-abdominal source. The presence of multiple organisms in the blood cultures suggests a severe infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to have respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of respiratory alkalosis on the ABG.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is not following commands. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, liver disease, or nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not corrected properly.
5. Wound infection: The patient has a wound infection that requires surgical intervention.
6. Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass noted on ultrasound, which may be concerning for hepatoma given his history of hepatitis C infection. Further imaging and evaluation are needed.
7. Constipation/gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is experiencing melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be related to his altered mental status or the presence of an abscess/collection.
8. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal failure, possibly due to hypoperfusion or the effects of sepsis.

Please note that the potential complications listed are based on the provided information and may not be an exhaustive list."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast
    - plan for line holiday, blood cultures negative to date
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u stool studies
   - check CMV VL per ID rec given multiple blood transfusions
   - plan for T tube cholangiogram given elevated LFT
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 100 cc/hr; corrected rapidly to 143 and then discontinued
   D5W.  Repeat 148.  Will restart D5W and monitor closely.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   #Melana:  Patient with 2 episodes of melana overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - check AFP
   - consider further imaging to further characterize
   # Nutrition: KUB today showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient tachypneic overnight
   with RR 30s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started yesterday per daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
   history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic activity
   over night.
   - f/u EEG
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   - T tube cholangiogram to further evaluate
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.  Now stable at 1.6.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # Constipation/GIB: stool seen on OSH CT scan, now having melena
   - GI and surgery both aware of new melena.
   - likely no intervention at this time, trend HCT q 8 for now and then
   space to [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at another hospital and is now being transferred to our facility with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure.
- The patient has a fever, likely due to an intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in the peritoneal fluid. There is also a concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, and hematoma.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which was corrected rapidly to 143 and then discontinued. Repeat sodium level is 148, so D5W will be restarted and monitored closely.
- The patient had two episodes of melana overnight but remained hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit (HCT) level.
- There is a liver mass, and further imaging is needed to further characterize it. An alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test has been ordered.
- The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with tachypnea and ABG showing primary respiratory alkalosis. The patient is currently on volume assist control ventilation.
- The patient exhibits head bobbing, which may indicate seizure activity. An EEG has been ordered.
- Liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, possibly due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection. A T-tube cholangiogram has been planned to evaluate further.
- The patient reached a peak creatinine level"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   for > 24 hours.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u stool studies
   - check CMV VL per ID rec given multiple blood transfusions
   - plan for T tube cholangiogram given elevated LFT; patient will need
   to be pre-medicated with solumedrol/Benadryl d/t previous anaphylactic
   reaction (reportedly VF arrest 13 years ago)
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 250 cc/hr; corrected to 145.  Will continue D5W for a
   liter.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   # Nutrition: KUB yesterday showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Nutrition consult for TPN recommendations pending enteral feeding
   tube placement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient with respiratory rate
   20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   - T tube cholangiogram to further evaluate
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is now being transferred to another hospital with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Fever: The patient initially had a fever, most likely due to an intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods. However, he has been afebrile for over 24 hours. There is concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, and hematoma. Further evaluation and monitoring are recommended.

2. C. difficile positive: The patient is positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff), which may contribute to his symptoms. Treatment with metronidazole has been initiated.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, with a corrected sodium level of 145. He is receiving D5W at 250 cc/hr and will continue with D5W for a liter. Regular monitoring of sodium levels is advised.

4. Melena: The patient had two episodes of melena overnight, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. He remains hemodynamically stable, and his hematocrit (HCT) is stable as well. Close monitoring of HCT and further gastrointestinal recommendations are needed. Transfusion may be considered for HCT <25 or active bleeding.

5. Liver mass: An abdominal imaging revealed a liver mass, but the patient's alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level is"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   for > 24 hours.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u stool studies
   - check CMV VL per ID rec given multiple blood transfusions
   - plan for T tube cholangiogram given elevated LFT; patient will need
   to be pre-medicated with solumedrol/Benadryl d/t previous anaphylactic
   reaction (reportedly VF arrest 13 years ago)
   - Contact OSH in [**State 503**] for speciation of their yeast cx
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient with respiratory rate
   20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control; tolerating trach collar
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 250 cc/hr; corrected to 145.  Will continue D5W for a
   liter.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   # Nutrition: KUB yesterday showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Nutrition consult for TPN recommendations pending enteral feeding
   tube placement.
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   - T tube cholangiogram to further evaluate
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is now being transferred to another hospital with concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition includes fever, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and ventilation support, hypernatremia, melena (two episodes overnight), liver mass with normal AFP levels, and elevated liver function tests. The patient also has a history of seizures, possible acute renal failure, coronary artery disease, aortic regurgitation, hyperglycemia, and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Infection: The patient has signs of potential infections, including fever and positive cultures for gram-negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) in the peritoneal fluid. There is also concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, and hematoma. Additionally, the patient is c. difficile positive.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support through a tracheostomy tube and has respiratory alkalosis as shown in the ABG results. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory settings will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being corrected with D5W. Close monitoring of sodium levels and fluid balance is"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   for > 24 hours.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u stool studies
   - check CMV VL per ID rec given multiple blood transfusions
   - plan for T tube cholangiogram given elevated LFT; patient will need
   to be pre-medicated with solumedrol/Benadryl d/t previous anaphylactic
   reaction (reportedly VF arrest 13 years ago)
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 250 cc/hr; corrected to 145.  Will continue D5W for a
   liter.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   # Nutrition: KUB yesterday showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient with respiratory rate
   20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   - T tube cholangiogram to further evaluate
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.  Now stable at 1.6.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # Constipation/GIB: stool seen on OSH CT scan, now having melena
   - GI and surgery both aware of new melena.
   - likely no intervention at this time, trend HCT q 8 for now and then
   space to [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions and is now being transferred to a different hospital due to concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of fever, which is likely due to an intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods. He also has a positive c. difficile test. The patient has been afebrile for over 24 hours and is currently on antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 151/75 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's abdomen is soft, and he has multiple drains in place including a colostomy, biliary drain, and three Jackson-Pratt drains.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated lactate levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits, but he is hyperglycemic. The patient has a history of seizures, but no recent seizure activity has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of ERCP laceration of the gastric artery, complicated surgery, recurrent bowel infections, tracheostomy, and transfer to the ICU. He has been diagnosed with E. coli and yeast infections from the JP drains, HCV cirrhosis, and a liver lesion suspected to be hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal medication, and receiving IV fluids. He has hypernatremia and is being treated with D5W. The patient is also experiencing melena, or maroon stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy collar and is showing signs of respiratory failure. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low albumin levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay. This could be due to the presence of yeast and E. coli in the JP drains, as well as his HCV cirrhosis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of melena or maroon stools suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver damage. With his history of HCV cirrhosis and suspected HCC, there is a risk of progression to"

   [**2123-5-17**]
   - OSH culture data showing yeast in abdominal fluid from [**5-6**] and [**5-7**]:
   cultures growing C. albicans (no sensitivities)
   - Nutrition recs: check chem 10 qd, check TG (513), Goal TPN provide
   Trig and BS WNL will be 1.8L(320g dextrose/95g protein/45g fat) to
   provide 1918kcal; tube feed once small bowel feeding tube if placed,
   start with Vivonex TEN at 10ml/hr, monitor tolerance; continue SSI
   - ID recs: continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]; continue IV flagyl for C. Diff; continue
   micafungin pending final yeast cultures; follow-up CMV VL; repeat Bl cx
   if spikes
   - Surgery recs: plan for G-tube duodenostomy with small bowel
   follow-through study today to confirm position of T-tube and rule out
   leaks/obstruction
   - GI recs: may need scope for GIB but will hold off for now
   - Went for G-tube/duodenal tube barium study as above showing leak in
   duodenal tube, no barium processing through stomach. Then vomited up
   barium, had blood in JP drain, and melena at 9pm. F/u KUB ordered (no
   read yet but looks like majority of barium in stomach with little
   progression after ~4 hours). Surgery was consulted over these findings
   but nothing to do at this time. Hct stable at 28.
   - Hypernatremia: improved to 142 by PM labs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [Hospital1] due to concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient's current medical conditions include fever, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, melena, liver mass, CMV positivity, head bobbing (possibly seizure activity), elevated liver function tests (LFTs), acute renal failure (ARF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and aortic regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of fever and positive cultures for gram-negative rods, indicating a possible intra-abdominal infection. There is also a concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, and hematoma. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the infection may require further management.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation support. Weaning off ventilatory support may be challenging due to ongoing respiratory failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient had resolved hypernatremia but requires ongoing monitoring with labs.
4. Melena: The patient experienced two episodes of melena overnight, which could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and hematocrit levels is necessary.
5. Liver Mass: The patient has a liver mass, but further imaging is needed to characterize it. However, the patient cannot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) for concern of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. He is being transferred to [Hospital1] with the same concerns. The patient has had several significant events since admission, including fever, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, melena, liver mass, CMV positivity, head bobbing, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), acute renal failure (ARF), and a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD). He underwent a G-tube/duodenal tube barium study, which showed a leak in the duodenal tube and vomited up barium with blood in the JP drain. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has multiple drains in place, including a colostomy, biliary drain, and three JP drains. The patient is on various medications, including antibiotics, antifungal agents, and supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever and has positive cultures for gram-negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) in the peritoneal fluid, suggesting a possible intra-abdominal infection. Additionally, he is C. difficile positive. There is concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, and hematoma. Close monitoring of fever and follow-up blood cultures are recommended. The patient should continue on meropenem, vancomycin, and mic"

","The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of severe pancreatitis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and septic shock. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various treatments including vasopressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal medication, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 

The patient's recent events include the development of a yeast infection in his abdominal fluid, confirmed as Candida albicans. He has also been experiencing hypernatremia, which has improved to 142 by PM labs. The patient underwent a barium study for a planned gastrostomy tube placement, but it showed a leak in the duodenal tube and no progression of barium through the stomach. He vomited up the barium, had blood in his drain, and melena at 9pm. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 147/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -704 mL and a blood product transfusion of 1,985 mL. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 27.1 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels of 1.9 mmol/L. His electrolytes reveal hyponatremia with a sodium level of 142 mEq/L, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and normal glucose levels at 113 mg/dL. His liver function tests indicate elevated liver enzymes with ALT at 347 U/L and AST at 134 U/L. 

The patient's plan includes continuing TPN, monitoring for glycemic control, and managing his yeast infection with micafungin. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)."

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of gastric artery laceration during ERCP, prolonged course with multiple OR trips. He has a duodenostomy tube with a leak and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
- Heart rate: 82 bpm (68-85)
- Blood pressure: 134/68 mmHg (85)
- Respiratory rate: 33 breaths per minute (20-43)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy mask and has an ABG result of ///17/. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart and lung sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and right and left lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 338 K/uL
- Platelet count: 113 mg/dL
- Sodium: 1.0 mg/dL
- Potassium: 17 mEq/L
- Chloride: 3.9 mEq/L
- Carbon dioxide: 37 mg/dL
- Glucose: 113 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 1.6
- Total bilirubin: 27.1%
- Albumin: 2.2 g/dL

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antifungal medication, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. He is also on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to his inability to tolerate oral intake and possible duodenal leak.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Infection: The patient has abdominal sepsis and is at risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is on respiratory support. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure if his condition does not improve.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and history of gastric artery laceration put him at risk of bleeding complications.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. This could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Gastrointestinal leakage: The presence of a duodenostomy tube leak increases the risk of gastrointestinal leakage and potential sepsis.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery: Plan to start tube feeds through the duodenostomy tube
   tomorrow. Follow output on drains to see where leakage.
   - ID: continue current ABX regimen, + CMV VL likely due to multiple
   transfusions. Recommend that if scoped by GI then can biopsy
   - GI: no plan to scope, signed off
   - Neurology: EEG did have one peroid of suspicious focal left temporal
   activity without clinical correlate, no alteration in consciousness.
   Caveat that this was poor quality given that recorded at end of 48 hour
   period.
   - Duodenostomy study:
   1. Percutaneous duodenostomy tube with small leakage seen around the
   catheter entrance into the duodenum, with tracking along the catheter
   and liver. No definite biliary leak of contrast that refluxed into the
   biliary system, though a small contained leak at the T tube entrance
   site to the CBD can not be excluded.
   2. Gastrojejunostomy was filled retrograde but unable to distend
   completely, a followup radiograph in 45- 60 minutes is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium slowly increasing to 146 this morning.
   - restart D5W @ 100cc/hr x 1 liter
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Surgery recommending tube feeds via duodenostomy tube; will clarify
   with surgery as contrast has not progressed
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is being transferred to another hospital with concerns of an infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure.
- The patient was febrile but is now afebrile since May 15th at noon.
- He is c. difficile positive and has been receiving antibiotics including meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin.
- The patient has respiratory failure and is on a tracheostomy with previous ventilation support. He is currently on a tracheal collar and doing well.
- His sodium levels are high, so D5W is being restarted to correct hypernatremia.
- The patient had episodes of melena overnight but remained hemodynamically stable.
- His liver mass is being monitored, and further imaging may be needed to characterize it.
- The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to minimal gas throughout the small and large bowel and duodenostomy study with contrast not progressing beyond the duodenum.
- The patient is CMV positive and needs follow-up with infectious disease recommendations.
- There was a concern about seizure activity or head bobbing, but the EEG read is pending.
- His liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated but trending down, possibly due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.
- The patient reached a peak creatinine level of 1.9 from"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery: Plan to start tube feeds through the duodenostomy tube
   tomorrow. Follow output on drains to see where leakage.
   - ID: continue current ABX regimen, + CMV VL likely due to multiple
   transfusions. Recommend that if scoped by GI then can biopsy
   - GI: no plan to scope, signed off
   - Neurology: EEG did have one peroid of suspicious focal left temporal
   activity without clinical correlate, no alteration in consciousness.
   Caveat that this was poor quality given that recorded at end of 48 hour
   period.
   - Duodenostomy study:
   1. Percutaneous duodenostomy tube with small leakage seen around the
   catheter entrance into the duodenum, with tracking along the catheter
   and liver. No definite biliary leak of contrast that refluxed into the
   biliary system, though a small contained leak at the T tube entrance
   site to the CBD can not be excluded.
   2. Gastrojejunostomy was filled retrograde but unable to distend
   completely, a followup radiograph in 45- 60 minutes is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is being transferred to our facility with concerns for an infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently afebrile but was previously positive for fever. He is c. difficile positive and has a history of multiple transfusions, which may have led to CMV reactivation. The patient has a tracheostomy and was on mechanical ventilation but has been transitioned to a tracheal collar and is doing well.

The patient is hypernatremic and is receiving D5W at 100cc/hr x 1 liter to correct this. He has experienced two episodes of melena overnight but remains hemodynamically stable. The patient's HCT is stable, and he is being monitored closely. He also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which are trending down.

The patient has a history of seizures and an abnormal EEG showing focal left temporal activity without any clinical correlate. There is a concern for potential complications such as infected mesh, hematoma, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, melena, liver mass, CMV reactivation, elevated LFTs, acute renal failure (ARF), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic regurgitation, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infected mesh: The patient has signs of infection at the surgical site, including"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of multiple bowel surgeries and intraabdominal sepsis, following gastric artery laceration. The patient's condition includes altered mental status, fever, hypernatremia, gastrointestinal bleed, wound infection, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, TPN without lipids, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/75 mmHg to 92/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, development of multiorgan dysfunction, worsening of the gastrointestinal bleed, and possible infection due to the presence of the wound infection."

   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve

   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.

   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with downtrending HCT this morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.

   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to coordinate today with IR for possible placement.

   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.

   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [Hospital1] with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. 

The patient has a history of fever, likely due to an intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid. There is also a concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, and hematoma. The patient was previously c. difficile positive but is currently afebrile since [2123-5-15] at noon.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, as he has been transitioned from mechanical ventilation to a tracheostomy collar and is doing well for several days. However, there is bilious/purulent drainage from the proximal incision site, and cultures have been sent.

The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 145, which is being monitored closely. He also has melena and is being monitored for any signs of active bleeding. The patient's liver mass is also being evaluated, with normal AFP levels.

Regarding nutrition, the patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to the inability to advance feeds through the gastrointestinal tract. Enteral feeding is optimal but will require coordination with either gastroenterology (GI) or interventional radiology (IR) to place a"

   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium stable at 145
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with downtrending HCT this morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to coordinate today with IR for possible placement.

   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [Hospital1] with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. 

Based on the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Intra-abdominal infection: The patient has a history of fever and positive cultures for gram-negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid, suggesting an intra-abdominal infection. This could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.

2. Surgical site infection: The patient's surgical incision is now open with bilious/purulent drainage, indicating a possible surgical site infection. This can be caused by bacteria entering the wound during surgery or due to inadequate wound care postoperatively.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure with an ABG showing primary respiratory alkalosis. He was previously on mechanical ventilation but has been transitioned to a tracheostomy collar. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 145 mEq/L, which needs to be corrected to avoid complications like neurological impairment and seizures.

5. Melena: The patient has experienced two episodes of melena overnight, which could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring the hematocrit (HCT) levels and transfusing if HCT <"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - Speech/swallow to visit today for valve placement to enable pt to
   speak
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 141 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to go to IR for procedure -  this intervention will require
   contrast dye; patient currently being loaded with solumedrol,
   famotidine, and Benadryl.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [Hospital1] with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including CAD, ARF, CMV+, and hepatitis C infection.

The patient's recent medical events include fever, which is most likely due to an intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods (E. coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid. The patient also has a positive c. difficile test. The patient's respiratory status has improved since being transitioned from mechanical ventilation to a tracheostomy collar.

The patient's current assessment includes hypernatremia, which was managed with the administration of D5W. The patient's melena, liver mass, nutrition, CMV status, head bobbing (possible seizure activity), elevated liver function tests (LFTs), cracked molar, acute renal failure (ARF), CAD, aortic regurgitation, and hyperglycemia are all being closely monitored.

The patient's plan includes continuing meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin for infection prophylaxis and treatment. The patient will also continue on Flagyl for c. difficile and receive suppressive therapy for CMV. Further imaging is needed to characterize the liver mass. The patient's feeding tube placement and nutritional support will be coordinated with"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to another hospital with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. 

The patient has a history of fever, which was most likely due to an intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid. He also tested positive for C. difficile.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, transitioning from mechanical ventilation to a tracheostomy collar. However, he experienced one episode of tachypnea last night in the 30s. 

There is concern for incision drainage with bilious/purulent drainage from the proximal incision site. 

The patient continues to have hypernatremia and received 1 liter of D5W. His sodium level stabilized at 141 this morning. 

The patient has episodes of melena but remains hemodynamically stable with a stable HCT this morning. 

Further evaluation is needed for a liver mass with normal AFP levels. 

Nutritionally, the patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and requires enteral feeding. A duodenostomy study showed minimal gas throughout the small and large bowel, and drains are still draining white contrast. 

The patient tested positive for CMV and requires further follow-up with infectious disease recommendations.

   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely

 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 141 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.

   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities). If LFTs
   normalize may transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 142 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; then
   changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have required
   contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and Benadryl.
   - feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is now being transferred to a new hospital. The patient's current health conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Infected mesh and hematoma: The patient has concerns for infected mesh and hematoma, indicating a possible surgical site infection. The patient was previously febrile but has been afebrile since May 15th.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure and is currently on a tracheostomy (trach) with mechanical ventilation. The ABG results show primary respiratory alkalosis. The patient has been transitioned to a trach collar and is doing well, but there was one episode of tachypnea last night.

3. Incision drainage: The surgical incision is draining bilious/purulent fluid, suggesting a possible infection. Further evaluation and treatment are recommended.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 142. This was managed by giving 1 liter of D5W, which stabilized the sodium level.

5. Melena: The patient has episodes of melena, which could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is stable hemodynamically, and their HCT is stable as well. Monitoring and transfusion for HCT <25 or active bleeding are recommended.

6. Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass with normal AFP levels. Further imaging"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities). If LFTs
   normalize may transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 142 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; then
   changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have required
   contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and Benadryl.
   - feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an OSH and is now being transferred to Hospital1 with concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of fever, respiratory alkalosis, tracheostomy, hypernatremia, melena, liver mass, CMV positivity, head bobbing, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), cracked molar, acute renal failure (ARF), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic regurgitation, and hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of infected mesh and hematoma, as well as being C. difficile positive. There is a concern for surgical site infection and intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on a tracheostomy collar. Close monitoring of respiratory status is required.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia and received D5W to correct it. Sodium levels need to be closely monitored.
4. Melena: The patient has episodes of melena, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring hemodynamic stability and considering transfusion for HCT <25 or active bleeding.
5. Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass with normal AFP levels. Further imaging is needed to characterize the mass, but the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old individual with a history of chronic respiratory failure and post-surgical abdominal infection. The patient underwent multiple surgeries due to a gastric artery laceration during an ERCP procedure.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, respiratory failure, wound infection, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), gastrointestinal bleed, and altered nutrition. The patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 bpm, elevated blood pressure ranging from 142/85 to 157/87 mmHg, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 99% on a tracheostomy collar.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient also has hypernatremia and hypoglycemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild purulent drainage at the superior aspect of a midline incision, bilateral lower extremity edema, and warm skin. The patient is somnolent but denies pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of abdominal infection and current signs of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.

   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum. Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding
   tube; then changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have
   required contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and
   Benadryl.
   Feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is now being transferred to another hospital with concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient was initially febrile but has since become afebrile. He is positive for C. difficile. The patient's abdominal incision is showing bilious/purulent drainage from the proximal incision site.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected mesh and hematoma: The patient's surgical site may be infected, leading to further complications such as wound dehiscence or the spread of infection to surrounding tissues.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as indicated by the need for tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring is required to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory distress.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient's positive result for C. difficile indicates an increased risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. Appropriate measures should be taken to manage this infection and prevent its spread.
4. Abdominal pathology: The presence of bilious/purulent drainage from the abdominal incision suggests a possible intra-abdominal infection. This could progress to peritonitis if not appropriately managed.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent neurological complications.
6. Melena: The patient's episodes of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with a diagnosis of severe sepsis secondary to an abdominal infection. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 71/22 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on aerosol-cool tracheal mask. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is connected to multiple IV lines.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole, and micafungin. His central line was placed on 05/16/2123, and he has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since 05/23/2123. He is also receiving a Vivonex (full) enteral nutrition at 20 mL/hour.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. His electrolytes are within normal limits except for a slightly low potassium level. His liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and bilirubin levels are also elevated. His renal function tests show a slightly elevated creatinine level.

The patient's daily fluid balance has been negative, indicating ongoing fluid losses. The patient has been producing a significant amount of urine and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [Hospital1] with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has been febrile since admission but is now afebrile since [2123-5-15] at noon. He is positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and has been treated with flagyl IV. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic regurgitation, hyperglycemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), liver mass, hepatitis C infection, and CMV positivity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections due to his immunocompromised state, positive C. diff status, and surgical interventions. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of infection promptly.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation (MV). Continuous monitoring of respiratory status, oxygenation, and ABG results is crucial to assess the effectiveness of respiratory support.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia, which needs to be closely monitored. Frequent measurements of serum sodium levels and appropriate management are essential to prevent complications such as dehydration or neurological abnormalities"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Fever/Abdominal Pathology:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection
   with gram negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal
   fluid.  Concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.
   Patient now afebrile since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c.
   difficile positive.  Vancomycin discontinued on [**2123-5-22**].
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem (6 week course)
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff (day 1 = [**5-16**])
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities).
   - f/u LFTs normalize consider transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   - plan to transfer pt to surgery team today
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum. Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding
   tube; then changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have
   required contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and
   Benadryl.
   Feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs. Tolerating tube feeds at 10cc for
   24 hours so advancing slowly towards goal of 80cc/hr.
   - currently on TPN
   - Continue tube feeds and advance slowly towards 80cc/hr
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   .
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: No further hypernatremia
   - check sodium qd
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN, TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: plan to transfer to surgery service today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [Hospital1] with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis C infection.

The patient's recent medical events include fever, abdominal pathology with possible intra-abdominal infection, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, wound infection with bilious/purulent drainage from the surgical incision site, hypernatremia, melena, liver mass, CMV positivity, head bobbing possibly indicating seizure activity, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), cracked molar, acute renal failure (ARF), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic regurgitation, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure of 71/22 mmHg, heart rate of 111 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on aerosol-cool tracheostomy mask. The patient is intubated and interactive.

The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole, micafungin), pantoprazole, and TPN without lipids. The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's planned interventions include continuing meropenem for a 6-week course, continuing flagyl IV for C. diff, transitioning to fluconazole for yeast infection, attempting tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube, transitioning to tracheostomy collar, and monitoring respiratory status closely. The patient will also be evaluated for surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma, and other complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods.
2. Surgical site infection, infected mesh, and hematoma.
3. Respiratory failure due to tracheostomy and weaning from mechanical ventilation.
4. Clostridium difficile infection.
5. Wound infection with bilious/purulent drainage from the surgical incision site.
6. Hypernatremia.
7. Melena and gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Liver mass and potential malignancy.
9. CMV infection and possible complications.
10. Head bobbing and seizure activity.
11. Elevated liver function tests.
12. Cracked molar and potential aspiration.
13. Acute renal failure.
14. Coronary artery disease and aortic regurgitation.
