   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of essential thrombocytosis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), who underwent an ex-lap with LOA and hernia repair. She was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which reverted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) after receiving amiodarone bolus/gtt and fluids. She also has elevated cardiac biomarkers, chest pain, and EKG changes concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/66 to 87/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her temperature is within normal range at 37Â°C.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,572 mL and output of 1,142 mL since midnight, with a urine output of 35 mL. She is receiving amiodarone gtt for AFIB and heparin gtt for anticoagulation, although the heparin gtt has been held due to concerns about bleeding risk post-surgery. An echocardiogram is pending.

The patient has elevated troponins, with a level of 0.31, as well as elevated CK levels at 409. The EKG shows filled-in T-waves in leads V3"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of essential thrombocytosis and GERD who underwent an ex-lap with LOA and hernia repair. She was transferred to the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which reverted to normal sinus rhythm after administration of amiodarone and intravenous fluids. The patient also presented with elevated cardiac biomarkers, chest pain, and EKG changes concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The patient's current assessment includes atrial fibrillation, hypotension, elevated troponins, chest pain, post-ex lap status, oliguria, acute renal failure (ARF), and GERD. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has since reverted to normal sinus rhythm. Continuous monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary to prevent further episodes.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was initially low, but resolved after restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Close monitoring of blood pressure is required, and appropriate interventions should be taken if hypotension recurs.

3. Elevated troponins: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating potential myocardial injury. This suggests ongoing ischemia or a recent myocardial infarction. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and continued cardiac monitoring is recommended.

4. Chest pain: The patient"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of essential thrombocytosis and GERD who underwent an ex-lap with LOA and hernia repair. She was transferred from surgery for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), which reverted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) after receiving an amiodarone bolus/gtt and fluids.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced episodes of AFib with RVR, which responded minimally to metoprolol but converted back to NSR after receiving a dose of amiodarone.
2. Cardiac biomarker elevation: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
3. Oliguria: The patient continues to have low urine output (UOP), which appeared to respond to fluid boluses. This suggests hypovolemia, and the patient will be given more intravenous fluids to address this issue.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 1.8, likely due to hypovolemia. Close monitoring of respiratory status is advised as an echocardiogram (echo) is pending.

   However following d/c of drip pt went back into A fib. Following
   several doses of IV and PO Metoprolol pt showed minimal response still
   carrying A-fib rates in the 110s-130s. Following Amiodarone 400mg at
   0800 pt was noticed on rounds to be back in NSR.  Cardiology is
   currently aware that pt went back in A, fib with RVR. Pt also received
   bolus IVF yesterday which appeared not to help the pt

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with essential thrombocytosis and GERD who underwent an ex-lap with LOA and hernia repair. She was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which initially reverted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) after receiving an amiodarone bolus and fluids. However, she subsequently went back into atrial fibrillation. Despite receiving several doses of intravenous and oral metoprolol, there was only minimal response, and her heart rate remained in the 110s-130s. She was then given an additional 400mg of amiodarone, resulting in her returning to NSR. Cardiology is aware that she went back into atrial fibrillation with RVR.

The patient also has elevated cardiac biomarkers, with Troponin-T levels ranging from 0.26-0.32. This suggests the possibility of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). She received a bolus of intravenous fluids yesterday but did not show any improvement in her atrial fibrillation rate. She continues on heparin gtt and will likely need systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin due to a CHADS score of 4 and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). An echocardiogram has been ordered but not yet performed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), small bowel obstruction, anemia, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. The patient experienced a recurrence of AFib when the amiodarone infusion was stopped, but converted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) after being given additional oral amiodarone. The patient is currently asymptomatic when in AFib.

The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by rising creatinine levels and new-onset metabolic acidosis. The patient is receiving heparin therapy and various other ICU medications.

On review of systems, the patient's vital signs remain relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/74 to 139/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,472 mL with an output of 520 mL, resulting in a balance of 3,952 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. Extremities show mild edema without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination is within normal limits.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL and an elevated white blood cell count of 12.8 K/uL."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   80 yo F with essential thrombocytosis and GERD s/p ex-lap with LOA and
   hernia repair transferred from surgery for afib with RVR which reverted
   to NSR after amio bolus/gtt and fluids.  Also with cardic biomarker
   elevation, chest pain and EKG changes concerning for ACS.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Broke with amiodarone gtt and IVF boluses.
   However following d/c of drip pt went back into A fib. Following
   several doses of IV and PO Metoprolol pt showed minimal response still
   carrying A-fib rates in the 110s-130s. Following initiation of
   Amiodarone [**Hospital1 **] dosing yesterday pt reverted back into NSR.  Cardiology
   consult recommended changing amiodarone dosing to 200mg TID x 6 days
   starting today, then 200mg x 4 weeks and then 200mg daily. Cards also
   recommended low dose beta blockade for post MI cardiac protection.
   - Still in NSR, appreciate card recs will change Amiodarone dosing to
   TID 200mg, will also started Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue on heparin gtt, will likely need systemic anticoag with
   coumadin given CHADS score of 4, hx of CVA. Will discuss with surgery
   regarding anticoagulation
   - echo ordered will likely receive today
   # Elevated Troponins:  Troponins currently trending down  0.27
0.23.
   Will continue pt on Heparin gtt for possible Coumadin versus Lovenox
   bridge. Will start on full dose ASA and low dose beta blocker as pt is
   post MI.
   - continue heparin gtt, ASA 325mg qday, Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # S/p Ex Lap:  Doing well, has some pain at incision site
   - f/u surgery recs
   - d/c dilaudid pca and write for po

   - ADAT to sips
   # Oliguria:  UOP improving following IVF bolus, pt
s non-anion gap
   acidosis improving with LR blousing rather than NS bolus. Will bolus
   again 500cc this AM.
   - trend UOP
   - bolus with LR IVF
   - repeat PM lytes to check for hyperkalemia
   # ARF:  Cr 1.8 now up from 1.7, unknown baseline but several days ago
   Cr was 1.1.  Likely [**3-2**] to hypovolemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with essential thrombocytosis and GERD who underwent an ex-lap with LOA and hernia repair.
- She was transferred from surgery for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which reverted to normal sinus rhythm after amiodarone bolus and fluids.
- The patient also experienced chest pain and EKG changes concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- She broke into atrial fibrillation again following the discontinuation of the amiodarone drip but reverted back to normal sinus rhythm after several doses of IV and PO metoprolol.
- Cardiology recommended changing the amiodarone dosing to 200 mg TID x 6 days, then 200 mg x 4 weeks, and finally 200 mg daily.
- They also recommended low-dose beta-blockade for post-MI cardiac protection.
- The patient continues on heparin gtt and will likely need systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin due to a CHADS score of 4 and history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
- An echo has been ordered and will likely receive today.
- Troponins are currently trending down.
- The patient is doing well post-ex lap with some pain at the incision site.
- Pain control measures have been implemented.
- Oliguria improved following IV fluid bolus, and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is improving with LR blo"

   80 yo F with essential thrombocytosis and GERD s/p ex-lap with LOA and
   hernia repair transferred from surgery for afib with RVR which reverted
   to NSR after amio bolus/gtt and fluids.  Also with cardic biomarker
   elevation, chest pain and EKG changes concerning for ACS.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Broke with amiodarone gtt and IVF boluses.
   However following d/c of drip pt went back into A fib. Following
   several doses of IV and PO Metoprolol pt showed minimal response still
   carrying A-fib rates in the 110s-130s. Following initiation of
   Amiodarone [**Hospital1 **] dosing yesterday pt reverted back into NSR.  Cardiology
   consult recommended changing amiodarone dosing to 200mg TID x 6 days
   starting today, then 200mg x 4 weeks and then 200mg daily. Cards also
   recommended low dose beta blockade for post MI cardiac protection.
   - Still in NSR, appreciate card recs will change Amiodarone dosing to
   TID 200mg, will also started Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue on heparin gtt, will likely need systemic anticoag with
   coumadin given CHADS score of 4, hx of CVA. Will discuss with surgery
   regarding anticoagulation
