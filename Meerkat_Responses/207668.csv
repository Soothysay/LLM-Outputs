   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been admitted with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease). The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 84/52 mmHg, and hypothermia with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face tent and has an oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR), and low albumin levels. There are also signs of infection with elevated white blood cell count and elevated lactic acid levels. 

The plan for the patient includes further diagnostic tests such as a V/Q scan for pulmonary embolism, an echocardiogram, and bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound to assess for deep vein thrombosis. The patient is also receiving ICU care, including nutrition and glycemic control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension leading to organ dysfunction, infections due to immunosuppression, and coagulopathy. Close monitoring and prompt management of these potential complications are necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Unfortunate and complicated 74 yr old gentleman with progressive
   hepatic failure who was transferred to MICU for worsening hypoxemia and
   hypotension overnight.
   1. Hypoxemia: Initially profound of the floor but is actually improving
   today.
   DDx: PE
 LENIs negative, will get VQ,
            Shunt: echo w/ bubble to look for ASD VSD large PFO
   Another possibiolity is that he had a sign aspiration event and though
   CXR is unimpressive given his little reserve this accounts for profound
   hypoxemia. Certainly would fit with the sense that his O2 requirements
   are less this AM- though we need to change to Venti mask to try to
   quantify this.
   2. Hypotension: SBP has remained in 90s after gentle IVF out on floor.
   Looks like he has been in that range on floor over past 48 hrs.
   Possible he was hypovolemic with poor pos but as outlined below brewing
   sepsis is also of concern.
   2. Leukocytosis: also had transient hypothermia overnight, certainly at
   risk for infection and we have pan cultured
   Sources: Asp PNA -  CXr not really impressive but could lag, will add
   Flagyl to his Ceftriaxone
                  SBP change to full Rx dosing of Ceftriaxone.  We can
   repeat US to see if there is a tappable pocket but previously this had
   been not amenable.
                  Follow up blood and urine and C diff (empiric Flagyl
   while waiting)
   3. Mental Status: worsened on the floor, presumed encephalopathy,
   increased lactulose would not give anti psychotics
   Discuss with Hepatology role of Rifaxamin
   4. GI bleed: HCt has been stable< PPI

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with progressive hepatic failure, who was admitted to the MICU for worsening hypoxemia and hypotension. The patient's chief complaints are hypoxemia, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and hypotension.

The patient's review of systems shows fatigue, no fever or weight loss, dyspnea (shortness of breath), abdominal pain, and encephalopathic (altered mental status). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/57 mmHg to 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a face tent.

Physical examination findings include cachexia (weight loss and muscle wasting), clear chest to auscultation, distended abdomen with mild tenderness to deep palpation, cachectic extremities with no edema, and altered mental status.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), hyponatremia (low sodium level), hyperkalemia (high potassium level), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated bilirubin levels, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PT"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypoxemia, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and hypotension. They have no known drug allergies and received their last dose of antibiotics, Ceftriaxone, on September 23rd at 10:00 PM. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/57 mmHg to 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a face tent and has an arterial blood gas result of ///22/. Physical examination reveals a cachetic appearance, clear chest auscultation, mild abdominal tenderness, and no edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, low creatinine, low glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is currently being treated for hypoxemia, leukocytosis, mental status changes, and suspected gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and ARF indicate significant respiratory compromise. If not adequately managed, there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, fever, and positive blood cultures suggest the presence of an infection. If left untreated, this could progress to sepsis, leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and abnormal liver function tests raise concerns about hepatic encephalopathy. If not addressed promptly, this condition can lead to worsening cognitive impairment and potential coma.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of abdominal pain and low blood pressure may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. If not identified and treated promptly, this can result in significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing DVT. If not appropriately prophylaxed against, the patient may develop a clot, which could potentially embolize and cause life-threatening complications.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Adequate precautions and strategies should be implemented to minimize this risk.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based solely on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, lung cancer surgery (lobectomy), and anorexia for three months. He was transferred from OSH after experiencing an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed with decompensated liver disease. The patient is currently on hospital day #23 with new symptoms including hypoxia, hypotension, and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The sudden change in hypoxia suggests an event such as aspiration from newly restarted tube feeds, pulmonary embolism (PE), opening of patent foramen ovale (PFO) due to worsening liver failure, or pneumonia. The chest X-ray (CXR) shows diminished lung markings on the left likely due to right lower lobe (RLL) lobectomy and appears similar to prior films, but no infiltrate is seen.
2. Hypotension: The hypotension resolved with the administration of 1 liter of fluid, likely in response to an acute event causing hypoxia. Monitoring and gentle boluses to maintain pressure in the 90s should be continued.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia may be evidence of infection given leukocytosis. Leukocytosis has been long-standing but recently rose to 18 and responded to empirical treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Multiple urine cultures have been negative, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out twice. The CXR does not show signs of infection. Cultures are pending.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is variable but elevated for over a week. It improved starting with ceftriaxone (CTX) for presumed SBP. All other cultures have been negative, and cultures are still pending.
5. Acute on Chronic Change in Mental Status (MS): The patient has shown a decline in mental status over the past five days according to the patient's wife. He is now on restraints. Leukocytosis has decreased from 18 to 12, and the CXR shows no new infiltrate. Upper endoscopy (EGD) revealed small varices and gastritis without obvious obstruction. The patient likely has alcoholic hepatitis with worsening hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Anorexia: The patient's anorexia is likely related to ETOH cirrhosis. He has been restarted on tube feeds, and his condition correlates with the timing of jaundice.
7. Ethanol Cirrhosis: The patient's ETOH cirrhosis may be contributing to his current condition. No sign of malignancy was found on biopsy or CT abdomen. Small varices and gastritis were observed during the EGD.
8. Jaundice: The patient's jaundice is likely due to ETOH cirrhosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with progressive hepatic failure, who was admitted to the MICU for worsening hypoxemia and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 34.8°C (94.7°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/55 to 66/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a venti mask. The patient's physical examination shows that he is cachetic, lying in bed, and has fair air movement in his chest. His abdomen is distended with bowel sounds present. Laboratory results indicate liver dysfunction, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient initially had profound hypoxemia, but it is improving today. Possible causes include pulmonary embolism, shunt (such as ASD, VSD, or large PFO), or aspiration event. Further diagnostic tests, such as a repeat chest X-ray and an echo with bubble study, may be needed to identify the exact cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains in the 90s despite fluid resuscitation. Discontinuing lasix and spironolactone, administering albumin and low-dose fluid bolus, and adjusting antibiotic dosing may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with progressive hepatic failure, who was transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxemia and hypotension overnight. He is profoundly jaundiced, cachectic, and eviscerated, with poor air movement in the chest and abdominal distention. He has leukocytosis, hypothermia, and an elevated creatinine level. He is also experiencing mental status changes and has a history of GI bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient initially had profound hypoxemia, but it has improved and plateaued. Possible causes include pulmonary embolism (PE), aspiration pneumonia, or a large pulmonary shunt. Further investigations such as CT angiography (CTA) and echocardiogram (echo) with bubble study are needed to rule out these possibilities.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remained in the 90s after fluid resuscitation on the floor. Dehydration might have been a contributing factor initially, but with evolving leukocytosis and hypothermia, sepsis is also a concern. The patient's condition improved with albumin and low-dose fluid bolus, but further evaluation is needed.

3. Hypothermia/Leukocytosis: The patient is cachectic and potentially infected, with a possible source of infection being gastrointestinal. The addition of Flagyl to the current antibiotic regimen is warranted. Monitoring blood and"

   Another possibiolity is that he had a sign aspiration event and though
   CXR is unimpressive given his little reserve this accounts for profound
   hypoxemia. Certainly would fit with the sense that his O2 requirements
   are less this AM- though we need to change to Venti mask to try to
   quantify this.
   2. Hypotension: SBP has remained in 90s after gentle IVF out on floor.
   Looks like he has been in that range on floor over past 48 hrs.
   Possible he was hypovolemic with poor pos but as outlined below brewing
   sepsis is also of concern.
   2. Leukocytosis: also had transient hypothermia overnight, certainly at
   risk for infection and we have pan cultured
   Sources: Asp PNA -  CXr not really impressive but could lag, will add
   Flagyl to his Ceftriaxone
                  SBP change to full Rx dosing of Ceftriaxone.  We can

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with progressive hepatic failure, worsening hypoxemia, and hypotension. He was transferred to the MICU for further management. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 112/55 mmHg (66/36-115/68 mmHg), respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a venti mask. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. The patient has received several medications, including Lansoprazole, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole. 

24-hour events:
- The patient received Ceftriaxone at 01:03 AM on 09/24/2140.
- The patient received Metronidazole at 07:59 AM on 09/25/2140.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,755 mL, including 304 mL of total IV fluids, and output of 2,624 mL, including 302 mL of IV output, 150 mL of blood products, and 1,924 mL of urine. The patient's NG output was 700 mL, and drain output was 186 mL. The total negative fluid balance is -869 mL.

Lab Results:
- Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 21.3 K/uL
- Platelet count: 129 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
- Glucose: 73 mg/dL
- Other lab results include elevated PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, and abnormal differential with increased neutrophils.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient initially had profound hypoxemia but is currently improving. Possible causes include pulmonary embolism, shunt, or aspiration. A V/Q scan, echocardiogram with bubble study, and chest X-ray will be performed to evaluate these possibilities.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains in the 90s despite IV fluid administration. Possible causes include hypovolemia and sepsis. Sepsis is a concern, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. An abdominal ultrasound will be repeated to assess for any tappable ascites.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient also had transient hypothermia overnight. Infection is a concern, and cultures have been obtained.
4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status has worsened on the floor, presumed to be due to encephalopathy. Increased lactulose will be given, and the role of Rifaximin will be discussed with hepatology.
5. GI bleed: The patient's HCT has been stable, and a PPI has been given.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient requires nutritional support.
- Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels will be monitored and managed.
- Lines: The patient has multiple IV lines.
- Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP prophylaxis.
- Code status: Full code.
- Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, lung cancer surgery, and anorexia. He was admitted to the hospital due to a gastrointestinal bleed and decompensated liver disease. The patient has been in the ICU for 24 days and is currently experiencing hypothermia, hypoxia, hypotension, hypernatremia, acute on chronic change in mental status, anorexia, and an unclear etiology for jaundice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis. He is being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with antibiotics and albumin.
2. Hypoxia: The sudden change in oxygen saturation suggests a possible event such as aspiration from tube feeds, pulmonary embolism (PE), opening of patent foramen ovale (PFO) due to worsening liver failure, or pneumonia. Further investigation is needed, including repeating the chest X-ray and continuing oxygenation via a ventilator mask.
3. Hypotension: The patient responded well to fluids, but it is important to maintain blood pressure and urine output. The possibility of hypovolemic shock or adrenal insufficiency (hypocortisolism) should be considered.
4. Hypernatremia: Despite administration of D5W, the patient's sodium level remains unchanged at 150 mEq"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, previous lung cancer surgery, and a recent transfer from OSH due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been hospitalized for 23 days and presents with new-onset hypoxia, hypotension, and leukocytosis. The patient is being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with antibiotics, albumin, and supportive care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The sudden change in oxygen levels suggests an event such as aspiration from newly restarted tube feeds, pulmonary embolism (PE), opening of patent foramen ovale (PFO) due to worsening liver failure, or pneumonia. A chest X-ray has shown diminished lung markings on the left, which may be due to the patient's right lung lobectomy. There are no significant infiltrates seen on the X-ray, but further evaluation is needed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be attributed to sepsis or a free water deficit. Sepsis is a concern due to the presence of leukocytosis and suspected SBP. On the other hand, hypernatremia indicates a possible free water deficit. 

3. Acute on Chronic Change in Mental Status: The patient has become less oriented over the past five days, according to his wife. Leukocytosis has improved, but increasing liver function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, previous lung cancer surgery, and a 3-month history of anorexia. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing an upper gastrointestinal bleed and decompensated liver disease. Currently, the patient is on hospital day #24 and is experiencing new symptoms including hypoxia, hypotension, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypotension suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. Treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with antibiotics, albumin, and vancomycin has been initiated.
2. Hypoxia: The sudden change in oxygen saturation suggests an event such as aspiration from newly restarted tube feeds, pulmonary embolism (PE), opening of patent foramen ovale (PFO) due to worsening liver failure, or pneumonia. Further evaluation with a repeat chest X-ray is needed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure responded well to fluid administration. Sepsis, hypovolemic shock, and adrenal insufficiency (hypocortisolism) are in the differential diagnosis. Goals include maintaining systolic blood pressure in the 90s, cautious fluid administration, consent for blood transfusion, and type and screen.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels did not change despite administration of"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, lung cancer status post lobectomy, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for 24 days and has multiple medical complications.

1. Hypoxia: The patient has sudden changes in oxygen saturation levels, which could be due to aspiration from newly restarted tube feeds, pulmonary embolism (PE), opening of patent foramen ovale (PFO) due to worsening liver failure, or pneumonia. The chest X-ray shows diminished lung markings on the left side, likely due to the right lower lobe lobectomy.

2. Hypotension: The patient responded well to fluid resuscitation. There is a concern for sepsis, but hypovolemic shock is also in the differential diagnosis, especially considering the drop in hematocrit. Hypocortisolism should also be considered.

3. Hypernatremia: Despite administration of 1L of D5W, the patient's sodium level remains unchanged at 150. The free water deficit is approximately 3L. More free water needs to be administered today, and Dobhoff can be used for additional free water flushes every 4 hours.

4. Acute on chronic change in mental status: The patient's orientation has worsened over the past 5 days. Leukocytosis has improved, and there are no new infiltrates on the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, previous lung cancer surgery, and a recent transfer from another hospital for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been in the ICU for 24 days and is currently experiencing hypothermia, hypoxia, hypotension, hypernatremia, acute on chronic change in mental status, anorexia, and increased bilirubin levels.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature has been consistently low, indicating potential complications related to the ICU environment or underlying medical conditions.
2. Hypoxia: The sudden change in oxygen levels suggests an event such as aspiration, pulmonary embolism, opening of patent foramen ovale, or pneumonia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure responded well to fluid administration. Sepsis and hypovolemic shock are in the differential diagnosis. Hypocortisolism should also be considered.
4. Hypernatremia: Despite administration of D5W, the patient's sodium levels remain high. A significant free water deficit of approximately 3 L needs to be addressed. Additional free water should be given via Dobhoff.
5. Acute on Chronic Change in Mental Status: The patient's orientation has worsened over the past few days. Leukocytosis, lack of new infiltrates on chest X-ray, and increasing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, lung cancer surgery, and recent hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal bleed. He was admitted 24 days ago with decompensated liver disease and now presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has been treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and sepsis, but continues to have hypernatremia, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status suggest a possible ongoing infection leading to sepsis. It is important to continue treating for SBP and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's increased levels of bilirubin, altered mental status, and lack of follow-up with lactulose enema indicate worsening hepatic encephalopathy. It is crucial to continue lactulose therapy and monitor for further deterioration.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's increased creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, which may be due to pre-renal azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Further evaluation and management are needed to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia and hypotension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, previous lung cancer surgery, and a recent transfer from another hospital due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently on hospital day #24 and has been experiencing hypoxia, hypotension, and other complications. The patient has multiple medical issues including decompensated liver disease, anorexia, and worsening hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypothermia may indicate a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient is being treated for SBP with antibiotics and albumin. This condition can occur in patients with cirrhosis and can lead to severe infections.
3. Hypoxia: The sudden change in the patient's oxygen levels suggests an event such as aspiration, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's increasing liver function tests and worsening mental status indicate possible hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure.
5. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's increase in creatinine levels is concerning for pre-renal azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure associated with severe liver disease.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and risk factors for clotting make him prone to developing DVT.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, lung cancer status post lobectomy, and a recent 3-month history of anorexia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and hypotension. His past medical history includes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, decompensated liver disease, and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is being treated with antibiotics and albumin. The patient's current condition includes hypothermia, hypernatremia, acute-on-chronic hepatic encephalopathy, hypermagnesemia, anemia, and pruritus. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis suggest a potential infection, possibly leading to sepsis. He is being treated empirically for SBP with antibiotics and albumin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, lung cancer surgery, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, hypotension, and signs of decompensated liver disease. The patient's temperature is slightly low, blood pressure is within normal range, heart rate is stable, and respiratory rate is normal. Oxygen saturation is good on a ventimask. Physical examination reveals jaundice, decreased breath sounds on the right side, minimal inspiratory rales posteriorly, and no evidence of inflammation in the left lower extremity.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and altered kidney function tests. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's sodium level has improved, but he still has hypernatremia. Other lab values indicate possible infection, coagulopathy, and worsening liver function.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypothermia with resolved leukocytosis: Concerning for sepsis. Treating for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and albumin. Vancomycin has been held due to supratherapeutic levels.
2. Hypoxia: Sudden change suggests possible aspiration from newly restarted tube feeds, pulmonary embolism due to liver disease, opening of patent foramen ovale, or pneumonia. Continuing oxygenation via ventimask and re"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, h/o Lung CA s/p lobectomy, presenting with hypoxia, hypotension, and hyperthermia. The patient was admitted to the MICU with UGI bleed and decompensated liver disease. He has been treated for suspected SBP with antibiotics and albumin. The patient's temperature has improved, but he remains hypothermic with Tmin 35.7. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient continues to receive ceftriaxone and Flagyl. Vancomycin levels are supratherapeutic, so it has been held until therapeutic levels are reached. The patient's hypoxia is thought to be due to aspiration, pneumonia, opening of PFO, or worsening liver failure. A chest X-ray has been ordered to further investigate this. The patient's hypotension responded well to fluids, and he received albumin and 1 unit PRBC during the past 24 hours. The patient has hypernatremia, which has improved following administration of D5W and free water flushes of Dobhoff. The patient's acute on chronic change in mental status is likely due to infection with worsening hepatic encephalopathy. The patient also has hypermagnesemia, anemia, and left lower extremity pain without evidence of clot or infection. The patient's care plan includes continuing lactulose, restarting rifaximin,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, lung cancer surgery, and recent anorexia. He was transferred to the MICU due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding and decompensated liver disease. The patient presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and hypothermia, suggesting sepsis. He was treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with antibiotics and albumin. The patient's hypoxia may be due to aspiration from tube feeds, pulmonary embolism, opening of patent foramen ovale, or pneumonia. His hypotension responded well to fluids, but further evaluation is needed. The patient also has hypernatremia, acute on chronic change in mental status, anorexia, increased liver function tests, and elevated bilirubin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypothermia, leukocytosis, and hypoxia suggest sepsis. He was already treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
2. Aspiration: The sudden change in hypoxia may be due to aspiration from newly restarted tube feeds.
3. Pulmonary embolism: This is another possible cause of hypoxia, especially considering the patient's recent surgery and immobilization.
4. Patent foramen ovale (PFO): The worsening liver failure could have led to the opening of a PFO, causing hypoxia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, lung cancer surgery, and recent transfer from another facility after an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been in the hospital for 24 days and is currently experiencing hypoxia, hypotension, and hypernatremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with antibiotics, suggesting an infection. Additionally, leukocytosis is present, which could be a sign of infection.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and worsening liver function tests indicate possible hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and worsening kidney function may suggest hepatorenal syndrome.

4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires careful fluid management and monitoring.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels despite fluid administration, indicating a need for further evaluation and treatment.

6. Acute on chronic change in mental status: The patient's decreased orientation over the past few days suggests a possible acute change in mental status, potentially due to infection or hepatic encephalopathy.

7. Anorexia: The patient's poor appetite and need for tube feeding indicate a potential nutritional issue.

   Assessment and Plan
   Complicated case of a 74-year-old man with progressive hepatic failure
   and end-stage liver disease, brought to the MICU for hypotension and
   hypoxemia, both of which have improved.  His mental status today is
   substantially better than yesterday.
   Hypoxemia
   Seems to have improved.
   Differential is broad and includes aspiration, PE (less likely), shunt
   (intracardiac or hepato-pulmonary).  Seems most likely related to
   aspiration given overall clinical course.
   Hypotension
   Some component appears to have been hypovolemic. [**Month (only) 60**] have low SVR in
   setting of ESLD as well. Sepsis is not fully excluded, and we have been
   treating empirically.
   Complete course for SBP and for presumptive aspiration pneumonia, then
   convert to SBP prophylaxis doses.
   Acute renal failure
   Resolved
   Mental Status
   Presumed encephalopathy and hypernatremia -- improved
   Anemia
   Likely mixed picture with some hemolysis, some blood loss, and some
   decreased production.
   Follow-up Coomb
s test.
   Follow Hct
   Hypernatremia
   Improving.  Repleting free water.
   Communication
   Family meetings with interpreter on a daily basis (and with patient if
   his mental status improves enough)
   Social work consult to help with family immigration issues
   Code Status
   DNR/DNI/no pressors.  Family believes patient would want no further
   painful procedures, but otherwise aggressive care to try to extend his
   survival until family arrives from [**Country 4952**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a complicated case of progressive hepatic failure and end-stage liver disease. He was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and hypoxemia, both of which have improved. The patient's mental status has also shown improvement today compared to yesterday.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient initially presented with hypoxemia, which seems to have improved. The differential diagnosis includes aspiration, pulmonary embolism (PE), and shunt (intracardiac or hepato-pulmonary). Aspiration is considered the most likely cause based on the overall clinical course.

2. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension, which appears to have some component of hypovolemia. There is a possibility of low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in the setting of end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Sepsis has not been fully excluded, and empirical treatment has been ongoing.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure, but it has since resolved.

4. Mental status changes: The patient presented with presumed encephalopathy and hypernatremia, which have both improved. 

5. Anemia: The patient likely has a mixed picture of anemia with hemolysis, blood loss, and decreased production. A Coomb test should be followed to investigate further.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient"
