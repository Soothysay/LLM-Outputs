","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a chief complaint of bowel perforation. She underwent an ERCP procedure, during which she suffered a perforation in her common bile duct or duodenum. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and pain management with morphine. She has been diagnosed with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) and her blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 99/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is expected to go to surgery this morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Due to bowel perforation, there is a risk of infection spreading into the bloodstream, leading to sepsis.
2. Kidney failure: The patient's stage V CKD indicates significant kidney damage, which could be further exacerbated by the recent episode of hypotension and inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's low respiratory rate and diminished breath sounds on physical examination, there is a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if she requires intubation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, indicating potential inadequate circulation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is admitted with a bowel perforation, likely in the common bile duct (CBD) or duodenum, which occurred during an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
- The patient is experiencing multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (stage V chronic kidney disease), respiratory distress, and hypotension.
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating possible infection.
- There is evidence of liver dysfunction, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes.
- The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and pain management with morphine.
- The patient is nil per os (NPO), meaning they are not allowed to eat or drink orally.
- The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all measures should be taken to save their life in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and signs of infection could lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Multi-organ failure: Due to the severity of the bowel perforation and associated complications, the patient may experience failure of multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis. The patient experienced a perforation of the viscus post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy. She underwent exploratory laparotomy, but no obvious site of perfusion was identified, and bile was found in the peritoneum. A post-pyloric gastric (G) tube was placed, and the patient remains intubated, now on levophed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection with elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactic acid levels, indicating possible sepsis due to the perforated viscus and bile in the peritoneum.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated pre-operatively, and there is a need to adjust the ventilator settings to correct metabolic acidosis and recheck arterial blood gases (ABG). This suggests respiratory failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient has low blood pressure readings, which may be due to sepsis/medications (propofol) and requires aggressive fluid resuscitation.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has worsening renal function indicated by increased creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis. The patient experienced a perforation and pneumoperitoneum post-ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction. 

Key events include:
- Multi-lumen central venous catheter placement
- CT abdomen showing free air
- Right subclavian line placement with a-line and LR fluids
- Emergent laparotomy, no obvious site of perforation identified but with 2 liters of bile in the abdomen
- Placement of post-pyloric gastric/jejunal (G/J) tube
- The patient remains intubated and on levophed

Medical history includes allergies to allopurinol and rash/abdominal reactions. The patient received antibiotics including metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

Vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia with a maximum temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F) and a current temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F). Blood pressure is 113/43 mmHg, heart rate is 120 bpm, respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3 mm"
