   Assessment and Plan
   68yo M squamous cell throat cancer w recent hx of pneumonia and ICU
   stay, s/p Trach/PEG, presented w tracheostomy tube in false lumen.
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Patient appears stable currently though had mild episode of
   desaturating in the evening and increase in FiO2, though pt does not
   complain of shortness of breath.
   - CXR to look at chest tube placement and pneumothorax
   - home nebulizers
   - complete course of vancomycin for previous MRSA pneumonia w today as
   last day
   - f/u w sputum cultures
 [**10-15**] sputum shows staph aureus
   - likely colonizes various bugs in sputum; hard to tell if infected by
   new staph infection
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated from when he was last discharged from hospital, but currently
   stable. In the setting of a new fever on presentation to the Medical
   ICU, he may have a new infection. Culture from [**10-14**] reads out Staph
   Aureus, which could mean that previous Vanc dosing had not been
   sufficient or that he had developed resistance or that he has another
   source of infection.  Pt has been on empiric C diff tx w metronidazole
   from Rehab center.  LLL infiltrate persists on CXR-- likely from
   pneumonia on previous admission.
   - re-cultured today w new fever
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum culture speciation and specificities
   from [**10-14**]
   - finish Vancomycin course, last dose today (for MRSA pneumonia from
   last hospitalization)
   - send C diff specimen if pt has diarrhea
   - continue metronidazole for now, pending C diff from [**Hospital1 189**] and
   here
call [**Hospital1 189**] about their C diff pending test results
   .
   # Tracheostomy Tube placement/Pneumothorax:
   Likely represents trauma from a trach change and suctioning as his
   rehabilitation facility.
   - monitor PTX w CXR
   - talk to surgeons about who pulls chest tube
   .
   # Anemia
   - guaiac stools
   - trend Hcts and transfuse for Hct <21
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:
   Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. s/p XRT and cetuximab, last
   dose [**2184-6-21**].  Surgery deferred.
   - G-tube in place
   - restart on tube feeds
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:
   Stable
   - continue on home lasix and beta blocker
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue on home meds of lisinopril, beta blocker
   .
   # H/O CVA:
   Per notes, he has had a history of 'small strokes'.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who has undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and subsequently underwent tracheostomy placement. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility but was readmitted due to bleeding from the tracheostomy and the presence of a false lumen. 

The patient's current condition includes fever, leukocytosis, a difficult airway with recurrent migration of the tracheostomy tube into the false lumen, pneumothorax, hyponatremia, anemia, and hypertension. The patient has been pan-cultured overnight and is awaiting results. 

The plan for the patient includes discontinuing vancomycin since it is ending its course, obtaining c.diff results and adding oral vancomycin if positive. A new tracheostomy has been placed by the intensivist, but the patient continues to have significant secretions and poor airway clearance. A CT scan is planned for the removal of pneumothorax, and a repeat chest X-ray will be done tomorrow morning. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. His sodium levels are low, and he requires transfusion of packed red blood cells. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature"

   - likely colonized difficult to discern infection vs. colonization,
   more likely colonization if no changes on CXR or in sputum production,
   will f/u final cx results
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated from when he was last discharged from hospital, now trending
   down. In the setting of a new fever on presentation to the Medical ICU,
   he may have a new infection. Sputum culture from [**10-14**] is growing Staph
   Aureus along with other oropharyngeal flora, which could mean that
   previous Vanc dosing had not been sufficient or that he had developed
   resistance, is colonized or that he has another source of infection.
   Pt has been on empiric C diff tx w metronidazole from Rehab center, but
   no C.diff results as  yet.  LLL infiltrate persists on CXR-- likely
   from pneumonia on previous admission.
   - If patient remains febrile with a persistent leukocytosis then would
   get a chest CT for better LLL characterization, also he continues to
   have some LLL collapse on CXR, that has improved but not resolved, may
   benefit from a clean out bronch, to help clear of all his secretions,
   and to help reinflate his LLL, if this is a post-obstructive PNA then
   will not clear well unless the obstruction is removed

   # Hyponatremia: patient has been on lasix 20mg po BID since admission,
   with lower tube feed rates, hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemic
   hyponatremia as patient appears dehydrated on exam

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, recent pneumonia, and ICU stay. He has undergone tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient presented with a tracheostomy tube in the false lumen and was diagnosed with a pneumothorax, which has since resolved. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory distress, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, anemia, stage III squamous cell throat cancer, chronic systolic heart failure, hypertension, and a history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident or stroke). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 114/48 to 156/70 mmHg, heart rate between 75-92 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and stable creatinine levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. 

The patient is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and an antibiotic regimen. 

The assessment and plan include addressing the patient's respiratory distress, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, anemia, and other ongoing medical conditions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include pneumonia due"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, recent pneumonia, and ICU stay. The patient underwent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement and presented with a tracheostomy tube in the false lumen. The patient is currently being treated in the Medical ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/48 mmHg to 156/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on tracheostomy mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tongue slightly protruding and very dry, a firm mass right jaw and superior neck, radiation changes anterior/right neck, tracheostomy, and gurgling sounds with breathing. The heart rhythm is regular without murmurs, and the lungs show diffuse rhonchorous sounds. The abdomen is soft and nondistended with a clean, dry, and intact PEG-tube site. The skin is warm and dry without rashes, and the extremities are warm without edema. The patient is alert and oriented with normal affect.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Blood cultures from October 14th to October 17th show growth of Staphylococcus"

   - secretions overall improved, S. aureus in sputum may be contaminant
   - could consider CT chest bronch with attempt to suction LLL and ensure
   no post-obstructive pneumonia
   - PICC was placed here 10.08, if can get peripheral access then will
   pull today
 Hyponatremia
   - previously thought to be due to HCTZ, hypovolemia and poor po intake
   - currently hypovolemic and poor solute intake
   - will hold lasix and advance tube feeds as tolerated
   - recheck lytes this afternoon
 Difficult Airway
   - tracheostomy with long limb placed on 10.16
   - per ENT, okay to restart aspirin today
 Pneumothorax
   - resolved on CXR with CT to water seal
   - surgery plans to pull CT today
 Anemia
   - likely anemia of chronic disease, crit bumped appropriately

   68yo M squamous cell throat cancer w recent hx of pneumonia and ICU
   stay, s/p Trach/PEG, presented w tracheostomy tube in false lumen.
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Patient appears stable with trach replaced, longer trach in place to
   bypass false lumen, ENT following.  Pneumothorax resolved on CXR
   Chest tube was pulled [**10-17**].  Completed course of Vancomycin for
   previous MRSA pneumonia.  Sputum growing MRSA pneumonia this admission
   as well, but may just be a colonization because also growing other
   bacteria.  Patient has significant lower airway secretions which may be
   contributing to mucus plugging as well.
   - repeat CXR today after chest tube pulled yesterday to make sure
   pneumothorax had resolved
   - continue home nebulizers
   - frequent suctioning
   - consider CT vs Bronch if pt acutely worsens w increasing fevers or
   respiratory distress , but hold off for now
   - if resp distress acutely worsens, consider bronch to clear out
   secretions
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Pt has had persistent leukocytosis that has worsened on this admission
   but trending down. He has had recent low grade temps, which may be
   concerning for new infection.  C diff negative, and sputum culture w
   MRSA (and other oropharyngeal flora) is likely a colonization.
   - If fever/leukocytosis acutely worsen, will chest CT for better
   - If acutely worsens, consider post-obstructive pneumonia and Bronch to
   to help clear of all his secretions, and to help reinflate his LLL
   - DC metronidazole b/c C diff negative and not having many BMs
   .
   # Hyponatremia:
   DCed diuretics, hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemic hyponatremia as
   patient appears dehydrated on exam

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, recent pneumonia, and ICU stay. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient presented with tracheostomy tube in the false lumen, and his pneumothorax has resolved on chest X-ray. The chest tube was removed on 10/17.

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin for previous MRSA pneumonia and metronidazole. His sputum is growing MRSA, but it may just be colonization because other bacteria are also present. The patient has significant lower airway secretions, which may contribute to mucus plugging.

The patient's leukocytosis has worsened on this admission but is trending down. He has had recent low-grade temperatures, which may be concerning for new infection. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is negative, and sputum culture with MRSA (and other oropharyngeal flora) is likely colonization.

The patient's sodium levels are low, likely due to hypovolemic hyponatremia as the patient appears dehydrated on examination. His anemia is stable, and there are no signs of bleeding. The patient's chronic systolic heart failure is stable, and his blood pressures are stable throughout the day. He is currently on home beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, recent pneumonia, and ICU stay. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient presented with a tracheostomy tube in the false lumen, which was replaced with a longer tracheostomy tube. His pneumothorax has resolved, and the chest tube was removed. The patient has completed a course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia but continues to have sputum growing MRSA, which may be colonization or infection. He has persistent leukocytosis with low-grade temperatures, indicating a possible new infection. The patient's sodium levels are low, and he is dehydrated. He is anemic but stable, and his respiratory distress has improved with tracheostomy replacement and suctioning. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, hypertension, depression, and previous small strokes. He is currently in the ICU for further evaluation of fevers and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheostomy-associated pneumonia: The patient's persistent leukocytosis and low-grade fever could be indicative of a new infection, potentially tracheostomy-associated pneumonia.
2. MRSA infection: The patient's sputum culture continues to grow MRSA, which may indicate ongoing colonization or a new infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo M squamous cell throat cancer w recent hx of pneumonia and ICU
   stay, s/p Trach/PEG, presented w tracheostomy tube in false lumen.
   # Respiratory Distress:
   if leukocytosis persists may benefit from a chest CT for further
   characterization of his LLL opacity, he may also benefit from a bronch
   to clear out all of his secretions. Patient appears stable with trach
   replaced, longer trach in place to bypass false lumen, ENT following.
   Pneumothorax resolved on CXR
 Chest tube was pulled [**10-17**].  Completed
   course of Vancomycin for previous MRSA pneumonia.  Sputum growing MRSA
   pneumonia this admission as well, but may just be a colonization
   because also growing other bacteria.  Patient has significant lower
   airway secretions which may be contributing to mucus plugging as well.
   - continue home nebulizers
   - frequent suctioning
   - consider CT vs Bronch
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated from when he was last discharged from hospital, now trending
   down. In the setting of a new fever on presentation to the Medical ICU,
   he may have a new infection. Sputum culture from [**10-14**] is growing MRSA
   along with other oropharyngeal flora
likely that MRSA is no colonized.
   Pt has been on empiric C diff tx w metronidazole from Rehab center, but
   C.diff results Negative so far.  LLL infiltrate persists on CXR--
   likely residual from pneumonia on previous admission.
   - If patient remains febrile with a persistent leukocytosis then would
   get a chest CT for better LLL characterization, also he continues to
   have some LLL collapse on CXR, that has improved but not resolved, may
   benefit from a clean out bronch, to help clear of all his secretions,
   and to help reinflate his LLL, if this is a post-obstructive PNA then
   will not clear well unless the obstruction is removed

   # Hyponatremia: patient has been on lasix 20mg po BID since admission,
   with lower tube feed rates, hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemic
   hyponatremia as patient appears dehydrated on exam
   - hold lasix for now, and look at old records to determine why he was

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, who has recently experienced pneumonia and an ICU stay. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient presented with a tracheostomy tube in the false lumen and showed signs of respiratory distress.

The assessment and plan include addressing several medical complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may benefit from a chest CT to further characterize the left lower lobe (LLL) opacity, as well as bronchoscopic clearance of secretions. A longer tracheostomy tube has been placed to bypass the false lumen, and the ENT team is following up.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is trending down but remains elevated. Given the new fever and the growth of MRSA in the sputum culture, there is a suspicion of a new infection. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's response to antibiotics and consider further investigations if the fever and leukocytosis persist.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to hypovolemic hyponatremia, possibly related to dehydration. It is recommended to hold Lasix and advance tube feeds to address this issue.

4. Anemia: The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, recent pneumonia, and ICU stay. He presented with a tracheostomy tube in the false lumen. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, anemia, and several other medical conditions. He is currently in the Medical ICU for further evaluation and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may benefit from a chest CT for further characterization of his left lower lobe (LLL) opacity. He may also benefit from a bronchoscopic clean-out to clear out all of his secretions.
2. Leukocytosis: Elevated white blood cell count, which is trending down. In the setting of a new fever, it may indicate a new infection. Sputum culture growing MRSA along with other oropharyngeal flora, likely colonization.
3. Hyponatremia: Patient has been on lasix, which may contribute to hyponatremia due to hypovolemic hyponatremia. Hold lasix and advance tube feeds.
4. Anemia: Patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an appropriate bump in hematocrit (HCT).
5. Stage III Squamous Cell Throat Cancer: Followed by Dr. [First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805]** at [Hospital1 19]**. s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**]. Surgery deferred.
6. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Stable on home beta blocker and ACEi.
7. Hypertension: Continue on home meds of lisinopril and beta blocker.
8. History of CVA: ASA 325mg daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo M squamous cell throat cancer w recent hx of pneumonia and ICU
   stay, s/p Trach/PEG, presented w tracheostomy tube in false lumen.
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Patient appears stable with trach replaced, longer trach in place to
   bypass false lumen, ENT following.  Pneumothorax resolved on CXR
   Chest tube was pulled [**10-17**].  Completed course of Vancomycin for
   previous MRSA pneumonia.  Sputum growing MRSA pneumonia this admission
   as well, but may just be a colonization because also growing other
   bacteria.  Patient has significant lower airway secretions which may be
   contributing to mucus plugging as well.
   - repeat CXR today after chest tube pulled yesterday to make sure
   pneumothorax had resolved
   - continue home nebulizers
   - frequent suctioning
   - consider CT vs Bronch if pt acutely worsens w increasing fevers or
   respiratory distress , but hold off for now
   - if resp distress acutely worsens, consider bronch to clear out
   secretions
   .
   # Leukocytosis: white count has remained stable over the past 24 hours,
   and Tmax=100.3 from yesterday, no further intervention in terms of
   bronch
   - If fever/leukocytosis acutely worsen, will chest CT for better
   imaging
   - If acutely worsens, consider post-obstructive pneumonia and Bronch to
   to help clear of all his secretions, and to help reinflate his LLL
   .
   # Hyponatremia: sodium increasing, tube feeds advancing to goal,
   holding all diuretics
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, no signs of bleeding
    -  cont to monitor Hct daily

   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:
   Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. s/p XRT and cetuximab, last
   dose [**2184-6-21**].  Surgery deferred.   Will have outpt. f/u
   - G-tube in place, escalating tube feeds to goal
trying bolus tube
   feeds today per nutrition recs
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Stable
   - continue on home beta blocker and ACEi
   .
   # Hypertension: BPs are higher in the morning, may benefit from taking
   the atenolol in the morning and lisinopril in the evening, can titrate
   up lisinopril if needed
   .
   # H/O CVA:
   Per notes, he has had a history of 'small strokes'.
   - ASA 325mg daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, recent pneumonia, and ICU stay. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient presented with a tracheostomy tube in the false lumen, but it has been replaced with a longer tracheostomy tube. He also had a pneumothorax that has resolved, and his chest tube was removed on 10/17. The patient is currently stable but has lower airway secretions contributing to mucus plugging. He is growing MRSA pneumonia this admission, but it may be colonization. His white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a mild fever. His sodium levels are improving, and tube feeds are being advanced to goal. He is anemic but stable with no signs of bleeding. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, hypertension, and CVA, and he is on appropriate medications for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress due to mucus plugging caused by lower airway secretions. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for bronchoscopic intervention.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of MRSA pneumonia and other bacteria in the sputum suggests the possibility of recurrent or worsening pneumonia. This could result in increased fever, leukocytosis, and respiratory distress"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, recent pneumonia, and an ICU stay. He presented with a tracheostomy tube in the false lumen and has since had the tracheostomy replaced, longer trach in place to bypass false lumen. The patient appears stable with the replacement trach, and his recent chest X-ray shows improvement in left lower lobe (LLL) collapse. A chest tube was previously placed but has since been removed.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory distress, leukocytosis with a stable white count over the past 24 hours, low-grade fever, and hyponatremia with increasing sodium levels. His anemia is stable, and there are no signs of bleeding. He also has stage III squamous cell throat cancer, chronic systolic heart failure, hypertension, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for mucus plugging due to significant lower airway secretions, which could potentially lead to further respiratory distress or pneumonia. The patient's hyponatremia needs to be closely monitored, as well as his heart failure and hypertension. Additionally, the patient's history of small strokes should be taken into consideration when managing his condition.

Overall, the patient's main concern is respiratory distress, which has improved with the replacement of the tracheostomy tube and the resolution of the pneumothorax."

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo M squamous cell throat cancer w recent hx of pneumonia and ICU
   stay, s/p Trach/PEG, presented w tracheostomy tube in false lumen.
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Patient appears stable with trach replaced, longer trach in place to
   bypass false lumen, ENT following.  Pneumothorax resolved on CXR
   Chest tube was pulled [**10-17**].  Completed course of Vancomycin for
   previous MRSA pneumonia.  Sputum growing MRSA pneumonia this admission
   as well, but may just be a colonization because also growing other
   bacteria.  Patient has significant lower airway secretions which may be
   contributing to mucus plugging as well.
   - repeat CXR today after chest tube pulled yesterday to make sure
   pneumothorax had resolved
   - continue home nebulizers
   - frequent suctioning
   - consider CT vs Bronch if pt acutely worsens w increasing fevers or
   respiratory distress , but hold off for now
   - if resp distress acutely worsens, consider bronch to clear out
   secretions
   .
   # Leukocytosis: white count has remained stable over the past 24 hours,
   but Tmax=100.3, may need a further intervention (CT or bronch) or add
   linezolid for MRSA coverage, since he has recently completed a course
   of vancomycin
   Pt has had persistent leukocytosis that has worsened on this admission
   but trending down. He has had recent low grade temps, which may be
   concerning for new infection.  C diff negative, and sputum culture w
   MRSA (and other oropharyngeal flora) is likely a colonization.
   - If fever/leukocytosis acutely worsen, will chest CT for better
   imaging
   - If acutely worsens, consider post-obstructive pneumonia and Bronch to
   to help clear of all his secretions, and to help reinflate his LLL
   .
   # Hyponatremia: DC
d diuretics, hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemic
   hyponatremia as patient appears dehydrated on exam.  He also had not
   been receiving tube feeds due to his multiple procedures for trach
   manipulation
   - f/u urine lytes, osms
   - hold lasix
   - advance tube feeds per nutrition recs
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, no signs of bleeding
    -  cont to monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:
   Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. s/p XRT and cetuximab, last
   dose [**2184-6-21**].  Surgery deferred.   Will have outpt. f/u
   - G-tube in place, escalating tube feeds to goal
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Stable
   - continue on home beta blocker and ACEi
   .
   # Hypertension: BPs are Stable throughout day
   - continue on home meds of lisinopril, beta blocker, separated w some
   meds in day and some at night
   .
   # Depression
   Pt frustrated to be in hospital again after prolonged previous stay.
   - cont to monitor mood/affect and consider adding anti-depressant
   .
   # H/O CVA:
   Per notes, he has had a history of 'small strokes'.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell throat cancer, recent pneumonia, and ICU stay. He has undergone tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory distress, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, anemia, stage III squamous cell throat cancer, chronic systolic heart failure, hypertension, and depression.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature (Tmax: 37.9°C), blood pressure ranging from 152/61 mmHg to 168/71 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on tracheostomy.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (Na: 134 mg/dL) and hyperkalemia (K: 5.2 mEq/L). The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating between 113 mg/dL and 154 mg/dL.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and an anticoagulant (SQ Heparin) for deep vein thrombosis ("
