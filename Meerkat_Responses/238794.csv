   Assessment and Plan
   74 M with dialated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement admitted for
   hypotension in setting of amiodorone loading for VT.
   .
   VENTRICULAR ARRYTHMIA:  Likely VT, but also could represent a-fib with
   abarency.
   Etiology:
   -          ? fluid overload -> diuresing (neg 1.4 L)
          -      ? Infection given leukocytosis (although on prednisone),
   and development of mild fever, tachypnea and productive cough. ->
   started on Levaquin, pancultured, CXR unchanged
          -      ? ischemia  - enzymes neg
          -      ? PE unlikely given theraputic INR, but patient does have
   history.
   - beta blocker and amiodorone to suppress ectopic ventricular source
   - EP consult
   - restart coumadin if INR < 3
   .
   Systolic CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Continues to be fluid overloaded
   but diuresing well.
   .
   HYPERTENSION: on Cozaar and Metoprolol
   .
   COPD: Does not appear to be in acute flair
   - Albuterol/ipratroprium, advair

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and an implanted automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). He was admitted for hypotension while being loaded with amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

In the evening, the patient felt unwell and described an inability to slow down his breathing. He appeared tremulous, flushed, warm, and generally uncomfortable. His vital signs were stable, and the chest X-ray was unchanged. The patient had an increased productive cough and was started on Levaquin, which was pancultured. He also received a dose of Furosemide (Lasix) at 08:00 PM. 

The next morning, the patient did not remember the events of the previous night. His respiratory support included an oxygen delivery device via nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 95%. 

Physical examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. He had an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), normal heart sounds with a 1-2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border (LLSB) without radiation. Diffuse wheezing and scattered crackles were heard in the lungs. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds were present. No femoral bruits were detected, and the extremities showed no club"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted for hypotension while receiving amiodarone loading for VT. The patient has been diagnosed with ventricular arrhythmia, likely VT, and other potential causes such as infection, ischemia, or pulmonary embolism have been ruled out. The patient is also experiencing congestive heart failure, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and COPD.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Ventricular Arrhythmia: The patient is at risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening events.

2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's systolic congestive heart failure may worsen if fluid overload is not effectively managed with diuretics.

3. Hypertension: If the patient's hypertension is not adequately controlled, it can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function needs close monitoring to prevent further deterioration and the associated complications, such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and mild fever suggests a potential infection, which should be promptly identified and treated to prevent complications.

6. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's history of COPD puts him at risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted for hypotension while receiving amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has been experiencing transient blood pressures in the 70s, intermittent native ventricular beats, and diffuse wheezing with scattered crackles throughout the lungs. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.2°F (39.6°C), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 63/40 mmHg to 81/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24200 cells/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.02 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with ventricular arrhythmia, likely VT, and possible infection, given the fever, leukocytosis, and productive cough. The source of infection is suspected to be pulmonary. 

The patient's fluid overload has been managed with diuretics, and there are no recent episodes of VT. The patient's hypertension is being treated with Cozaar and metoprolol. 

Renal function has worsened, as indicated by the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted for hypotension while undergoing amiodarone loading for VT. The patient has experienced ventricular arrhythmia, likely due to volume overload and infection. The patient has been diuresed with 2.2 L of Lasix and is currently on beta-blockers and amiodarone to suppress ectopic ventricular sources. 

The patient also has signs of infection, including leukocytosis, fever, tachypnea, and productive cough, suggesting a pulmonary source. The patient has a small wound on their leg but it does not appear to be a likely source of infection. Antibiotics have been started, and a sputum culture is pending.

Additionally, the patient continues to exhibit signs of systolic congestive heart failure with fluid overload, but is responding well to diuretics. The patient's hypertension is being managed with Cozaar and metoprolol.

There are no acute exacerbations of COPD, and the patient's renal function is worsening, with a creatinine level of 1.7. The patient is being closely monitored and managed accordingly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted for hypotension while receiving amiodarone loading for ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has undergone an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. 

On the flow sheet, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.2°F, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/66 to 111/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing and scattered crackles throughout the lungs, a soft abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness, and no femoral bruits. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.5-13.6 thousand/mm³, elevated hemoglobin levels of 36.5-38.1%, and slightly elevated platelet count of 261-242 thousand/mm³. Renal function tests indicate worsening renal function with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and plan:
1. Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient likely experienced VT, but no recent episodes have been observed. Causes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who has been admitted to the ICU for hypotension while on amiodarone loading for ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient's recent events include elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which led to discontinuation of amiodarone. The plan is to wash out the medication and consider dofetilide or ablation per electrophysiology (EP) study. The patient has experienced several short runs of VT but did not require lidocaine. He is currently on Levaquin, a medication that can cause QT prolongation.

The patient has allergies to Bactrim, vancomycin, and ambien. His last doses of antibiotics were Levofloxacin on 11/11 at 12:45 PM and vancomycin on 11/12 at 11:59 PM. The patient is receiving continuous infusions of furosemide (Lasix) at 3 mg/hr and other ICU medications.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but his blood pressure is low. His heart rate is stable, respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is good. The patient's rhythm is ventricular paced.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,331 mL and output of 2,385 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,054"
