   Progressive neurologic decline
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of neurological
   deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive presents with
   increasing shortness of breath.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient developed hypercarbic respiratory
   failure yesterday evening secondary to weakness of respiratory
   muscles.  Cause is being worked up as below.  Also she may have an
   aspiration pneumonia contributing.  Major barrier to extubation is her
   neuromuscular weakness.  The course of this is most likely
   irreversible, but will need to complete work-up for  the underlying
   cause prior to discussing with family the options for tracheostomy vs
   extubation if the prognosis does not portend recovery.
   - continue ampicillin-sulbactam for likely aspiration PNA; will plan
   for 7-day course (day 1=[**4-28**])
   - discuss with neurology her prognosis from a neurologic standpoint
   - discuss with her family what her wishes would be going forward
   .
   #) Neurologic deterioration:  Yesterday, the team spoke to her
   neurologist about the work-up that has been done thus far.  She has had
   2 negative LPs and serial MRIs (6 months apart) that were not
   significantly different.  EMG has not yet been done.  MRI reports were
   obtained and are in the chart, suggestive of microvascular ischemic
   injury.
    This was recently evaluated at [**Hospital1 **] without any conclusion as to
   the cause.  She has a leukoencephalopathy. Infectious etiology such as
   PML is possible, although no known immunosuppressive risk factors and
   she was recently HIV negative per discharge summary from [**Hospital1 **].
   Neurology service has been consulted and will see her today.
   - LP has been negative x 2
   - spoke with her neurologist
   - daughter needs to get CD of MRI from OSH
   - neurology needs to weigh in on the irreversibility of this
   - f/u neurology recs
   - obtain results of outstanding studies from the time of discharge

   .
   #) Gram positive cocci in blood:  likely contaminant given
 bottles
   positive.  Currently on vancomycin.
   .
   #) Hypokalemia:  likely secondary to metabolic alkalosis causing
   potassium to flow into cells after recent acidosis (which caused
   articficially
   .
   #) Dysphagia:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  No need for a
   speech and swallow evaluation given obvious history of aspiration
   events.
   - strict NPO
   - address PEG vs NG tube in goals of care discussion with her daughter
   .
   #) Tachycardia: She is likely still volume depleted but may be
   tachycardic at baseline as well.
   -  1L IVNS now
   -  monitor for signs of volume overload
   .
   #) Fever:  Febrile to 100.7 in the ED, WBC now rising, suspicious for
   aspiration PNA as above.
   - ampicillin-sulbactam as above
   - PR tylenol PRN
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   .
   #) Hypertension:  On amlodipine and HCTZ at home.  Currently
   normotensive.
   - continue to hold all PO medicatiosn out of concern for
   currently normotensive.  Prefer to avoid all PO meds, including home
   amlodipine and HCTZ.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presented with increasing shortness of breath and developed hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a fever (Tmax: 38.1 C), tachycardia (HR: 103 bpm), hypotension (BP: 98/62 mmHg), and tachypnea (RR: 15 breaths/min). The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST mode ventilation.

The patient has dry mucous membranes, chafed and bleeding lips, supple neck, regular heart sounds, using accessory muscles for respiration, grunting with each expiration, clear lungs bilaterally with decreased sounds at bases, scaphoid abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds, nontender back, no cyanosis or edema, and strong distal pulses. Neurologically, the patient is sedated and does not arouse to voice.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, slightly low platelet count of 216 K/uL, normal glucose level of 81 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 0"

   Progressive neurologic decline
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of neurological
   deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive presents with
   increasing shortness of breath.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  CXR this
   morning, history, and rising WBC are also concerning for aspiration
   pneumonia.  Her underlying neurologic disorder is likely to continue to
   progress, and thus her respiratory status will probably continue to
   decline.
   - start ampicillin-sulbactam for likely aspiration PNA; will plan for
   7-day course (day 1=[**4-28**])
   - discuss with neurology her prognosis from a neurologic standpoint
   - discuss with her family what her wishes would be with regard to
   invasive management given likely very poor prognosis
   .
   #) Neurologic deterioration: This was recently evaluated at [**Hospital1 **]
   without any conclusion as to the cause.  She has a leukoencephalopathy.
   Infectious etiology such as PML is possible, although no known
   immunosuppressive risk factors and she was recently HIV negative per
   discharge summary from [**Hospital1 **].  Neurology service has been consulted
   and will see her today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presents with increasing shortness of breath and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure secondary to neuromuscular weakness. There are also concerns for aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the rising white blood cell count and the presence of group A streptococcus in the blood culture.

The patient's underlying neurological disorder is likely to continue progressing, which will likely lead to further decline in her respiratory status. As a result, she has been started on ampicillin-sulbactam for likely aspiration pneumonia, and her prognosis from a neurological standpoint will be discussed with the neurology service.

The patient is also experiencing neurologic deterioration, with a recent evaluation at another hospital concluding without any definitive cause. A leukoencephalopathy has been identified, and an infectious etiology such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is possible. The neurology service has been consulted, and follow-up recommendations will be provided.

Other issues noted in the progress note include bacteremia, dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness, tachycardia, fever, and hypertension. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU pending above.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening neurologic decline, complications from aspiration pneumonia, and further deterioration in overall health status"

   Progressive neurologic decline
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of neurological
   deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive presents with
   increasing shortness of breath.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: secondary to
    Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  CXR this morning, history, and
   rising WBC are also concerning for aspiration pneumonia.  Her
   underlying neurologic disorder is likely to continue to progress, and
   thus her respiratory status will probably continue to decline.
   - start ampicillin-sulbactam for likely aspiration PNA; will plan for
   7-day course (day 1=[**4-28**])
   - discuss with neurology her prognosis from a neurologic standpoint
   - discuss with her family what her wishes would be with regard to
   invasive management given likely very poor prognosis
   .
   #) Neurologic deterioration: This was recently evaluated at [**Hospital1 **]
   without any conclusion as to the cause.  She has a leukoencephalopathy.
   Infectious etiology such as PML is possible, although no known
   immunosuppressive risk factors and she was recently HIV negative per
   discharge summary from [**Hospital1 **].  Neurology service has been consulted
   and will see her today.
   - LP has been negative x 2
   - spoke with her neurologist
   - daughter needs to get CD of MRI from OSH
   - neurology needs to weigh in on the irreversibility of this
   - f/u neurology recs
   - obtain results of outstanding studies from the time of discharge

   positive.  Currently on vancomycin.
   .
   #) Hypokalemia:  likely secondary to metabolic alkalosis causing
   potassium to flow into cells after recent acidosis (which caused
   articficially
   .
   #) Dysphagia:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  No need for a
   speech and swallow evaluation given obvious history of aspiration
   events.
   - strict NPO
   - address PEG vs NG tube in goals of care discussion with her daughter
   .
   #) Tachycardia: She is likely still volume depleted but may be
   tachycardic at baseline as well.
   -  1L IVNS now
   -  monitor for signs of volume overload

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presented with increasing shortness of breath and was intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure. An arterial line was placed, and she developed metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia/hypophosphatemia. The patient also has a positive Gram-positive cocci in her blood culture, likely a contaminant, and is currently on vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/62 to 93/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her neurological status is described as awake and alert, nonverbal but follows one-step commands.

The patient has a leukoencephalopathy and recent negative lumbar punctures. She is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia, and her respiratory status is expected to decline due to her underlying neurological disorder. The neurology service has been consulted, and further evaluation of her neurological condition is planned.

The patient's other medical issues include dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness, tachycardia possibly due to volume depletion or baseline tachycardia, fever with rising WBC count,"

   Progressive neurologic decline
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of neurological
   deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive presents with
   increasing shortness of breath.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient developed hypercarbic respiratory
   failure yesterday evening secondary to weakness of respiratory
   muscles.  Cause is being worked up as below.  Also she may have an
   aspiration pneumonia contributing.  Major barrier to extubation is her
   neuromuscular weakness.  The course of this is most likely
   irreversible, but will need to complete work-up for  the underlying
   cause prior to discussing with family the options for tracheostomy vs
   extubation if the prognosis does not portend recovery.
   - continue ampicillin-sulbactam for likely aspiration PNA; will plan
   for 7-day course (day 1=[**4-28**])
   - discuss with neurology her prognosis from a neurologic standpoint
   - discuss with her family what her wishes would be going forward
   .
   #) Neurologic deterioration:  Yesterday, the team spoke to her
   neurologist about the work-up that has been done thus far.  She has had
   2 negative LPs and serial MRIs (6 months apart) that were not
   significantly different.  EMG has not yet been done.  MRI reports were
   obtained and are in the chart, suggestive of microvascular ischemic
   injury.  It may be possible that she does not have a leukodystrophy but
   instead two separate processes (ischemic changes in the brain and a
   peripheral neuropathy of some sort causing the weakness).  Our own
   neurology team will see her today and offer recommendations
   - repeat MRI; discuss with neuro what sequences they would like
   - discuss with neuro if there is any chance of a reversible component
   - encourage her daughter to try to get the actual images from her OSH
   (which would be helpful for neuro to use as comparison)
   .
   #) Gram positive cocci in blood:  likely contaminant given
 bottles
   positive.
   - start vancomycin pending speciation; will stop if coag negative,
   await sensitivities if SA
   - contact precautions
   .
   #) Refeeding syndrome:  In the context of virtually no PO intake x days
   and much decreased intake x months, tubefeeds were begun yesterday.
   She then developed severe hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia.
   - replete electrolytes
   - hold tube feeds until electrolytes are normalized
   .
   #) Metabolic alkalosis:  Contributions from recently corrected
   respiratory acidosis as well as secondary to the hypophosphatemia.
   - correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Dysphagia:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  No need for a
   speech and swallow evaluation given obvious history of aspiration
   events.
   - strict NPO
   - address PEG vs NG tube in goals of care discussion with her daughter
   .
   #) Tachycardia: She is likely still volume depleted but may be
   tachycardic at baseline as well.
   -  1L IVNS now
   -  monitor for signs of volume overload
   .
   #) Fever:  Febrile to 100.7 in the ED, WBC now rising, suspicious for
   aspiration PNA as above.
   - ampicillin-sulbactam as above
   - PR tylenol PRN
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   .
   #) Hypertension:  On amlodipine and HCTZ at home.  Currently
   normotensive.
   - continue to hold all PO medicatiosn out of concern for
   currently normotensive.  Prefer to avoid all PO meds, including home
   amlodipine and HCTZ.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive.
- She presented with increasing shortness of breath and developed hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation.
- An arterial line was started on the evening of April 28th.
- Blood cultures were obtained, and vancomycin was added due to gram-positive cocci in the blood, which is likely a contaminant.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- The patient has metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia/hypophosphatemia, and possible refeeding syndrome.
- She also has dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness, tachycardia, fever, and hypertension.
- The patient's family was discussed regarding her prognosis and goals of care.
- The patient is currently on tube feeds, and electrolytes need to be repleted.
- She is on prophylactic heparin sodium and strict NPO status.
- The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU pending above.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory muscles are weak, making it difficult to breathe without assistance. If the underlying cause is not addressed, she may continue to experience"

- The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive.
- She presented with increasing shortness of breath and was intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- The patient developed metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia after starting tube feeds.
- She has gram-positive cocci in her blood culture, likely a contaminant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory muscles are weak, making it difficult to breathe on her own. This may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to the patient's dysphagia and neuromuscular weakness, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Neurological Deterioration: The patient's neurological condition is worsening, as indicated by progressive neurologic decline and microvascular ischemic changes in the brain.

   Progressive neurologic decline
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of neurological
   deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive presents with
   increasing shortness of breath, likely recent aspiration events, now
   with evidence of PNA.
   .
   #) Pneumonia:  Retrocardiac and LLL PNA blossoming on CXR.  Fever curve
   trending up.   Sputum with GNR.  Started ampicillin-sulbactam
   yesterday, but given GNR this will need to be changed to pip-tazo.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - start pip-tazo
   - d/c amp-sulbac
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   weakness of respiratory muscles.  Cause is being worked up as below.
   Pneumonia is also contributing.   We will need to discuss with family
   tracheostomy vs extubation if the neurologic prognosis does not portend
   recovery.
   - continue treating PNA as above
   - discuss with neurology her prognosis from a neurologic standpoint
   - discuss with her family what her wishes would be going forward
   #) Neurologic deterioration:  Unknown cause.   s/p LP yesterday that
   was without infectious/inflammatory evidence, MRIs have been obtained
   from OSH and do not show anything that would cause this (per discussion
   with neurology).   No need to repeat MRI now, per neurology.
   - discuss with neuro the current differential
   - try to plan family meeting with family, primary team, and neurology
   to discuss prognosis and what this means about goals of care going
   warward.
   .
   #) Gram positive cocci in blood:  coag negative staph in
 bottles
   - d/c vanc
   - d/c contact precautions.
   .
   #) Refeeding syndrome:  Hypophos and hypokalemia in the context of TF,
   now corrected.
   - restart TF slowly
   - frequent electrolyte checks and repeat PRN
   .
   #) Dysphagia:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  No need for a
   speech and swallow evaluation given obvious history of aspiration
   events.
   - strict NPO
   - NG tube feeds (holding pending electrolyte repletion)
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  seems to be baseline
   ...
   #) Hypertension:  On amlodipine and HCTZ at home.  Currently
   normotensive.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presents with increasing shortness of breath, likely recent aspiration events, and evidence of pneumonia (PNA). The patient has respiratory failure secondary to weakness of respiratory muscles, and pneumonia is contributing to this condition. There is also neurologic deterioration of unknown cause.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of PNA with a fever curve trending up and sputum showing GNR bacteria. This indicates a bacterial infection in the lungs, which requires prompt treatment.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure due to weakness of respiratory muscles. This condition may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed.

3. Neurologic deterioration: The cause of the patient's neurologic decline is unknown. Further investigation and discussion with neurology are necessary to determine the cause and plan appropriate management.

4. Refeeding syndrome: The patient has hypophos (low phosphate) and hypokalemia in the context of total parenteral nutrition (TF). These electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected, and TF should be restarted slowly with frequent electrolyte checks.

5. Dysphagia: The patient has secondary neuromuscular weakness leading to dysphagia. This condition requires strict NPO (nothing by mouth) status and NG (nasogastric) tube feeds.

6. Tachycardia: The patient has a baseline tachycardia, which should be monitored and addressed accordingly.

7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but currently, she is normotensive. Blood pressure management will depend on her current condition.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided progress note. It is important to address each of these complications appropriately to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Progressive neurologic decline
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of neurological
   deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive presents with
   increasing shortness of breath.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient developed hypercarbic respiratory
   failure yesterday evening secondary to weakness of respiratory
   muscles.  Cause is being worked up as below.  Also she may have an
   aspiration pneumonia contributing.  Major barrier to extubation is her
   neuromuscular weakness.  The course of this is most likely
   irreversible, but will need to complete work-up for  the underlying
   cause prior to discussing with family the options for tracheostomy vs
   extubation if the prognosis does not portend recovery.
   - continue ampicillin-sulbactam for likely aspiration PNA; will plan
   for 7-day course (day 1=[**4-28**])
   - discuss with neurology her prognosis from a neurologic standpoint
   - discuss with her family what her wishes would be going forward
   .
   #) Fever and leukocytosis:  concerning for an infectious process.
   Fever curve is going up and WBC rising despite Unasyn/vanc.  GNR in
   sputum
   - broaden antibiotics to zosyn
   #) Neurologic deterioration:  Yesterday, the team spoke to her
   neurologist about the work-up that has been done thus far.  She has had
   2 negative LPs and serial MRIs (6 months apart) that were not
   significantly different.  EMG has not yet been done.  MRI reports were
   obtained and are in the chart, suggestive of microvascular ischemic
   injury.  It may be possible that she does not have a leukodystrophy but
   instead two separate processes (ischemic changes in the brain and a
   peripheral neuropathy of some sort causing the weakness).  Our own
   neurology team will see her today and offer recommendations
   - repeat MRI; discuss with neuro what sequences they would like
   - discuss with neuro if there is any chance of a reversible component
   - encourage her daughter to try to get the actual images from her OSH
   (which would be helpful for neuro to use as comparison)
   .
   #) Gram positive cocci in blood:  coag negative staph
   - d/c vanc
   - start vancomycin pending speciation; will stop if coag negative,
   await sensitivities if SA
   - contact precautions
   .
   #) Refeeding syndrome:  In the context of virtually no PO intake x days
   and much decreased intake x months, tubefeeds were begun yesterday.
   She then developed severe hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia.   This is
   consistent with refeeding.
   - replete electrolytes
   - hold tube feeds until electrolytes are normalized
   .
   #) Metabolic alkalosis:  Contributions from a compensatory alkalosis
   for a recently corrected respiratory acidosis as well as secondary to
   the hypophosphatemia.
   - correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Dysphagia:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  No need for a
   speech and swallow evaluation given obvious history of aspiration
   events.
   - strict NPO
   - NG tube feeds (holding pending electrolyte repletion)
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  likely still has some degree of volume depletion
   contributing
   - 1L NS bolus
   ..
   #) Hypertension:  On amlodipine and HCTZ at home.  Currently
   normotensive.
   - no meds for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presents with increasing shortness of breath and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to weakness of respiratory muscles. She also has fever, leukocytosis, and an infection in her sputum. The patient's neurologic condition is worsening, and further work-up is needed to determine the underlying cause. She has metabolic alkalosis, hypophosphatemia, dysphagia, tachycardia, hypertension, and refeeding syndrome. She is currently intubated and sedated, with tube feeds held pending electrolyte repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has acute respiratory failure, which is likely irreversible. This could lead to further deterioration in her respiratory function and potentially result in death if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, indicating an infectious process. If not treated promptly and effectively, the infection could worsen, leading to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Neurologic Deterioration: The patient's neurological condition is progressively declining, and the cause needs to be determined. If the underlying cause is not identified and treated, the neurologic deterioration may continue, leading to significant disability or death.
4. Metabolic Imbalances: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, hypophosphatemia, and other electroly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presents with increasing shortness of breath, recent aspiration events, and evidence of pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 94/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her review of systems shows no significant changes except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure secondary to weakness of respiratory muscles. Pneumonia is also contributing to her respiratory distress. Tracheostomy versus extubation should be discussed with the family considering the neurologic prognosis.

2. Neurologic Deterioration: The cause of the patient's neurologic deterioration is unknown despite extensive work-up including LP and MRI. Alzheimer's disease is being considered as a possible cause. Palliative care will be consulted to address end-of-life decisions.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. Further sputum cultures are needed to guide the treatment.

4. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness. She is currently NPO and receiving tube feeds through a nasogastric (NG) tube.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presents with increasing shortness of breath, likely recent aspiration events, and evidence of pneumonia.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to weakness of respiratory muscles. Pneumonia is also contributing to her respiratory failure. The cause is being worked up, and the decision of tracheostomy versus extubation needs to be discussed with the family.

2. Neurologic Deterioration: The patient has an unknown cause of neurologic deterioration. Lumbar puncture, MRI, and further extensive work-up have been negative. The differential diagnosis includes prior disease versus early Alzheimer's. Neurology has spoken with the family about the grim prognosis, and they would like to proceed with aggressive measures.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient is experiencing metabolic alkalosis, as indicated by an elevated TCO2 level.

4. Hypophosphatemia (Low Phosphate): The patient is showing signs of hypophosphatemia, which can be related to refeeding syndrome.

5. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness. She has had obvious history of aspiration events.

6. Tachycardia: The patient has a baseline tachycardia.

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of neurological
   deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive presents with
   increasing shortness of breath, likely recent aspiration events, now
   with evidence of PNA.
   .
   #) Pneumonia:  On pip-tazo yesterday for retrocardiac and LLL PNA
   blossoming on CXR.  Sputum with non-speciated GNRs.  Still febrile.
   WBC slightly improved today
   - f/u sputum cx
   - cont pip/tazo
   - repeat CXR
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   weakness of respiratory muscles.  Cause is being worked up as below.
   Pneumonia is also contributing.   We will need to discuss with family
   tracheostomy vs extubation given that neuro has basically concluded
   that there is little chance of recovery.  IP was alerted about possible
   trach/PEG next week.
   - continue treating PNA as above
   - palliative care will see her Monday
   .
   #) Neurologic deterioration:  Unknown cause.   LP, MRI, and further
   extensive work-up have been negative.  Differential per neuro is
   primarily prior disease vs early Alzheimers.  Neurology has spoken with
   her family about the grim prognosis.  They would like to go forward
   with aggressive measures.
   - EEG today (unlikely to be revealing, but for the sake of
   completeness)
   - palliative care will see her Monday
   .
   #) Gram positive cocci in blood:  coag negative staph in
 bottles.
   Likely contaminant.  Off vancomycin.
   .
   #) Refeeding syndrome:  Hypophos and hypokalemia in the context of TF,
   now corrected.  TF restarted yesterday.
   - restart TF slowly
   - frequent electrolyte checks and repeat PRN
   .
   #) Dysphagia:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  No need for a
   speech and swallow evaluation given obvious history of aspiration
   events.
   - strict NPO
   - NG tube feeds (holding pending electrolyte repletion)
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  seems to be baseline
   ...
   #) Hypertension:  On amlodipine and HCTZ at home.  Currently
   normotensive.
   - no meds for now

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive.
- She presents with increasing shortness of breath, likely recent aspiration events, and evidence of pneumonia.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- She has a history of neurological decline, with an unknown cause despite extensive work-up including LP and MRI.
- The patient's family is aware of the grim prognosis but wishes to pursue aggressive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to weakness of respiratory muscles. Pneumonia is contributing to the respiratory failure as well.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which requires treatment with antibiotics such as pip-tazo.
3. Neurologic Deterioration: The cause of the patient's neurologic deterioration remains unknown despite negative LP and MRI results. Further evaluation is necessary.
4. Refeeding Syndrome: The patient is at risk for refeeding syndrome due to the recent initiation of tube feeds. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia, should be closely monitored and managed.
5. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness, leading to aspiration events."

   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of neurological
   deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive presents with
   increasing shortness of breath, likely recent aspiration events, now
   with evidence of PNA.
   .
   #) Pneumonia:  On pip-tazo for retrocardiac and LLL PNA blossoming on
   CXR.  Sputum with non-speciated GNRs on gram stain which have not yet
   grwon in culture.  Still with low grade fevers.  WBC improving slowly.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - cont pip/tazo
   - repeat CXR
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   weakness of respiratory muscles further decompensated by overlying
   PNA.   Neuro giving grim prognosis although diagnosis unclear at this
   point.  Family wishes to pursue trach and PEG.
   - continue treating PNA as above
   - palliative care will see her Monday
   - IP aware and will pursue trach/peg on tues v wed.
   .
   #) Neurologic deterioration:  Unknown cause.   LP, MRI, and further
   extensive work-up have been negative.  Differential per neuro is
   primarily prior disease vs early Alzheimers.  Neurology has spoken with
   her family about the grim prognosis.  They would like to go forward
   with aggressive measures as above
   - f/u EEG

   #) Gram positive cocci bacterimia?:  coag negative staph in 1 of 4
   bottles.   Likely contaminant.  Off vancomycin.
   .
   #) Refeeding syndrome:  Hypophos and hypokalemia in the context of TF,
   now corrected s/p aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - frequent electrolyte checks ([**Hospital1 **]) and repeat PRN
   - continue tube feeds
   .
   #) Dysphagia:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  No need for a
   speech and swallow evaluation given obvious history of aspiration
   events.
   - strict NPO
   - NG tube feeds

","The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presents with increasing shortness of breath, likely recent aspiration events, and now with evidence of pneumonia. 

Medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of PNA (pneumonia) and hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to weakness of respiratory muscles. This can worsen the patient's respiratory status.
2. Neurologic deterioration: The cause of the patient's neurologic deterioration is unknown, and further work-up has been negative. This may lead to progressive neurologic decline.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient has delirium/confusion, which may be due to her underlying medical conditions or medication side effects.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is likely community-acquired. This needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics.
5. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness. This increases the risk of aspiration events and potential aspiration pneumonia.
6. Constipation: The patient has constipation (obstipation, fos), which is common in critically ill patients due to decreased mobility and medication use.
7. Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate): The patient has low phosphate levels, which can occur in critically ill patients due to refeeding syndrome or other factors.
8. Metabolic alkalosis:"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (HR: 100 bpm), hypotension (BP: 97/58 mmHg), and an elevated respiratory rate (RR: 22 breaths/min). The patient also has a low oxygen saturation level (SpO2: 91%).

The patient has been diagnosed with several problems, including progressive neurologic decline, metabolic alkalosis, hypophosphatemia, dysphagia, acute respiratory failure, constipation, bacterial pneumonia, delirium/confusion, and others.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, fluids, and medications for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding.

Imaging studies have shown a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, which could indicate a lung infection or fluid accumulation. The microbiology results indicate the presence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and no organisms in the sputum culture.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), nosocomial infections due to prolonged ICU stay, and complications related to the patient's underlying conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of neurological deterioration, right arm weakness, and failure to thrive. She presents with increasing shortness of breath and evidence of pneumonia. She has been on antibiotics for a retrocardiac and left lower lobe pneumonia. Her white blood cell count is improving slowly. The patient also has respiratory failure, which is secondary to weakness of respiratory muscles exacerbated by the underlying pneumonia. The family wishes to pursue tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The cause of her neurological deterioration is unknown, and further work-up has been negative. The patient has been diagnosed with metabolic alkalosis, hypophosphatemia, dysphagia, acute respiratory failure, constipation, bacterial pneumonia, delirium, and confusion. She has been treated for these conditions and is currently being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis if not treated effectively.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if her respiratory muscles continue to weaken, leading to increased difficulty in breathing and potential ventilator dependence.

3. Neurological Deterioration: The cause of the patient's neurological decline is still unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. If the neurological condition worsens, it could impact her overall prognosis and quality of life.

   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of progressive neurological
   deterioration irst with cognitive symptoms, then progressive aphasia,
   diffculty swallowing/ aspiration, skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy;
   intubated for increased work of breathing and progressive hypercarbia
   in setting of aspiration PNA overlying her neurologically driven
   weakness.  Grim prognosis from neuro despite lack of diagnosis.
   #) Pneumonia:  On pip-tazo for retrocardiac and LLL PNA;  now worsening
   on CXR as lingula seems to be newly involved; CXR progression could
   also be new atelectasis.  Sputum with non-speciated GNRs on gram stain
   which have not yet grown in culture.  Still with low grade fevers.  WBC
   relatively stable.
   - bronch today over concern for progressive LLL and lingular collapse
   - increase PEEP to 10 with hope of recruiting additional alveoli
   - f/u sputum cx
   - cont pip/tazo
   - repeat CXR daily
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   weakness of respiratory muscles further decompensated by overlying
   PNA.   Neuro giving grim prognosis although diagnosis unclear at this
   point.  Family wishes to pursue trach and PEG.
   - increase PEEP to 10 with hope of recruiting additional alveoli
   - continue treating PNA as above; bronch as above
   - palliative care will see her Monday
   - IP aware and will pursue trach/peg on tues v wed.
   .
   #) Neurologic deterioration:  Unknown cause.   LP, MRI, and further
   extensive work-up have been negative.  Differential per neuro is
   primarily prior disease vs early Alzheimers.  Neurology has spoken with
   her family about the grim prognosis.  They would like to go forward
   with aggressive measures as above
   -  EEG by neuro? Unclear if they still want this.
   - palliative care will see her Monday
   - f/u pending studies: 1533, etc.
   .
   #) Gram positive cocci bacterimia?:  coag negative staph in 1 of 4
   bottles.   Likely contaminant.  Off vancomycin.
   .
   #) Refeeding syndrome:  Hypophos and hypokalemia in the context of TF,
   now corrected s/p aggressive electrolyte repletion.  Overall
   electrolyte requirement has diminished.
   - frequent electrolyte checks ([**Hospital1 **]) and repeat PRN
   - continue tube feeds
   .
   #) Dysphagia:  Secondary to neuromuscular weakness.  No need for a
   speech and swallow evaluation given obvious history of aspiration
   events.
   - strict NPO
   - NG tube feeds
   - PEG
   .
   #) Tachycardia:  seems to be either baseline or compensatory for
   ongoing infxn; does not appear to be volume depleted. Continue to
   monitor.
   #) Hypertension:  On amlodipine and HCTZ at home.  Currently BP is on
   low side

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a 6-month history of progressive neurological deterioration. She has cognitive symptoms, progressive aphasia, difficulty swallowing/aspiration, skeletal muscle weakness, and atrophy. She was intubated for increased work of breathing and progressive hypercarbia in the setting of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) overlying her neurologically driven weakness. The patient's prognosis is grim from a neurologic perspective despite the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, specifically a retrocardiac and left lower lobe pneumonia. It is worsening on CXR as the lingula seems to be newly involved. This could indicate a progression of the pneumonia or new atelectasis. The sputum shows non-specified gram-negative rods on gram stain, which have not yet grown in culture. The patient has low-grade fevers and a relatively stable WBC count. She is being bronched today over concern for progressive left lower lobe and lingular collapse. Her PEEP is being increased to 10 with the hope of recruiting additional alveoli. She will continue on pip-tazo, and her sputum culture will be repeated.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to weakness of respiratory muscles further decompensated by underlying PNA. Her neurologists have given her a grim prognosis, although the exact cause of the neurologic deterioration is"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past six months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been experiencing neuromuscular weakness, leading to dysphagia and respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 10 cmH2O. The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but she has a slightly elevated heart rate.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Her blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values, including kidney and liver function tests, electrolytes, and coagulation profile, are within normal limits.

The patient's condition is grim, according to the neurologist, due to the unclear etiology of her neurological deterioration. An extensive workup has been conducted, and repeat MRI of the brain is recommended to assess for any interval changes. Brain tissue biopsy may be considered if possible and if the family still desires aggressive therapy.

The patient's respiratory status is being managed with mechanical"

   A 52 year-old woman with a 6-month history of progressive neurological
   deterioration irst with cognitive symptoms, then progressive aphasia,
   diffculty swallowing/ aspiration, skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy;
   intubated for increased work of breathing and progressive hypercarbia
   in setting of aspiration PNA overlying her neurologically driven
   weakness.  Grim prognosis from neuro despite lack of diagnosis.
   #) Pneumonia:  On pip-tazo for retrocardiac and LLL PNA;  now worsening
   on CXR as lingula seems to be newly involved; CXR progression could
   also be new atelectasis.  Sputum with non-speciated GNRs on gram stain
   which have not yet grown in culture.  Still with low grade fevers.  WBC
   relatively stable.
   - bronch today over concern for progressive LLL and lingular collapse
   - increase PEEP to 10 with hope of recruiting additional alveoli
   - f/u sputum cx

   #) Respiratory failure:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   weakness of respiratory muscles further decompensated by overlying
   PNA.   Neuro giving grim prognosis although diagnosis unclear at this
   point.  Family wishes to pursue trach and PEG.
   - increase PEEP to 10 with hope of recruiting additional alveoli
   - continue treating PNA as above; bronch as above
   - palliative care will see her Monday
   - IP aware and will pursue trach/peg on tues v wed.
   .
   #) Neurologic deterioration:  Unknown cause.   LP, MRI, and further
   extensive work-up have been negative.  Differential per neuro is
   primarily prior disease vs early Alzheimers.  Neurology has spoken with
   her family about the grim prognosis.  They would like to go forward
   with aggressive measures as above
   -  EEG by neuro? Unclear if they still want this.

   now corrected s/p aggressive electrolyte repletion.  Overall
   electrolyte requirement has diminished.
   - frequent electrolyte checks ([**Hospital1 **]) and repeat PRN
   - continue tube feeds

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a worsening pneumonia with involvement of the lingula on chest X-ray. This indicates a possible progression of the infection. The patient is already receiving antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam) for the retrocardiac and left lower lobe pneumonia, but the worsening symptoms suggest a need for further evaluation and treatment.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure due to weakness of respiratory muscles, which has been further compounded by an underlying pneumonia. There is a discussion about increasing PEEP to 10 in hopes of recruiting additional alveoli, but the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.

3. Neurologic deterioration: The patient has a history of progressive neurological deterioration, with symptoms including cognitive impairment, aphasia, difficulty swallowing/aspiration, skeletal muscle weakness, and atrophy. The cause of this deterioration is unknown despite extensive work-up including LP and MRI.

4. Refeeding syndrome: The patient has signs of refeeding syndrome, indicated by hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia in the context of tube feeds. Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected and monitored closely.

5. Dysphagia: The patient's neuromuscular weakness secondary to neurological deterioration has resulted in dysphagia. The patient is at risk for aspiration events, and measures such as strict N"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past six months. She was admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and required intubation. The patient's prognosis is grim, according to the neurologist, and the family has been informed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to weakness of respiratory muscles and an underlying PNA. This condition may worsen if not properly managed with mechanical ventilation, bronchoscopic clearance of secretions, and antibiotics.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration PNA with retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray. Sputum culture did not grow any organisms. It is crucial to continue managing the PNA with appropriate antibiotics, bronchoscopy, and monitoring for any changes on chest X-ray.
3. Neurological Deterioration: The patient's neurological condition is deteriorating, and the cause remains unclear. Repeat MRI brain for interval changes and brain tissue biopsy may be necessary if the family agrees to aggressive therapy. However, the prognosis is grim, and palliative care should also be considered.
4. Dysphagia: The patient has secondary dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness. She should be kept strictly NPO, and NG tube feeds should be considered. PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrost"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months.
- She was admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA) requiring intubation.
- The patient has neuromuscular weakness, resulting in difficulty with breathing and swallowing.
- Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/69 mmHg to 143/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function.
- The patient's condition is being managed with mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) every four hours, bronchoscopy as needed, and antibiotics for the aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's prognosis is described as grim by the neurology team due to the unclear etiology of her neurological deterioration.
- A family meeting is planned to discuss goals of care and further therapies, including the possibility of tracheostomy and percutaneous end"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for six months, resulting in aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and requiring ICU admission and intubation. The patient's prognosis is grim according to neurologic assessment. The patient's current conditions include aspiration PNA, respiratory failure due to muscle weakness, dysphagia, tachycardia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure due to weakness of respiratory muscles compounded by underlying PNA. This condition can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration PNA, which increases the risk of lung infections and can progress to sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Neurological Deterioration: The patient's neurological condition is deteriorating, and the cause remains unclear. This deterioration can lead to further loss of muscle control and functional decline.

4. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness, which poses a risk of aspiration events and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, and there is a concern for potential hypotension, especially when sedation is reduced. This may require close monitoring and possible interventions such as fluid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past six months. She was admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia and required intubation. The patient has a grim prognosis according to neurologic recommendations. Further diagnostic tests and discussions with the family are needed to determine the underlying cause of her neurological deterioration, including Hashimoto's encephalopathy, vasculitic process, or other potential conditions. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. Mechanical ventilation is ongoing, and a family meeting will be held to discuss goals of care and further therapies, such as tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness. She is currently on non-operative management with MIE (mechanical insufflation-exsufflation) every four hours to remove secretions/mucus. The patient's tachycardia may be compensatory for ongoing infection, while her hypertension appears to be well-controlled with medication. A family meeting will be scheduled to discuss the patient's goals of care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological deterioration: The patient's progressive neurological deterioration requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause. If left untreated or unidentified, the condition may worsen, leading to further neurological decline and potential disability or death."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition is grim, with a prognosis determined by neurology. The neurologic deterioration's cause remains unknown after an extensive workup. Further investigations include checking for Hashimoto's encephalopathy, repeating an MRI brain for interval change, and considering a brain tissue biopsy if aggressive therapy is still desired by the family. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, and a family meeting will be held to discuss goals of care and further therapies such as tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Pneumonia is suspected to be community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and antibiotics are being administered. The patient also has dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness, and she is currently on nothing by mouth (NPO) with plans for nasogastric tube feeds and potential PEG. Other issues include tachycardia, hypertension, and constipation (obstipation due to fecal impaction). A family meeting will be held to discuss goals of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes ineffective coping, metabolic alkalosis, hypophosphatemia, dysphagia, respiratory failure, constipation, community-acquired pneumonia, delirium/confusion, hypertension, and tachycardia.

The patient has been experiencing a decline in neurological function, which is still unclear in etiology. The prognosis is grim, as mentioned by the neurologist. Further investigations are recommended, including testing for Hashimoto's encephalopathy, repeating an MRI brain for interval changes, and considering a brain tissue biopsy if the family desires aggressive therapy.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely caused by neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. Sputum culture has shown the presence of GNR, and the patient is being treated with zosyn. Daily chest X-rays will be performed, and bronchoscopy will be done as needed to help remove secretions and mucus.

Due to neuromuscular weakness, the patient is unable to swallow, leading to dysphagia. She is currently on nothing by mouth (NPO) status and receiving nutrition through a nasogastric (NG) tube. Prolonged gastric emptying time is a concern, and percutaneous endoscopic"

   includes
   post-inflammatory, post-infectious, demyelinating, vasculitis or

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and intubated due to aspiration pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical complications and conditions include:

1. Ineffective coping: The patient's progressive neurological decline is a major concern.
2. Alkalosis, metabolic: The patient has an elevated pH level, indicating alkalosis.
3. Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate): The patient has low phosphate levels.
4. Dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing due to neuromuscular weakness.
5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 2]): The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia.
6. Constipation (obstipation, fos): The patient is at risk for constipation due to decreased bowel movement.
7. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has developed bacterial pneumonia while in the ICU.
8. Delirium/confusion: The patient exhibits signs of delirium and confusion.

Other notable findings include multiple FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the frontal and parietal subcortical white matter without enhancement or restricted diffusion, indicating potential post-inflammatory, post-infectious, demyelinating, vasculitis, or small vessel occlusive disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months, requiring ICU admission and intubation. The patient's condition is described as having ineffective coping, with several medical complications including:

1. Progressive neurologic decline: The patient has experienced a progressive decline in neurological function, with an unknown etiology despite extensive workup. This is considered a critical issue and requires further investigation.

2. Alkalosis, metabolic: The patient is showing signs of metabolic alkalosis, which can be indicated by elevated blood pH levels.

3. Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate): The patient's phosphate levels are low, indicating a deficiency in phosphate levels.

4. Dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing, which is likely due to neuromuscular weakness. The patient is currently on a nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding and may require a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube based on the family meeting.

5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia (PNA). The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being transferred to pressure support. Non-invasive ventilation (NIF) trials have failed.

6. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has bacterial pneumonia,"

   some of
   the lesions, slightly more ill-defined compared to the prior study. The
   nature of these lesions is uncertain. The differential diagnosis
   includes
   post-inflammatory, post-infectious, demyelinating, vasculitis or
   slightly
   small vessel occlusive disease. However, given the patient's condition,
   clinical and lab correlation is recommended to exclude the
   possibilities as

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and intubated due to aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Progressive neurologic decline: The patient's neurological condition is worsening, and the cause remains unclear. Further diagnostic tests are pending, including 14.3.3 protein levels (biomarker for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease/neuronal degradation), anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-TPO antibodies (Hashimoto's encephalopathy), and brain tissue biopsy for vasculitis versus Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
2. Alkalosis, metabolic: The patient has an elevated pH level, indicating metabolic alkalosis.
3. Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate): The patient's phosphate levels are low.
4. Dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing due to neuromuscular weakness. She is currently on a strict nothing-per-oral (NPO) diet and has a nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding. Prolonged endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy have been discussed.
5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): The patient's respiratory failure is due to neuromuscular weakness and an underlying pneumonia. She failed non"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months, requiring ICU admission and intubation. She has a history of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has dysphagia and is on a feeding tube. Her blood pressure is improving, and she has been weaned off her home medications. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and has shown improvement. The family has agreed to pursue a full code and plans for tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and brain biopsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying PNA. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the ventilation support is inadequate.
2. Dysphagia: The patient's neuromuscular weakness is causing difficulty in swallowing, leading to the need for tube feeds. There is a risk of aspiration if the tube is not properly managed.
3. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently normotensive, there is a risk of recurrent hypertension due to underlying conditions or complications.
4. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP): Although the patient has completed a course of antibiotics and shows improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent HAP if proper infection prevention measures are not"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. She has failed noninvasive ventilation and pressure support and continues on assist-control mechanical ventilation. The patient also has hypothesized Hashimoto encephalopathy, but anti-thyroglobulin and anti-TPO antibodies are negative. There is suspicion of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the 14.3.3 protein is pending. The patient has completed an 8-day course of piperacillin-tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia and now presents with fevers again. She is being restarted on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for 8 days. The patient has dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness and is currently on nothing by mouth with nasogastric tube feeds. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. The patient's tachycardia appears to be improving and is not volume depleted. Her hypertension is being managed with medication, and her blood pressure is now within normal range. The patient's code status is FULL, and the plan includes tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, and brain biopsy."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months, requiring ICU admission and intubation due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has failed noninvasive ventilation and pressure support. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 138/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and difficult to arouse. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL, elevated platelets at 451 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 0.5 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels ranging from 87-129 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin due to suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. Cultures have been obtained from blood, urine, and bronchoscopy.

The patient's neurological condition remains grim with an unknown etiology after extensive workup. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and Hashimoto's encephalitis. A brain biopsy is being considered, and the family has been contacted"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's family decided against brain biopsy but wants tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- There was no growth on sputum culture.
- The patient has been receiving various antibiotics including Piperacillin, Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with Fentanyl and Midazolam infusions.
- She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness.
- Other medical issues include tachycardia and hypertension, which are improving with treatment.
- The patient's goals of care include full code status, tracheostomy, PEG, and brain biopsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the neuromuscular weakness progresses or if there are complications from mechanical ventilation.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has developed HAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potential sepsis.
3. Dysphagia: The"

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and dysphagia secondary to neuromuscular weakness. She also has hypertension, which is currently being managed with amlodipine and HCTZ. The patient's code status is set to ""full code,"" and the plan includes tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and brain biopsy.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The results of her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis are pending.

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 223 K/uL. Other lab results, including glucose, electrolytes,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for six months. She has been admitted to the ICU and intubated due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. She has failed noninvasive ventilation and pressure support, so she continues on assist-control ventilation. The plan is to decrease sedation, continue mechanical ventilation, and contact an interventional procedure (IP) for a tracheostomy most likely on Tuesday.

The patient has also been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which is suspected to be caused by aspiration or an inability to clear the lungs due to neuromuscular weakness. She completed an 8-day course of antibiotics (zosyn) but has developed fevers again. Therefore, she has been restarted on antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/cipro) for 8 days, with follow-up cultures and monitoring of the fever curve.

Additionally, the patient has dysphagia, which is also due to neuromuscular weakness. She is currently on nothing by mouth (NPO) status, receiving nutrition through a nasogastric (NG) tube. The plan is to contact IP for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement most likely on Tuesday.

Other notable assessments include tachycardia, which is improving and does not appear to be volume depleted, and hypertension,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 4-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown origin fever. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. Vital signs show a slight elevation in temperature, within normal range for a child. Heart rate is stable, blood pressure is within normal limits, respiratory rate is within expected range for sedation, and oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with settings of Vt (set) at 400 mL, RR (set) at 12, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and RSBI of 95. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to sedation and mechanical ventilation. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytosis, and various electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective Coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms may worsen their overall condition, potentially leading to further complications.
2. Progressive Neurologic Decline: The patient's neurologic decline could be due to several factors, including the underlying illness, sedation, or complications from mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Alkalosis, Metabolic: The patient's metabolic alkalosis needs to be managed carefully to maintain proper pH balance and avoid complications associated with electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypophosphatemia (Low Phosphate): The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia requiring intubation. The patient's family does not want to proceed with a brain biopsy. The potential diagnoses being considered are vasculitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Whipple disease, or an unknown cause. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is being considered for tracheostomy. The patient also has hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness. The patient's blood pressure is being managed, and she is currently normotensive. The patient's goals of care include being a full code and planning for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is NPO for tracheostomy and PEG. Her current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and famotidine. The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 525 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly low platelet count. The patient's serum electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's condition is grim, and further testing is pending, including 14.3.3 protein for CJD and PCR for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia (aspiration / Healthcare-associated Pneumonia). She has undergone tracheostomy and received zosyn for 8 days. 

The patient is currently being treated for HAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. She is also on mechanical ventilation on assist control mode, and efforts are being made to clear secretions through MIE, bronch, and position changes. 

She has been experiencing diarrhea since May 10th, and tests are being done to check for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has a right shoulder rash, which is likely due to shingles, and is being treated with acyclovir. A DFA test for varicella-zoster virus is being conducted to rule out disseminated zoster.

The patient's neurological deterioration is attributed to diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Extensive workup has been performed, but no significant findings have been revealed. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Whipple's disease, and an unknown condition. The prognosis is grim, and the family does not want to proceed with a brain biopsy. Biomarkers for CJD/neuronal degradation are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to pneumonia. The patient's neurological condition is still unknown after extensive workup. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Whipple's disease, and unknown causes. The family does not want to proceed with a brain biopsy. Tests for CJD and Whipple's disease will be conducted when a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is done.

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. She has failed non-invasive ventilation (NIF) and pressure support, so she will continue on assist-control ventilation and contact the intensivist for a tracheostomy. The patient will be nil per os (NPO) starting from [5-11] to prepare for the tracheostomy and PEG placement.

The patient had a previous hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) treated with zosyn for 8 days. Sputum culture showed sparse gram-negative rods (GNR). She now has fevers again over the weekend, so she has been restarted on vancomycin (vanc), cefepime (cefepime), and ciprofloxacin (cipro). She will continue these antibiotics for 8 days and follow-up with cultures."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past six months. She required ICU admission and intubation.
- The patient has respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and pneumonia (aspiration/hospital-acquired). She underwent intubation on [**4-28**], tracheostomy on [**5-11**], and received antibiotics (zosyn) for eight days until June 6th.
- The patient also experienced diarrhea starting on [**5-10**], which improved without intervention. A test for Clostridium difficile is pending.
- She has a rash on her right shoulder, which is likely due to shingles. Acyclovir was started on [**5-11**], and a follow-up DFA VZV of mouth lesion will be done to rule out disseminated zoster.
- The patient's neurological deterioration is attributed to diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Extensive workup has been performed, but no significant findings were discovered. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Whipple's disease, or an unknown cause. Due to the grim prognosis, the family has declined the option of a brain biopsy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for six months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness and pneumonia. The patient has undergone several procedures, including tracheostomy, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and duodenal biopsy. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with assist control mode and receives continuous sedation.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including diarrhea, a right shoulder rash suspected to be shingles, and neurologic deterioration with diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Extensive workup has been done, but no conclusive diagnosis has been made. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Whipple's disease, and unknown causes. The prognosis is grim, and the family does not wish to proceed with brain biopsy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 102/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 43.8 kg at admission to 41.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,513 mL and output of 1,295 mL since 12 AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for six months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness and pneumonia. The patient has undergone several procedures including PEG placement, tracheostomy, and duodenal biopsy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (with a normal range of 89-122 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 102/69 mmHg to 90/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (with a set rate of 12), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a volume control mode using a tracheostomy tube, set ventilation volume of 400 mL, respiratory system resistance compensation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values such as glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, diarrhea, right shoulder rash"

","Summary:
The patient is a 5-year-old with a history of Whipple's disease who is currently in the ICU. They have undergone several procedures including PEG placement, duodenal biopsy, tracheostomy, and radial artery catheterization. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a rash on their right shoulder, suspected to be shingles. They have received multiple doses of antibiotics and antiviral medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 102/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 43.8 kg at admission to 41.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,513 mL and output of 1,295 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 218 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation, set at a volume of 400 mL and rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.29, which suggests metabolic alkalosis. Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and abnormal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's neurological status is concerning, with progressive decline. They also have multiple medical problems including wound infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for six months.
- She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia (aspiration/pneumonia). She underwent intubation and tracheostomy.
- The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
- She also has a right shoulder rash, likely shingles, causing significant pain. Acyclovir was initially given, but its status is unclear. Fentanyl has been increased for pain control, and gabapentin and a lidocaine patch have been started.
- The patient's neurological deterioration is attributed to diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. An extensive workup has been done, but it has been unrevealing. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and Whipple's disease. Whipple's PCR is negative.
- The family is reconsidering a brain biopsy. Neurology needs to be present at the family meeting. CJD biomarker testing (14.3.3 protein) is pending.
- The patient has dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness and has undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She is"

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She required ICU admission and intubation due to respiratory failure, possibly caused by pneumonia aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has undergone several interventions including intubation, tracheostomy, and antibiotic therapy. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with assist control mode and is sedated. Other issues include diarrhea, right shoulder rash likely due to shingles, neurologic deterioration, dysphagia, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient's prognosis is grim, and the family is hesitant to proceed with a brain biopsy. Further workup is needed to determine the cause of her neurological decline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further if she develops ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or if her neuromuscular weakness worsens.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological condition may continue to decline if the underlying cause is not identified and treated promptly.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections, such as VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infections, due to her prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.
4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's diarrhea may progress and lead to electrolyte imbalances or dehydration if not managed appropriately.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months.
- She required ICU admission and intubation due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia (PNA) and neuromuscular weakness.
- She underwent tracheostomy on [**5-11**] and was on zosyn for 8 days until June 6th.
- Her left lower lobe collapsed with a mucous plug.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation with poor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI).
- She has a right shoulder rash, likely shingles, causing significant pain.
- Neurologic deterioration is ongoing with diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology.
- A family meeting is scheduled to discuss brain biopsy and the need for neurology consultation.
- The patient also has dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness and had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on [**5-11**].
- Her tachycardia and hypertension are being monitored, and her loose stools have resolved.
- The patient is also experiencing depression, for which citalopram has been started.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is currently supported by mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening lung function could arise.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological condition is worsening,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months, requiring ICU admission and intubation. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and aspiration/HAP. The patient has a right shoulder rash, likely shingles, and is experiencing significant pain. She also has neurologic deterioration with diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. The differential diagnosis includes vasculitis, CJD, and Whipple's disease, with Whipple's PCR negative. The patient has dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness and has undergone PEG placement. She also has tachycardia with an unclear etiology and hypertension that is being managed with medication. The patient's condition is complicated by loose stools, which resolved on [**5-10**], and Clostridium difficile infection was not sent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying PNA. She requires ongoing mechanical ventilation and monitoring of secretions and daily chest X-ray.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures dropped to the 70s/50s at night, indicating possible hypotension. This may be related to sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Shingles (Herpes Zoster): The patient has a vesicular rash on"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past six months. She was admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes respiratory failure secondary to neuromuscular weakness and aspiration pneumonia.

Currently, the patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for her HAP, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. She is also on pressure support ventilation and being weaned off sedation as tolerated. The ABG values are within normal limits, and the chest x-ray shows no significant changes.

The patient has low-grade fevers of unclear etiology, with possible causes including line infection, Clostridium difficile, zoster, or an underlying chronic inflammatory process. Further tests such as pan-culture, C. difficile toxin testing, and monitoring of the fever curve are recommended.

Regarding the patient's neurological deterioration, extensive workup has been done but remains unrevealing. Differential diagnoses include CNS vasculitis, demyelinating disorder, CJD, or unknown causes. The family prefers steroids but has declined brain biopsy. Biomarkers for CJD/neuronal degradation are pending.

The patient also has a right shoulder rash likely due to shingles, with significant pain and an oral lesion positive for HSV-1. Acyclovir therapy has been initiated, along with gabapentin and lidocaine patch for pain"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months, requiring ICU admission and intubation. She has respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia (aspiration/HAP). She has a complete collapse of the left lower lobe with mucous plug. She is currently on mechanical ventilation on assist control mode, with poor RSBI and decreased FiO2 from 50 to 40%. Secretions and daily chest X-ray should be monitored, and bronchoscopic evaluation should be considered if her condition worsens.

She also has a right shoulder rash, likely shingles, with significant pain. Acyclovir has been started, and fentanyl has been increased for pain control. Gabapentin and lidocaine patch have also been prescribed. Sarna is being used for itching, and a viral culture of the mouth lesion is being performed to rule out disseminated zoster.

Neurological deterioration is present with diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. An extensive workup has been done, but it has been unrevealing. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis, CJD, and Whipple's disease. Whipple's PCR is negative.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:   52 y o F w/ progressive neurodegenerative
   process of unclear etiology s/p extensive work-up. Admit from rehab
   [**4-27**] for concern for aspiration course c/b resp failure in setting of
   weakness, severe electrolyte imbalance and aspiration pneumonia and
   remains ventilator-dependent because of poor neurologic function s/p
   trach placement.
   Empiric steroids (1mg/kg) started yesterday. Became hypoxemic (pao2 45)
   on PS trial (15/5) and placed back on ACV.  Transient hypotension with
   positional change and with sleeping
 fluid responsive.

     * Pna
     * Atelectasis LLL
     * Low grade temps
     * Diarrhea
     * Herpes zoster inf (on acyclovir)
   Pt  has continued to have low grade temps throughout  hospital
   course--multiple potential etiologies including underlying neuro
   process (possible CNS vasculitis) vs infection vs clot or atelectasis.
   She remains on broad antibx with no revealing micro findings.  Repeat
   cx's pending, c diff neg X 2, monitor picc line site (no + blood cxs to
   date), had neg UE Us and CTA for pe and has stable lfts. ? related to
   zostor infection.
   Agree with plan to d/c empiric antibx as has completed 8 day course for
   VAP/HAP. Continue chest PT and pulm toilet for atelectasis/plugging.
   Became hypoxemic with small TVs on PS 15.  Suspect she develops
   significant atelectasis and v/q mismatch which resolves when back on
   ACV.  Continue acv support--adjusting MV to optimize pH (decreased TV
   375/rate 10).  Continues on day 2 empiric steroids for possible
   reversible neuro-process (vasculitis or demyelinating process).
   Neuro-degredation markers remain pending. Steroids will likely be a
   prolonged course and would consider starting PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].  Remains
   on thiamine / folate.  Continue celexa for labile emotional status,
   monitoring closely while on steroids.
   In terms of diarrhea
will cont empiric flagyl pending additional neg  c
   diff cx, holding  bowel reg and gi motility agents. Fluids to keep up
   with diarrheal losses.  ICU: picc, sq hep, full code, tfs, Rehab
   screening. Continue family discussion/communication regarding goals of
   care.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times, most recently for concern for aspiration, and remains ventilator-dependent due to poor neurological function. The patient has a history of severe electrolyte imbalance and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, hypotension with positional change, and an ABG showing alkalosis. She is intubated, alert, and inconsistently responds to simple commands. She has a rash consistent with shingles and a history of HSV-1 infection. Her labs show a low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. Her chest X-ray shows a tracheostomy, PICC line, and atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

The patient's active issues include a neurodegenerative process, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, atelectasis, low-grade temperatures, and diarrhea. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which will be discontinued as she has completed an 8-day course for ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She will continue with chest physiotherapy and pulmonary toilet for atelectasis and plugging. The patient's ventilator settings will be adjusted to optimize pH, and she will continue on day 2 empiric steroids for a possible reversible neurological process.

The patient's neurological markers are pending, and she will likely require prolonged steroid therapy. She remains"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past six months. She required ICU admission and intubation.
- The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers of unclear etiology, with possible causes including line infection, Clostridium difficile infection, zoster, or a chronic inflammatory process. She has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) since May 8th.
- The patient has respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying PNA (aspiration/HAP). She underwent intubation on April 28th and tracheostomy on May 11th.
- She was previously on Zosyn for eight days (May 29th - June 6th) and is currently on vancomycin and cefepime. The latter will be stopped today.
- The patient has a wound infection with signs of cellulitis around her right shoulder, likely due to shingles. She also has dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness, for which a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was placed on May 11th.
- She has hypertension, which is currently being managed with amlodipine and HCTZ. However, her blood pressures are low, so the medications have been held.
- The patient also has depression, for which citalopram has been started.
- The patient has been on a ventilator since April 28th and is currently on assist-control (AC) mode at 50%. Her ABG shows pH 7.48, indicating metabolic alkalosis. She also has hypophosphatemia (low phosphate), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), constipation, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), delirium/confusion, and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Wound infection: The patient's wound infection around the right shoulder is already present and requires close monitoring and appropriate treatment.
2. Progressive neurologic decline: The patient's neurological condition is deteriorating progressively, and further evaluation and management are necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and her respiratory status should be closely monitored to prevent further complications.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's ABG indicates metabolic alkalosis, which needs to be corrected to maintain acid-base balance.
5. Hypophosphatemia: The patient has low phosphate levels, which can lead to various complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac dysfunction, and respiratory distress.
6. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium/confusion, and appropriate measures should be taken to manage this condition.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and ongoing monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months.
- She required ICU admission and intubation due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia and neuromuscular weakness.
- The patient has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation.
- She has been treated with various antibiotics for her pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
- Low-grade fevers are present, with unclear etiology. Possible causes include line infection, Clostridium difficile, zoster, or a chronic inflammatory process.
- The patient's neurological condition has worsened, with diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Extensive workup has been done, but no definitive diagnosis has been made. Possible causes include CNS vasculitis, demyelinating disorder, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
- The patient has a right shoulder rash, which is likely due to shingles. She is experiencing significant pain, and a mouth lesion culture shows HSV-1, making disseminated zoster less likely.
- Acyclovir was started for the shingles, along with gabapentin and lidocaine patch for pain control.
- The patient has dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement was performed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She has been admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia requiring intubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. She also has a PEG tube for dysphagia. Her recent lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. However, her creatinine level is elevated at 0.9 mg/dL. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia and has received acyclovir for a suspected viral infection. She is also on prednisone for suspected CNS vasculitis. The patient's fever has improved but is still unclear in etiology. Other issues include a right shoulder rash likely due to shingles, tachycardia with an unclear cause, hypertension controlled with medication, and depression. The patient's daughter wishes to meet with palliative care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia.
2. Neurological deterioration with diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology.
3. CJD or other neurodegenerative disorders.
4. Right shoulder rash from shingles.
5. Hypotension and tachycardia with unclear causes.
6. Depression associated with chronic illness.
7. Risk of hospital-acquired infections due to prolonged ICU stay"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has had low-grade fevers for an extended period, which could be indicative of an underlying infection or inflammation. The differential diagnosis includes line infection (due to the PICC line), shingles (herpes zoster), or an underlying chronic inflammatory process such as CNS vasculitis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory acidosis caused by weakness, severe electrolyte imbalance, and aspiration pneumonia. She remains ventilator-dependent due to poor neurologic function.

3. Neurologic deterioration: The patient has diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. An extensive workup has been unrevealing, and the differential diagnosis includes CNS vasculitis, demyelinating disorder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), or an unknown cause. The family has agreed to start prednisone as empirical treatment for possible vasculitis or acute demyelinating syndrome.

4. Right shoulder rash: The patient has a rash that is likely due to shingles (herpes zoster). This has improved in pain, and treatment includes acyclovir, gabapentin, lidocaine patch, and sarna for itching.

5. Dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing due to neuromus"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for six months. She was admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia requiring intubation. 

The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes line infection, Clostridium difficile infection (with toxin-negative stool tests), herpes zoster, or a chronic inflammatory process such as CNS vasculitis. The patient has been treated with cefepime and vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia and also received metronidazole. 

The patient also has respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. She underwent intubation on [**4-28**] and had a tracheostomy on [**5-11**]. She was previously on Zosyn for eight days (5/29 - [**5-7**]). 

Neurological deterioration is mentioned, with diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Extensive workup was done, but no definitive diagnosis was reached. The differential diagnosis includes CNS vasculitis, demyelinating disorder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), or an unknown cause. The family prefers not to pursue a brain biopsy, and prednisone was started on [**5-15**]. 

The patient also has a right shoulder rash, likely shingles, and is experiencing significant pain. Acyclovir was started on [**5-11**] and will be continued. 

Dysphagia is attributed to neuromuscular weakness, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement was performed on [**5-11**]. 

Tachycardia and hypertension are also noted, but their causes are unclear. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl for pain control and has been weaned off sedation. 

Depression is mentioned, with the patient occasionally crying due to her chronic illness. Citalopram has been started at a dose of 10mg. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving fiber source HN (full) at 45 mL/hour and will continue to be monitored for glycemic control. The patient has a PICC line in place since [**2151-5-4**] and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers that are improving but of unclear origin. She also has respiratory failure, likely secondary to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. A tracheostomy was performed, and she received antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Neurological deterioration is ongoing, with diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Extensive workup has been done, but no definitive diagnosis has been made. Steroids have been started, and further evaluation is planned. The patient also has a right shoulder rash that is likely shingles, dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness, and tachycardia of unclear etiology. She has hypertension but is currently on hold due to low blood pressures. The patient is also dealing with depression. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of wounds and may be at risk for further skin breakdown, especially considering her immobility and neurological decline.
2. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure has been low, indicating a potential risk for hypotension, although it does not appear to be due to shock.
3. Wound infection: Given the patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobility,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months, requiring ICU admission and intubation. She has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, hypotension, wound infection, fever of unknown origin, ineffective coping, dysphagia, respiratory failure, constipation, pneumonia, delirium, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive neurologic decline: The patient has been experiencing a progressive neurological decline of unclear etiology. This requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause and potential treatment options.
2. Alkalosis, metabolic: The patient's laboratory results show a high bicarbonate level (HCO3-), indicating metabolic alkalosis. This condition can lead to symptoms such as confusion, muscle twitching, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate): The patient's serum phosphate level is low, which can result in symptoms like muscle weakness, bone pain, and heart problems.
4. Dysphagia: The patient is experiencing difficulty swallowing, which may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and affect her ability to receive adequate nutrition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which requires ongoing mechanical ventilation support. This condition can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Constipation (obstipation, fos): The patient is at risk of developing constipation, which can lead to discomfort, distension, and potential"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months, requiring ICU admission and intubation. She has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, hypotension, wound infection, fever of unknown origin, ineffective coping, metabolic alkalosis, hypophosphatemia, dysphagia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), pneumonia (bacterial, community-acquired), delirium/confusion, failure to thrive/weight loss, profound peripheral weakness, and diffuse white matter brain disease.

The patient's recent events include starting on methylprednisolone 1gm IV daily x 5 days, as well as insulin/lisinopril while on steroids, discontinuing metronidazole (C. diff negative x 3), being on fentanyl gtt, pressure support, two episodes of agitation responding well to haloperidol 1mg IV, and checking HIV VL. The patient's PPD is 18mm at [**Hospital1 1241**], and there is a question about needing INH/pyridoxine -- per daughter ([**Name (NI) 6629**]), as the patient has never received any TB medications before.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were acyclovir on [**2151-5-16**] 12:00 AM, metronidazole on [**2151-5-16**] 12:00 AM, cefepime on [**2151-5-16**] 02:00 AM, and vancomycin on [**2151-5-16**] 07:46 AM.

Infusions include fentanyl (concentrate) at 50 mcg/hour, haloperidol (Haldol) on [**2151-5-17**] 02:00 PM, heparin sodium (prophylaxis) on [**2151-5-17**] 03:26 PM, and other medications such as insulin, lisinopril, and steroids.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), current temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 110 bpm (64-124 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 123/70mmHg to 183/161mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (11-31 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 41.5 kg, with a height of 64 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,861 mL (559 mL of which was IV fluids) and a total output of 2,015 mL (410 mL of which was urine output).

The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and is ventilated using CPAP/PSV mode. The set tidal volume is 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure is 17 cmH2O, and plateau pressure is 19 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.3, PCO2 of 31 mmHg, PO2 of 116 mmHg, HCO3- of 34 mEq/L, and base excess of -7.3 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals an arousable patient with occasional smiles, a vesicular rash on the back inferior to the right scapula (improved), s/p trach, PERRL, mild tachycardia, no murmurs, bilateral breath sounds, soft bowel sounds, warm extremities, and no edema.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, glucose of 138 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 99 mEq/L, calcium of 7 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL, phosphate of 3.0 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 34 mEq/L, BUN of 27.1 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 487 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological decline: The patient's progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology could potentially lead to further decline in neurological function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if not adequately supported, potentially leading to worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's community-acquired bacterial pneumonia could worsen if not appropriately treated, leading to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction.
4. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and wound infection may progress, increasing the risk of cellulitis or systemic infection.
5. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's fever of unknown origin may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process that needs to be identified and managed promptly.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, especially in the context of hypovolemia, may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
7. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis should be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications related to electrolyte imbalances.
8. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's hypophosph"

   Disposition: ICU for now, will need transition to LTAC in future
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past 6 months. She was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, depression, and an upcoming procedure.

The patient has shown improvements in her fever curve, likely due to the antibiotic treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia. However, she continues to experience respiratory failure attributed to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. A tracheostomy was performed, and she has been receiving zosyn and cefepime/vancomycin for HAP.

The patient's neurological deterioration is characterized by diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Extensive workup has been done, but no definitive diagnosis has been made. Potential differential diagnoses include CNS vasculitis, demyelinating disorder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), or an unknown cause. Prednisone has been started, and further discussions regarding dosage and course will be had with the neurologist. Additionally, a biomarker for CJD/neuronal degradation is pending, and an electromyogram (EMG) will be arranged by the neurologist.

The patient also presents with a right shoulder rash, which is likely shingles, as it has improved in pain. A mouth lesion culture showed HSV-1, making disseminated zoster less likely. Treatment includes acyclovir"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for 6 months. She was admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia requiring intubation and tracheostomy. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Low-grade fevers: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, which have been improving. The etiology is unclear, with possible causes including line infection, shingles, or an underlying chronic inflammatory process such as CNS vasculitis. 

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia (aspiration/HAP). She underwent tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. Pressure support is being weaned as tolerated, and sedation is also being weaned.

3. Neurologic deterioration: The patient has diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. An extensive workup has been done without revealing the cause. Differential diagnoses include CNS vasculitis, demyelinating disorder, CJD, or unknown. The family prefers to avoid brain biopsy, so methylprednisolone therapy is being considered. Biomarkers for CJD/neuronal degradation are pending. An HIV test from occupational safety and health records is being reviewed, mental status is being monitored, and an EMG is arranged by neurology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past 6 months. She required ICU admission and intubation after experiencing pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, with a grim prognosis. Steroids have been stopped, and palliative care has been consulted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Due to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia, the patient may experience respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.
2. Infection: The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with antibiotics, but there is still a possibility of ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary.
3. Shingles (Herpes Zoster): The patient has a right shoulder rash that is likely due to shingles. Acyclovir has been prescribed for 14 days.
4. Dysphagia: The patient's neuromuscular weakness has resulted in dysphagia, leading to the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for feeding.
5. Low-Grade Fevers: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, which could be due to line infections, shingles, or underlying chronic inflammatory processes. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure"

She was admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia and required intubation and tracheostomy. The patient has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, with a grim prognosis. Steroids have been stopped.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/59 to 166/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving fentanyl infusion and other ICU medications.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,241 mL and output of 1,385 mL, resulting in a balance of 856 mL. The patient has received 1,082 mL of total fluids through the gastrointestinal tract, 504 mL through intravenous fluids, and 341 mL through the tracheostomy.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 12.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.9 g/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) at 151 mg/dL, blood glucose at 151 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) at 141 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 3.9 mEq/L, and chloride"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration of unclear etiology for the past 6 months. She has been admitted to the ICU and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has several medical problems and complications, including:

1. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing loose stools, which started in the ICU. Loperamide has been started as a treatment.

2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had low-grade fevers that are improving but the cause remains unclear. Possible causes include line infection, shingles, or an underlying chronic inflammatory process.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to neuromuscular weakness and pneumonia. She has undergone a tracheostomy and is mechanically ventilated. Pressure support is being weaned as tolerated, and sedation is also being weaned.

4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological condition is worsening, characterized by diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Extensive workup has been done without revealing a specific cause. Differential diagnoses include CNS vasculitis, demyelinating disorder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), or an unknown cause. A brain biopsy has not been performed due to family refusal. Steroids have been given for potential CNS vasculitis. Testing for CJD biomarkers is pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 5-year-old boy admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, unable to be weaned off vent support. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is dependent on the ventilator. There are low-grade fevers present. The patient has a history of ALS/dementia, end-stage. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/53 mmHg to 162/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is 41.5 kg, and height is 64 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,652 mL (492 mL PO, 1,080 mL TF, 322 mL IVF) and an output of 2,540 mL (445 mL Urine, 47 mL NG). The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium and acyclovir. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count and platelets, with normal hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, ventilator set at CMV mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 204. The physical examination reveals wheezes and rhonchi in the lungs, as well as a heart murmur. The patient has a g-tube in the abdomen and no edema in the extremities.

Potential Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's dependency on the ventilator increases the risk of developing VAP. The low-grade fever and abnormal lung sounds may indicate an infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium to prevent DVT, but the presence of immobility and central venous catheters increases the risk of developing a clot.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator tubing can lead to pressure ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of acquiring a nosocomial infection.
5. Barotrauma: The high pressures generated by the ventilator can cause barotrauma to the lungs, leading to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
6. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The use of high tidal volumes and excessive pressures during ventilation can result in VILI, characterized by lung inflammation and damage."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration over six months due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia (aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia). The patient has undergone a tracheostomy, complete collapse of the left lower lobe with mucous plug, and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for dysphagia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation through the tracheostomy, weaning pressure support as tolerated, and weaning sedation. The patient's right shoulder rash is likely shingles, and she is being treated with acyclovir, lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch, and morphine as needed for pain. The etiology of her tachycardia is unclear, but it does not appear to be hypovolemia. Her hypertension is being managed with lisinopril, and her depression is being treated with citalopram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic he"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurologic deterioration due to ALS and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is secondary to neuromuscular weakness and an underlying pneumonia (aspiration/HAP). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is now on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/57 mmHg to 154/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's current weight is 41.5 kg, and her height is 64 inches.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 9.3 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 112 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.4 mg/dL, glucose level of 196 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 140 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 101 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) level of 9.0 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4) level of 4.4 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count is 400,000/mL, and her prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 127, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, and compliance of 33.3 cmH2O/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided.

The patient's physical examination reveals a vesicular rash on her back inferior to the right scapula, which has improved. She is arousable, occasionally smiles, and has no murmurs on cardiac examination. Her breath sounds are bilater"

","Summary:
The patient is a thin and unresponsive individual with congested lungs, indicating respiratory distress. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support and has not been able to be weaned off. There is a history of low-grade fever, suggesting a possible infection. The patient has a known case of ALS and dementia, and is in the end-stage of the disease. The patient is also being treated for VZV infection with acyclovir. The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and a slightly elevated body temperature. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and abnormal liver function tests. The cultures for sputum and urine are negative. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on continuous ventilator support and unable to be weaned off, indicating severe respiratory failure. This could potentially lead to further lung damage or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Infection: The presence of a low-grade fever and recent cultures indicate a possible infection. This could be due to hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated infections, which can complicate the patient's condition and increase the risk of sepsis.

3. UTI: The patient is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with antibiotics. If left untreated or if the infection becomes resistant to the current treatment, it"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration over the past six months. She was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and required intubation and tracheostomy. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, and her condition has been complicated by several medical issues.

Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Deterioration: The patient has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. Supportive care and a trial of riluzole are planned, although there is uncertainty about the availability of a pharmacist.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever of 100.3, which could be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or possibly pneumonia. Further investigation is needed, and ciprofloxacin was previously discontinued.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to neuromuscular weakness and underlying pneumonia. She has had a tracheostomy and was on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Weaning of sedation and pressure support is planned.
4. Right Shoulder Rash: The patient has a right shoulder rash that is likely caused by shingles. The pain has improved, and acyclovir has been started for treatment.
5. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia is a result of neuromuscular weakness, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement has been done for nutrition.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration over six months due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and required intubation. She also underwent a tracheostomy and was started on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes low-grade fevers, respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and effusion, agitation that responds to haloperidol, a right shoulder rash likely caused by shingles, dysphagia resulting from neuromuscular weakness, tachycardia with unclear etiology, hypertension previously managed with amlodipine and HCTZ, and depression/agitation. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her creatinine level is within normal range, while her glucose level has been fluctuating. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/76 mmHg to 127/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with rapid dementia and associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute respiratory failure, attributed to neuromuscular disease. He is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a rash secondary to herpes zoster infection on his right shoulder and is being treated with Haldol for agitation related to anxiety.

In terms of medical complications, the patient's critical condition and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The healthcare team is taking appropriate measures to prevent VAP, including elevating the head of bed (HOB), providing mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system's breath sounds and blood gases regularly.

Another potential complication is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is why the patient is on systemic anticoagulation prophylaxis. The patient's nutritional support is being managed with fiber source enteral nutrition at goal.

Given the patient's advanced stage of ALS and poor prognosis, long-term care facility placement is being arranged. The patient's code status is set to full code.

Overall, the patient's main medical complication at the moment is acute respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, and efforts are being made to manage this condition and prevent additional complications such as VAP and DVT."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of rapid dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, which is attributed to his neuromuscular disease. The patient is mechanically ventilated and has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) at goal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia. To prevent VAP, the patient's head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up procedures will be implemented.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in critically ill patients increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures, such as the use of compression boots and systemic anticoagulation, should be considered to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk for stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid production. Prophylactic administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) can help prevent the development of stress ulcers.
4. Malnutrition: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and impaired swallowing can lead to malnutrition. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) to meet his nutritional needs.
5. Agitation and delirium: Critically ill patients often experience agitation and delirium. The patient is being managed with hal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurologic deterioration due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and intubation. The patient is awaiting placement and requires tracheostomy support. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but her fever persists. Her respiratory failure is attributed to neuromuscular weakness and pleural effusion. She has agitation that responds to haloperidol and quetiapine. The patient also has a right shoulder rash likely due to shingles, and completed a course of acyclovir. She has dysphagia and has undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Her tachycardia is of unclear etiology, and her hypertension was previously managed with amlodipine and HCTZ, but is now uncontrolled. The patient exhibits signs of depression and agitation. Her current ICU care includes nutrition via fibersource, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration over the past six months due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She has been admitted to the ICU and intubated, awaiting tracheostomy placement.

The patient's medical history includes pneumonia requiring ICU admission and intubation, for which she underwent a tracheostomy. She also has a history of fever of unknown origin, which was initially treated with ciprofloxacin but later found to be caused by a yeast infection. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and has received multiple antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient is experiencing agitation, which is managed with haloperidol and quetiapine. She has a right shoulder rash that is likely shingles and has completed a course of acyclovir. The patient also has dysphagia due to neuromuscular weakness and has undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for nutrition.

Other issues include tachycardia of unclear etiology, hypertension previously controlled with medication but now resolving, and depression/agitation. The patient's code status is full code, and she is awaiting placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness and effusion, wound infection due to immobility and potential breakdown of skin integrity, ineffective coping with chronic illness, and"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation and tracheostomy. The patient has a history of pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), delirium/confusion, fever, ineffective coping, impaired balance, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 86/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's platelet count and kidney function are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired peripheral vascular function, unassessed neurologic status, and unassessed skin integrity. The patient's recent imaging studies are not provided in the progress note.

The patient has multiple medical complications including diarrhea, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient is also exhibiting emotional lability.

In terms of potential medical complications, there are a few notable points:

1. The patient has a history of rapid dementia with associated ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and eventually paralysis. As the disease progresses, respiratory muscles can be affected, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient's current condition suggests that they may be experiencing acute respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease.

2. The patient has a rash secondary to herpes zoster (shingles) on the right shoulder. Shingles can cause significant pain and discomfort, which may further complicate the patient's overall condition and require specific management.

3. The patient is experiencing agitation and anxiety. The use of Haldol, an antipsychotic medication, is mentioned as a possible intervention to manage agitation.

4. The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding (TF), which is being administered at goal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of rapid dementia and associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
- The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure attributed to neuromuscular disease.
- The patient exhibits emotional lability and agitation, which is managed with prn Haldol.
- The patient has a rash secondary to herpes zoster infection on the right shoulder.
- The patient's nutritional support is being provided through tube feeding (TF) at goal.
- The patient is awaiting long-term care facility placement.
- The patient's condition is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or quantity is important. Early identification and treatment of VAP can help prevent complications.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility associated with critical illness increases the risk of developing DVT. The use of compression boots is mentioned as prophylaxis, but close monitoring for signs of DVT, such as leg swelling or pain, is essential. If DVT is suspected, appropriate diagnostic measures and treatment should be initiated promptly.
3. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She has been admitted to the ICU requiring intubation and tracheostomy placement.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has neuromuscular weakness and pleural effusion, which has led to the need for mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.

2. Fever: The patient continues to have low-grade fevers, and a urine antigen test was mildly positive on Saturday. Initially, she was started on ciprofloxacin, but it was discontinued as the culture grew yeast only. Further follow-up cultures are planned.

3. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, but no specific details are provided in the progress note regarding the cause or treatment.

4. Neurological decline: The patient has been experiencing a progressive neurologic decline, with symptoms including impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired balance, motor function, muscle performance, transfers, and ventilation.

5. Skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, with no further details provided.

6. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension not due to shock, and her blood pressure is currently in the 80s systolic and 60s diastolic.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She has been admitted to the ICU and intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with various medical complications including respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, agitation, right shoulder rash (likely shingles), dysphagia, tachycardia, hypertension, and depression/agitation. She has been treated with multiple medications such as haloperidol, quetiapine, acyclovir, lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch, morphine, sarna, PEG feeds, citalopram, and seroquel.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired ventilation due to neuromuscular weakness, which may lead to respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient continues to have low-grade fevers, and there is a mildly positive urine antigen test on Saturday. She was initially started on ciprofloxacin but later switched to acyclovir due to a yeast culture result. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.

3. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, and she is being treated with haloperidol and quetiapine.

4. Right Shoulder Rash:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. She is currently admitted to the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, agitation, dysphagia, tachycardia, hypertension, depression, and potential pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Pressure injuries: The patient's impaired mobility and neuromuscular weakness increase the risk of developing pressure injuries, particularly over bony prominences.

3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and neuromuscular weakness can increase the risk of developing DVT.

5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation can lead to delirium, which may complicate her clinical course.

6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's dysphagia and enteral feeding may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration pneumonia or constipation.

7. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 3-year-old female with a chief complaint of diarrhea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, wound infection, fever of unknown origin, ineffective coping, progressive neurologic decline, metabolic alkalosis, hypophosphatemia, dysphagia, respiratory failure, constipation, pneumonia, delirium/confusion, and constipation.

24-hour events show a rising WBC count. The patient is currently on several medications such as haloperidol (Haldol), antibiotics, and other ICU medications. Vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 77-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/60 to 85/69 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,141 mL and total output of 870 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 271 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 43.8 kg at admission"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old individual with a diagnosis of rapid dementia and associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease and requires mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of no known drug allergies and has been receiving various medications, including haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation and systemic heparin sodium as prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is mostly negative, except for respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, and wheeze. The patient also has a rash secondary to zoster infection on their right shoulder.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature (37.9°C), sinus tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 99%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Liver function tests are within normal limits, while kidney function tests show a slightly elevated creatinine level.

The patient's neurological examination reveals normal mental status and orientation. Motor strength is decreased in all extremities, and there is no sensory deficit or gait abnormality.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's critically ill condition with acute respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease poses a high risk for further complications. Some potential complications to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old individual with rapid dementia and associated ALS. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are all unchanged from admission except for the noted changes. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 106 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 120/72 to 138/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The ventilator settings include a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, and no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and normal heart sounds. Respiratory examination demonstrates clear breath sounds with no crackles or wheezes. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a left shift, elevated hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet count (Plt). Blood"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of rapid dementia and associated ALS. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, which is attributed to neuromuscular disease. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is also experiencing agitation related to anxiety, for which Haldol is being administered as needed.

The patient has a rash secondary to zoster on the right shoulder and has rapidly progressive dementia, which may or may not be distinct from the ALS. The patient's nutritional support is being provided through tube feeds, and he is awaiting long-term care facility placement.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's condition of acute respiratory failure could lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's neuromuscular disease and ALS may also result in complications related to muscle weakness and difficulty with swallowing, which can increase the risk of aspiration.

Additionally, the patient's dementia and agitation may contribute to increased risk of falls or injuries, and the presence of a rash due to zoster could potentially lead to secondary infections or postherpetic neuralgia.

Overall, the patient's critical illness and underlying conditions put him at risk for various complications that require close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia.
- The patient was admitted to the ICU and required intubation.
- She underwent a tracheostomy and was placed on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including Riluzole, Haldol, Quetiapine, Acyclovir, lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch, morphine, Sarna, PEG feeds, banana flakes, citalopram, and Seroquel.
- The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with frequent assessments of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results.
- The patient has shown improvement in some areas, such as resolution of tachycardia and hypertension, but continues to struggle with impaired respiratory function, delirium, and depression.
- The patient's medical team is planning to transfer her to a long-term care facility.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's neuromuscular weakness and effusion may lead to continued respiratory failure, especially while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Wound infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and recent tracheostomy, which increases the risk of developing wound infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurologic deterioration due to ALS and frontotemporal dementia. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation and tracheostomy. The patient is also experiencing agitation, dysphagia, depression, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of neuromuscular weakness and effusion. She is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and requires continued support.
2. Infection: The patient has been treated for suspected pneumonia, and her WBC count has shown some improvement. However, she is still at risk for infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium and confusion, which may be due to her underlying neurological condition or other factors such as medication side effects or infection.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and is at risk for developing further respiratory infections.
5. Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients, especially those receiving prolonged bed rest and certain medications.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Due to immobility, the patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's ability to"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with progressive neurological deterioration over the past 6 months due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She requires ICU admission and intubation, awaiting placement. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/77 mmHg to 85/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on ventilator support. 

She has been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff), pneumonia, constipation, dysphagia, and delirium. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and antiepileptic drugs. 

She is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for feeding. 

The patient's medical team plans to transfer her to a long-term care facility today, considering her chronic illness and need for ongoing supportive care."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old individual with a history of rapid dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's recent events include self-transferring from bed to a standing position. They are unable to provide their medical history due to encephalopathy. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/67 mmHg to 80/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal heart rhythm. The patient has symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and no murmurs or abnormal findings in the cardiovascular system. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, while other values such as sodium, potassium, and creatinine are within normal limits. 

The assessment and plan include acute respiratory failure attributed to neuromuscular disease, for which mechanical ventilation will be continued. The patient also has a rash post-zoster, rapidly progressive dementia, agitation due to anxiety, and requires nutritional support through tube feeding. The patient is awaiting long-term care facility placement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration due to ALS and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She was admitted to the ICU requiring intubation and tracheostomy placement. The patient has several medical problems including respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, delirium/confusion, and impaired motor function.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/63 mmHg to 167/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 255 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her respiratory support is being closely monitored, and she is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) initially, but it has been decreasing over the past week. Her hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count are within normal limits. Blood cultures have been negative so far, and she is being closely monitored for any signs of infection.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of progressive neurological deterioration due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and rapid progression of frontotemporal dementia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and intubated. She has a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/63 mmHg to 167/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and normal kidney function. The platelet count is slightly low.

The patient's physical examination reveals rales bilaterally in the lungs, regular rapid heart rate with second heart sound louder in the right upper sternal border, and strong peripheral pulses. Neurological examination shows impaired arousal, attention, cognition, balance, motor function, muscle performance, transfers, and ventilation. The skin examination is notable for impaired skin integrity.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, delirium/confusion, agitation, right shoulder rash (likely shingles), dysphagia, hypertension, depression/agitation, and wound infection.

The patient is currently being treated with supportive care,"

She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube on pressure support mode.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate between 78-112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74-110/53-89 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her current weight is 41.5 kg, which is slightly lower than her admission weight of 43.8 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 260 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, sodium level of 116 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose level of 151 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of infection at the tracheostomy site, but there are rhonchi bilaterally heard on auscultation. The patient's cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm with a slight murmur. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and a peg-tube is in place"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with rapid dementia and associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). No treatment is available for ALS, and the prognosis is poor.
- The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy.
- He had poor tolerance for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday, indicating low inspiratory pressure (IPS).
- The patient experienced transient ventricular bigeminy, which did not result in hemodynamic compromise or clinical consequences.
- The patient has a rash on the right shoulder following shingles (zoster).
- His dementia is rapidly progressive and presumed to be a distinct process from ALS.
- The patient has agitation due to anxiety and is given Haldol as needed.
- The patient's nutritional support is provided through tube feeding (TF) at goal.
- The patient has a positive PPD test and will have sputum AFB tested three times per rehabilitation request.
- The patient is anticipated to be transferred to a long-term care facility today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure persists due to neuromuscular disease. Mechanical ventilation will continue, with a plan to trial a tracheostomy collar.
2. Dementia: The patient has rapidly progressive dementia, presumed to be a distinct process from ALS. This condition may lead to cognitive decline and functional impairment.
3. RASH: The patient has a rash on the right shoulder following shingles"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof rapid dementia with associated ALS thus no treatment available
   and poor prognosis.
   ALS -- Predominately bulbar.  No available therapy available.  Arrange
   for discussion with family and Neurology service.
   ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to neuromuscular
   disease.  Continue mechanical ventilation --> work towards trach collar
   trial.
   RASH -- s/p Zoster right shoulder.
   DEMENTIA -- rapidly progressive, presumed distinct process from ALS.
   AGITATION  -- anxiety.  prn Haldol.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   +PPD -- will check sputum AFB x 3 per rehab.
   DISPOSITION [**Hospital **] transfer to  long-term care facility placement
   anticipated today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of rapid dementia and associated ALS. He is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure attributed to neuromuscular disease. The patient is mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and remains intubated. He has poor tolerance for spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and experiences transient ventricular bigeminy without hemodynamic compromise or clinical consequence.

The patient has a rash secondary to shingles on his right shoulder. His dementia is rapidly progressive and presumed to be a distinct process from ALS. He also exhibits agitation due to anxiety, for which haloperidol (Haldol) is administered as needed. The patient is receiving tube feeding (TF) at goal and requires nutritional support. Additionally, a PPD test will be conducted to check for sputum AFB x 3 per rehab.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/83 to 180/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His weight is currently 41.5 kg, and he has a height of 64 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,900 mL and output of 1,380 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 12.4 to 17.0 K/u"
