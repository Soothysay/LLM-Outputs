   Assessment and Plan
   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - attempt to wean Labetolol gtt
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   - check tox screen
   .
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain.
   - send peritoneal fluid for cell count, gram stain and culture
   - if cell counts look like SBP, will start Cipro
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   - add on lipase and amylase
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Pt currently undergoing
   HD due to recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to
   go back to PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - check Ca/Phos tomorrow
   - HD tomorrow
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds.
   - heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult in the AM
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   7. SLE:
   - continue Prednisone 20mg PO qday
   .
   8. FEN: regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   9. Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, no need for ulcer prophylaxis at this
   time, bowel regigmen

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) presenting with abdominal pain, headache, and malignant hypertension. She was admitted for hypertensive urgency. The differential diagnosis includes secondary hypertension due to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, or medication non-compliance. The patient denies drug use and had HD yesterday, so volume overload is less likely. Her blood pressure is elevated, and she is experiencing anxiety symptoms.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. Abdominal pain: The cause of the abdominal pain is still unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause. Possible complications include infection or bowel perforation.
3. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may contribute to her medical problems and could lead to medication non-compliance. It is important to address her anxiety to improve her overall well-being.
4. ESRD: The patient's kidney failure requires ongoing management, including regular HD sessions and monitoring of electrolyte levels.
5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient is receiving heparin, which can cause a decrease in platelet count. Monitoring her platelet levels is necessary to detect any potential complications.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT and is subtherapeutic on Coumadin. It is important to ensure appropriate anticoagulation to prevent further clot formation.
7. SLE: The patient's SLE requires ongoing management with medications such as Prednisone.
8. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be monitored closely to avoid complications like fluid overload or dehydration."

   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram stain negative for
   organisms.
   - consider starting SBP treatment per renal; will f/u renal recs
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results and per renal team
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Pt currently undergoing
   HD due to recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to
   go back to PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - HD today
   - renal following

   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds.
   - heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She presents with symptoms of hypertensive urgency, abdominal pain, and headache.

The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently undergoing hemodialysis (HD). She has a high blood pressure reading of 260/130 on arrival and is on multiple medications for hypertension, including labetalol, hydralazine, nifedipine, and clonidine. Despite medication adherence, her blood pressure remains elevated, indicating malignant hypertension.

The differential diagnosis for her hypertension includes secondary causes such as abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, and undiagnosed diseases. A toxicology screen has been done, which came back negative. Serum metanephrines are pending from her last admission.

The patient also has abdominal pain with an unrevealing extensive workup. A kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) study did not show any free air or evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO). Liver function tests (LFTs) are normal. The presence of polys in the cell count suggests a possible infection, but gram staining is negative for organisms.

The patient's ESRD is being managed with HD, and she is scheduled for three times a week. She was"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is undergoing dialysis. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with high blood pressure readings ranging from 160/111 to 220/139 mmHg. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 180s, indicating an infection. The patient has allergies to penicillins and experiences itching from Percocet.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain related to the indwelling PD catheter. The patient's physical examination reveals a distended abdomen and trace edema in both extremities. The patient's neurological assessment is not complete.

Lab results show elevated creatinine levels at 4.5 mg/dL, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 9.9 g/dL, likely due to ESRD. Other labs indicate elevated potassium levels and abnormal coagulation parameters.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hypertensive urgency and renal failure (ESRD). The plan includes continuing dialysis, monitoring for and treating potential complications such as abdominal pain and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is also being treated for depression and SVC thrombosis with appropriate medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's extremely high blood pressure readings"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hypertension presenting with hypertensive urgency. They have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and are currently undergoing dialysis. The patient also has an indwelling peritoneal dialysis catheter, which is causing abdominal pain and ascites with a white blood cell count of 180. No empirical antibiotics are being given at this time. The patient is already on prednisone for SLE, Celexa for depression, and coumadin for superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis with bridging heparin. The patient is anemic, likely due to ESRD, and will continue to be monitored. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: If not managed appropriately, it can lead to severe complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. ESRD: This is a chronic condition that can lead to various complications including fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased susceptibility to infections.
3. Abdominal pain and ascites: The presence of ascites indicates potential fluid accumulation in the abdomen, which may increase the risk of infection or lead to respiratory compromise if the lungs are compressed.
4. SVC thrombosis: If not properly managed, it can result in serious complications like pulmonary embolism"

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presented with
   abdominal pain and headache yesterday and was admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   #1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative. Blood
   pressure improved during MICU stay, although morning blood pressures
   today were elevated before patient received inpatient meds.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - attempt to wean Labetolol gtt
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - follow serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   #2Headache: R sided HA for several weeks, radiates to R jaw where
   patient had previous tooth extraction. Neg head ct, no focal neuro
   findings.  No visual deficits. HA did not improve w/blood pressure
   control so likely not part of hypertensive disease.
   -          Tylenol, PO dilaudid for pain.
   -          Consider neuro outpatient for HA management
   -          UE U/s (b/c of Hx of UE DVT and appears to have facial
   swelling)
   -          Thorough dental exam
   .
   #3. Abdominal Pain: Resolved this am.  Extensive prior workup
   unrevealing.  KUB done today without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs
   normal. Contributing to abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites
   with potential for SBP or infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did
   not show source of abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram
   stain negative for organisms.
   - renal did not recommend SBP treatment, should not pull PD catheter at
   this time.
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   .
   #4. ESRD: On T/Th/Sat HD schedule.  Pt currently undergoing HD due to
   recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to go back to
   PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - HD yesterday
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds. Heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin ->
   suptratherapeutic PTT.
   -d/c heparin (risk of hypertensive ich)
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   7. SLE:
   - continue Prednisone 20mg PO qday
   .
   8. FEN: regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   9. Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt d/c, no need for ulcer prophylaxis at this
   time, bowel regimen

","The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) presenting with abdominal pain, headache, and hypertension. The patient's blood pressure was initially elevated at 260/130, but improved during her stay in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). She continues to have elevated blood pressure readings.

The patient's medical history includes a previous DVT, anxiety, anemia, and SLE. She is currently taking multiple medications including labetalol, hydralazine, nifedipine, clonidine, Tylenol, dilaudid, Coumadin, and Celexa.

Her physical examination reveals a well-appearing African-American woman with a prosthetic eye, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and a midline scar on her abdomen. Cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with II/VI systolic ejection murmur best heard at the apex. Pulmonary examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Neurological examination shows normal mental status and intact cranial nerves.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 180 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 217,000/mm3, and elevated creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL. Troponin T is within"

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - attempt to wean Labetolol gtt
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   .
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram stain negative for
   organisms.
   - consider starting SBP treatment per renal; will f/u renal recs
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results and per renal team
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Pt currently undergoing
   HD due to recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to
   go back to PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - HD today
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds.
   - heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   7. SLE:
   - continue Prednisone 20mg PO qday
   .
   8. FEN: regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   9. Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, no need for ulcer prophylaxis at this
   time, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and malignant hypertension. She presented with abdominal pain and headache and was admitted for hypertensive urgency. The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but she has ongoing abdominal pain, anxiety, anemia related to ESRD, and a history of superior vena cava/brachiocephalic deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure.
2. Abdominal Pain: The cause of the abdominal pain remains undetermined. If left untreated, it could lead to further complications such as peritonitis or intestinal ischemia.
3. Anxiety: Uncontrolled anxiety can contribute to hypertension and non-compliance with medications. If not addressed, it may worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of further medical issues.
4. ESRD: The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESRD. Failure to manage her renal condition properly could result in worsening kidney function or electrolyte imbalances.
5. SVC/Brachiocephalic DVT: The patient has a history of DVT. If ant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hypertension who is currently admitted to the ICU for malignant hypertension. The patient has been experiencing a headache, facial swelling, and abdominal pain. They have a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic pain, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and depression.

Medical Complications:
1. Malignant hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, reaching levels of 210/130 mmHg. This can lead to organ damage and other complications if not managed promptly.
2. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, which means their kidneys are no longer functioning properly. This can result in the buildup of waste products and toxins in the body.
3. Ascites: The patient has fluid accumulation in the abdomen, as indicated by the presence of ascites. This may be related to liver dysfunction or other underlying conditions.
4. Surgical site infection: The patient has an indwelling peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter, and there is a concern for infection, as suggested by the elevated white blood cell count.
5. SVC thrombosis: The patient has a superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis, which can cause facial swelling and other symptoms.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to their ESRD. It is important to monitor and manage"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of malignant hypertension. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis, chronic pain in the upper extremity, hypertension, renal failure (end-stage renal disease), and tooth extraction. The patient's blood pressure is still elevated at 210/130 mmHg, despite not receiving their morning medications yet. They also have a headache, which they attribute to the recent tooth extraction. The patient has allergies to penicillins and Percocet, causing rashes. They are currently receiving multiple medications, including heparin sodium, Coumadin, Clonidine patch, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but their blood pressure remains high. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 977 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's lab results indicate elevated creatinine and potassium levels, along with an increased white blood cell count. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Malignant hypertension: The patient's extremely high blood pressure puts them at risk for complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.

2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function. If not managed properly, this could lead to further deterioration of renal function or the development of acute kidney"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hypertension who presented with malignant hypertension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of their condition.

Key Findings and Assessment:
- The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication, with readings ranging from 104-213 mmHg systolic and 87-130 mmHg diastolic.
- The patient is experiencing headaches, which could be due to a migraine or a dental abscess.
- The patient has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic pain, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and systemic vascular congestion (SVC) thrombosis.
- The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 5.8 K/uL.
- The patient's platelet count is within normal range at 217 K/uL.
- Kidney function tests show an increased creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL.
- Other lab results include elevated PT/PTT/INR, elevated CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, low calcium level, and normal magnesium and phosphate levels.
- The patient has been receiving various medications including Coumadin, Celexa, Hydralazine, Nifedipine, Labetalol, Clonidine patch, Prednisone, SC heparin, and others as needed.
- The patient's vital signs have been unstable with fluctuating blood pressure readings. Their heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation have been relatively stable.
- The patient has received dialysis and had some ascites removed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's persistently high blood pressure readings indicate a hypertensive crisis, which can lead to severe complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests ongoing renal dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by the hypertensive crisis.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and presence of ascites with an elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
4. Thrombosis: The patient's history of DVT and SVC thrombosis increases the risk of further thrombotic events.
5. Medication Side Effects: Some of the medications the patient is receiving may have potential side effects that need to be monitored.
6. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's ESRD and abnormal lab results suggest possible organ dysfunction, which requires ongoing monitoring and management.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessments and treatment planning."
