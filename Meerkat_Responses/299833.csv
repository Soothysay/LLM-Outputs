","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of syncope and fall, resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), facial/orbital fracture, and rib fracture. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing a fever without an identified source.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient may have unstable angina or coronary ischemia, as indicated by his syncope and potential NSTEMI.
3. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient has difficulty protecting his airway, which increases the risk of aspiration.
4. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH): The patient has a traumatic SAH, which requires close monitoring and management of blood pressure to prevent rebleeding.
5. Traumatic Facial/Ocular Fracture: The patient has a facial/orbital fracture, specifically a zygomatic arch fracture.
6. Rib Fracture: The patient also has a fracture of the left 4th rib.
7. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia, with large amounts of mucous production requiring frequent suctioning.
8. Gastrointestinal (GI)/Abdominal Issues: The patient has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed on November 4th.
9. Renal Issues:"
