","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly man with a history of multiple myeloma (MMM) who was admitted with hemoptysis. He has been transferred to the CCU for further management of congestive heart failure (CHF) and hypertension. The patient has chosen to be discharged to hospice care.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/65 to 182/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is paced at a heart rate of 69 bpm.

The patient is receiving nitroglycerin and furosemide (Lasix) infusions in the ICU. Other medications include metoprolol and morphine sulfate, which were administered on 2104-10-30 at 02:00 PM and 02:25 PM, respectively. Furosemide (Lasix) was given at 04:00 PM on the same day.

The patient has allergies to Xanax (Oral) and Ativan (Injection), both causing drowsiness and confusion.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for hemoptysis. The flowsheet data shows fluid balance with a net loss of 1,741 mL and urine output of 2,345 mL since 12 AM. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man admitted with hemoptysis, now transferred to the CCU for further care of heart failure and hypertension. He has chosen to be discharged to home with hospice care in the morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing fluid overload contributing to poor respiratory status. His blood pressure is controlled with nitroglycerin infusion and Lasix. The patient is refusing oral medications and has a history of allergies to Xanax and Ativan. He is on multiple medications including antibiotics, cardiac drugs, and pain relief. The patient's lab results show slightly elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and white blood cell count, but overall within normal range. The patient's condition is being managed with a focus on heart failure, hypertension, and comfort care. He has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's current fluid overload and poor respiratory status indicate potential worsening of his heart failure. This can lead to further respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, or acute decompensation.
2. Hypertensive crisis: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, there is a risk of hypertensive crisis due to his uncontrolled hypertension history. This can result in end-organ damage such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for"
