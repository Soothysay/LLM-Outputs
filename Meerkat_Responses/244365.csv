","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU for alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 109 bpm (with a range of 97-125 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 121/95 mmHg to 129/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (with a range of 19-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is sedated and sleeping, with no acute distress. There are sclera anicteric and ecchymoses over the mandible. The lungs show mild crackles bilaterally, while the cardiovascular examination shows a regular tachycardic heart rate with normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with present bowel sounds and no rebound tenderness or guarding. The extremities are warm, well perfused, with 2+ pulses and very chapped skin on the pedal aspect of the feet. The neurologic examination is consistent with sedation, with PERRL (pupils equal, round, and reactive to light), symmetric DTRs (deep tendon reflexes), and toes downgoing on Babinski.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 y/o M with hx of HTN and etoh abuse presents from trauma [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   service after bilateral mandibular fxs on [**7-19**] with etoh withdrawl and
   now new PNA, likely aspiration.  Now with respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and labile hemodynamics.
   .
   # ETOH withdrawl
 last drink was Friday [**7-19**], the day of his fall.  No
   known history, but likley heavy etoh use.  Went into severe withdrawl
   on [**7-21**] with hallucinations, delerium, hypertenison and tachycardia.
   Responded initially to IV ativan, but then continued to be hypertensive
   and tachycardic to 160s prior to intubation.  Delerious enough that he
   likely had aspiration pneumonia, so needed to protect airway
   - continue sedation with fentanyl and versed; ativan no longer being
   used
   - monitor for hemodynamic signs of withdrawl
   - wean sedation as tolerated by patient
   - folate, MVI, thiamine
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 not protecting airway due to aggiation and
   copious secretions, intubated [**7-22**].  Overnight vent settings needed to
   be titrated up for low O2 sats and low PcO2.  Responded well to
   increased PEEP and FiO2, decreased Vt as well.
   - continue to monitor, wean FiO2 as tolerated today
   - pneumonia treatment as below
   - consider early ARDS if patient respiratory status not improving
   .
   # Hypotension
 was moderately hypotensive overnight, although
   responsive to IVFs.  Likely due to total body fluid deficit as urine
   output was low, too.  Surprisingly, pt not tachycardic.  Also could
   have been related to oversedation in setting of new intubation.
   Overnight stabalized to SBPs around 100.
   - IVF boluses PRN
   - consider CVL placement
   - tx one [**Location **] for possible blood loss as cause
   - trended CEs, negative so far
   .
   # Pneumonia
 after having desats, CXR showed RLL pneumonia, likely
   aspiration.  Has been in hospital for >72 hrs and should be treated for
   HAP as well.  Was hypotensive overnight, although not tachycardic or
   febrile.  Pancultured, though.
   - vanco, cefepime, flagyl for treatment of HAP and aspiration
   - follow up cultures
   - intubation as above with goal to wean as tolerated
   .
   # Anemia
 likely due to blood loss in hematomas on chest and jaw,
   trending Hct
   - transfused one unit overnight
   - transfuse for hemodynamic instability of hct <21
   .
   # Mandibular Fx
 will need surgical repair at some point, will wait
   until other issues have stabalized.  Ortho team following along with
   plans for ORIF.
   - appreciate recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension and alcohol abuse who presented to the trauma service after sustaining bilateral mandibular fractures on July 19th. The patient has since developed ethanol withdrawal, respiratory failure, hypotension, and pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.

24-hour events:
- The patient has been withdrawing in the morning and receiving hourly doses of ativan.
- The patient desaturated around 9 AM, and a chest X-ray showed a new right lower lobe infiltrate.
- The patient was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration coverage.
- Sputum culture is pending.
- Around 2 PM, the patient had increasing agitation, heart rate in the 150s, and worsening oxygen saturation.
- The patient was successfully intubated.
- Vitals stabilized with heart rates in the 100s, blood pressures in the 100s on fentanyl and versed.
- Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) team does not want to take the patient to the operating room for mandibular fractures until stabilized.
- Overnight, the patient had low urine output and hypotension, responding to IV fluid boluses.
- Hematocrit trended down to 23, and the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells.
- The patient had desats and two arterial blood gas analyses showed low partial oxygen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of a fall and mandibular fractures. The patient has been experiencing increasing agitation, worsening oxygen saturation, and desaturation episodes. 

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and was found to have new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, suggestive of pneumonia. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl) for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration coverage.

The patient required intubation due to severe agitation and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs were stabilized with the use of fentanyl and versed. Oral intake was restricted due to the risk of aspiration.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures have been sent for analysis.

The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, low urine output, and worsening pneumonia. The patient received fluid boluses to address hypotension and transfusion of packed red blood cells due to a declining hematocrit level.

The patient's respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O. The patient's"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of a fall and mandibular fractures. The patient was found to have hypotension and was intubated due to worsening agitation and respiratory distress. The patient was diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia, for which vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl were started. The patient also has a history of alcohol withdrawal and is being treated with ativan. The patient's vital signs have been unstable, requiring fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with decreased urine output and low hemoglobin levels. The patient remains sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, with increasing difficulty in oxygenation. This may indicate a progression of the pneumonia or development of complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol use and is at risk for withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens. Close monitoring and appropriate management with benzodiazepines are essential.
3. Bleeding and coagulopathy: The patient has received blood products and has a low platelet count. This raises concerns for bleeding complications and the need for ongoing monitoring of coagulation parameters.
4. Kidney injury:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ethanol abuse who presented to the trauma service after sustaining bilateral mandibular fractures on [7-19]. He is experiencing alcohol withdrawal, likely heavy ethanol use, and developed severe withdrawal symptoms on [7-21] with hallucinations, delirium, hypertension, and tachycardia. He was initially treated with IV ativan but continued to be hypertensive and tachycardic prior to intubation. The patient also has respiratory failure requiring intubation and labile hemodynamics. He has pneumonia, likely aspiration, and is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. His anemia is likely due to blood loss from hematomas on his chest and jaw, and he is trending low Hct. The patient's mandibular fractures will require surgical repair at a later time once his other issues have stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of heavy ethanol use and is showing signs of severe withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations, delirium, hypertension, and tachycardia. If not properly managed, alcohol withdrawal can lead to complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and even death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a serious condition that requires immediate intervention. If left untreated, it can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia,"

   # ETOH withdrawl
 last drink was Friday [**7-19**], the day of his fall.  No
   known history, but likley heavy etoh use.  Went into severe withdrawl
   on [**7-21**] with hallucinations, delerium, hypertenison and tachycardia.
   Responded initially to IV ativan, but then continued to be hypertensive
   and tachycardic to 160s prior to intubation.  Delerious enough that he
   likely had aspiration pneumonia, so needed to protect airway
   - continue sedation with fentanyl and versed; ativan no longer being
   used
   - monitor for hemodynamic signs of withdrawl
   - wean sedation as tolerated by patient
   - folate, MVI, thiamine
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 not protecting airway due to aggiation and
   copious secretions, intubated [**7-22**].  Overnight vent settings needed to
   be titrated up for low O2 sats and low PcO2.  Responded well to
   increased PEEP and FiO2, decreased Vt as well.
   - continue to monitor, wean FiO2 as tolerated today
   - pneumonia treatment as below
   - consider early ARDS if patient respiratory status not improving
   .
   # Hypotension
 was moderately hypotensive overnight, although
   responsive to IVFs.  Likely due to total body fluid deficit as urine
   output was low, too.  Surprisingly, pt not tachycardic.  Also could
   have been related to oversedation in setting of new intubation.
   Overnight stabalized to SBPs around 100.
   - IVF boluses PRN
   - consider CVL placement
   - tx one [**Location **] for possible blood loss as cause
   - trended CEs, negative so far
   .
   # Pneumonia
 after having desats, CXR showed RLL pneumonia, likely
   aspiration.  Has been in hospital for >72 hrs and should be treated for
   HAP as well.  Was hypotensive overnight, although not tachycardic or
   febrile.  Pancultured, though.
   - vanco, cefepime, flagyl for treatment of HAP and aspiration
   - follow up cultures
   - intubation as above with goal to wean as tolerated
   .
   # Anemia
 likely due to blood loss in hematomas on chest and jaw,
   trending Hct
   - transfused one unit overnight
   - transfuse for hemodynamic instability of hct <21
   - abd CT to evaluate for bleed

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient, a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ethanol abuse, presented to the trauma service after sustaining bilateral mandibular fractures on July 19th.
- The patient is experiencing ethanol withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations, delirium, hypertension, and tachycardia.
- He was initially treated with IV ativan but continued to be hypertensive and tachycardic, requiring intubation for respiratory failure.
- The patient's respiratory distress necessitated intubation, and overnight ventilator settings were titrated to maintain adequate oxygenation.
- The patient also displayed hypotension, which was responsive to IV fluid boluses.
- A chest X-ray revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia, likely aspiration, and the patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) as well.
- The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss from the mandibular fractures and other potential sources, and a unit of packed red blood cells has been transfused.
- The patient's mandibular fractures will require surgical repair, but this will be done after stabilizing the patient's other medical issues.
- The patient is currently receiving nutrition via parenteral route, and his glycemic control is being monitored.
- The patient has multiple IV lines and is receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 y/o M with hx of HTN and etoh abuse presents from trauma [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   service after bilateral mandibular fxs on [**7-19**] with etoh withdrawl and
   now new PNA, likely aspiration.  Now with respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and labile hemodynamics.
   .
   # ETOH withdrawl
 last drink was Friday [**7-19**], the day of his fall.  No
   known history, but likley heavy etoh use.  Went into severe withdrawl
   on [**7-21**] with hallucinations, delerium, hypertenison and tachycardia.
   Responded initially to IV ativan, but then continued to be hypertensive
   and tachycardic to 160s prior to intubation.  Delerious enough that he
   likely had aspiration pneumonia, so needed to protect airway
   - continue sedation with fentanyl and versed; ativan no longer being
   used
   - monitor for hemodynamic signs of withdrawl
   - wean sedation as tolerated by patient
   - folate, MVI, thiamine
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 not protecting airway due to aggiation and
   copious secretions, intubated [**7-22**].  Overnight vent settings needed to
   be titrated up for low O2 sats and low PcO2.  Responded well to
   increased PEEP and FiO2, decreased Vt as well.
   - continue to monitor, wean FiO2 as tolerated today
   - pneumonia treatment as below
   - consider early ARDS if patient respiratory status not improving
   .
   # Hypotension
 was moderately hypotensive overnight, although
   responsive to IVFs.  Likely due to total body fluid deficit as urine
   output was low, too.  Surprisingly, pt not tachycardic.  Also could
   have been related to oversedation in setting of new intubation.
   Overnight stabalized to SBPs around 100.
   - IVF boluses PRN
   - consider CVL placement
   - tx one [**Location **] for possible blood loss as cause
   - trended CEs, negative so far
   .
   # Pneumonia
 after having desats, CXR showed RLL pneumonia, likely
   aspiration.  Has been in hospital for >72 hrs and should be treated for
   HAP as well.  Was hypotensive overnight, although not tachycardic or
   febrile.  Pancultured, though.
   - vanco, cefepime, flagyl for treatment of HAP and aspiration
   - follow up cultures
   - intubation as above with goal to wean as tolerated
   .
   # Anemia
 likely due to blood loss in hematomas on chest and jaw,
   trending Hct
   - transfused one unit overnight
   - transfuse for hemodynamic instability of hct <21
   .
   # Mandibular Fx
 will need surgical repair at some point, will wait
   until other issues have stabalized.  Ortho team following along with
   plans for ORIF.
   - appreciate recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the trauma service after suffering bilateral mandibular fractures on [7-19]. The patient is now experiencing alcohol withdrawal and has developed pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. He also has respiratory failure and requires intubation. His vital signs are unstable, and he has been hypotensive and tachycardic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of severe withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations, delirium, hypertension, and tachycardia. It is important to continue sedation with fentanyl and versed to manage these symptoms. Monitoring for hemodynamic signs of withdrawal is also crucial.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress indicates that he is not protecting his airway adequately, leading to aspiration pneumonia. Intubation and titration of ventilator settings have been done to improve oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide elimination. Weaning of FiO2 should be done as tolerated. Antibiotics have been started for pneumonia treatment.
3. Hypotension: The patient was moderately hypotensive overnight, possibly due to total body fluid deficit and oversedation. IVF boluses should be given as needed, and consideration should be given to CVL placement.
4. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia due to blood loss in hematomas on the chest and jaw."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse who was admitted to the MICU for presumed EtOH withdrawal. He was intubated for agitation and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, potential aspiration pneumonia, anemia, bilateral mandibular fractures, and a fall.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen levels require close monitoring and management of his ventilation support. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause is not adequately addressed.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's intubation and risk factors for aspiration, there is a possibility of developing aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening lung infection and sepsis if not promptly treated.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, which may be related to blood loss from the fall or dilutional effects due to fluid resuscitation. If left untreated, anemia can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. Bilateral mandibular fractures: These fractures require surgical intervention. However, considering the patient's active EtOH withdrawal, surgery may be deferred. Delayed treatment of fractures can lead to complications such as malunion or nonunion.

5. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's"
