   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of dyspnea. They have a history of allergies to certain medications and unknown reactions to morphine, Compazine, and Reglan. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on respiratory support but not using supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's blood work shows thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 40 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 6.6 mg/dL, low hemoglobin levels of 10.2 g/dL, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges. 

The patient's medical team is concerned about thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS/TTP), renal failure, anemia, hypertension, and psychiatric issues. They are awaiting blood bank and heme consult for pheresis, planning to make the patient NPO with an IR catheter pending. The patient will need fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to this procedure, and a Coombs test is pending. 

The patient is receiving methylprednisolone for HUS/TTP, as well as other medications for their other conditions."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of exertional dyspnea. They have been admitted to the ICU and seen by various medical teams. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications, including penicillins and morphine. They are currently on multiple infusions and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output. The patient's blood work reveals thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure. They have been diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS/TTP) and are receiving appropriate treatment. The patient also has potential graft rejection, for which pulse dose steroids have been administered. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is being considered. The patient's hypertension and anemia are also being managed accordingly. The patient's current condition is critical, and their disposition remains in the ICU pending stabilization of hematocrit (Hct) and platelets. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for several medical complications. These include worsening renal function, graft rejection, ongoing thrombocytopenia and associated bleeding risks, and potential complications related to the patient's critical condition such as infections or organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate management will be crucial to prevent and manage these potential"

   failure concerning for rejection.
   Plan:
   ## Suspected recurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura with
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
   - blood bank to discuss with hematology and nephrology about the role
   of plasmapheresis
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily, sirolimus 5 [**Hospital1 **] daily, MMF

   - trend CBC and LDH q8h
   - cont to hold valacyclovir
   - f/u blood cultures to r/o DIC/sepsis
   - direct Coomb's negative
   ## Acute on chronic renal insufficiency; concern that flare of
   thrombotic microangiopathy has caused a new, severe insult to her renal
   graft; unclear if abnormal diastolic blood flow to renal graft is
   consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy though it's certainly
   concerning for rejection; rising potassium and worsening metabolic
   acidosis are likely to prompt need for hemodialysis
   - renal input appreciated
   - IR to place left IJ pheresis line (with VIP port) following 2 units
   of FFP (goal INR 2.0) for likely hemodialysis +/- plasmapheresis
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily, sirolimus 5 mg daily, amd
   MMF 720 mg [**Hospital1 **] for presumed rejection
    ## Acute hemolytic anemia; as above; likely etiology of exertional
   dyspnea and tea-colored urine
   - Hct bumped appropriately to transfusion; symptoms improved
   - Guaiac stools
   - cont ferrous sulfate
   ## Anticardiolipin antibody syndrome
   - likely not safe to reverse INR below 2.0 for procedures
   - cont to hold warfarin
   - if plasmapheresis is initiated, will need IV heparin for therapeutic
   anticoagulation, though monitoring PTT while getting plasmapheresis has
   numerous logistical difficulties
   ## Depression/Anxiety: cont outpatient psych regimen
   ## HTN
   - cont amlodipine
   - convert metoprolol to short-acting in case of bleeding complication
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   ## Osteoporosis: cont calcium and vitamin D; hold bisphosphonate given
   renal failure

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of anticardiolipin antibody syndrome and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who underwent renal transplantation. Currently, she presents with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and is suspected to have recurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/61 mmHg to 176/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is being treated with methylprednisolone, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for presumed rejection. She also requires hemodialysis due to worsening metabolic acidosis and rising potassium levels.

Other assessments and plans include acute hemolytic anemia, anticardiolipin antibody syndrome, depression/anxiety, hypertension, and osteoporosis. The patient is being closely monitored for potential complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, and thrombotic microangiopathy"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment:
   54 year old woman with anticardiolipin antibody syndrome and prior
   thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD
   s/p renal transplant now with likely recurrent TTP/TMA and acute renal
   failure concerning for rejection.
   Plan:
   ## Suspected recurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura with
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
   - blood bank to discuss with hematology and nephrology about the role
   of plasmapheresis
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily, sirolimus 5 [**Hospital1 **] daily, MMF
   720 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend CBC and LDH q8h
   - cont to hold valacyclovir
   - f/u blood cultures to r/o DIC/sepsis
   - direct Coomb's negative
   ## Acute on chronic renal insufficiency; concern that flare of
   thrombotic microangiopathy has caused a new, severe insult to her renal
   graft; unclear if abnormal diastolic blood flow to renal graft is
   consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy though it's certainly
   concerning for rejection; rising potassium and worsening metabolic
   acidosis are likely to prompt need for hemodialysis
   - renal input appreciated
   - IR to place left IJ pheresis line (with VIP port) following 2 units
   of FFP (goal INR 2.0) for likely hemodialysis +/- plasmapheresis
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily, sirolimus 5 mg daily, amd
   MMF 720 mg [**Hospital1 **] for presumed rejection
    ## Acute hemolytic anemia; as above; likely etiology of exertional
   dyspnea and tea-colored urine
   - Hct bumped appropriately to transfusion; symptoms improved
   - Guaiac stools
   - cont ferrous sulfate
   ## Anticardiolipin antibody syndrome
   - likely not safe to reverse INR below 2.0 for procedures
   - cont to hold warfarin
   - if plasmapheresis is initiated, will need IV heparin for therapeutic
   anticoagulation, though monitoring PTT while getting plasmapheresis has
   numerous logistical difficulties
   ## Depression/Anxiety: cont outpatient psych regimen
   ## HTN
   - cont amlodipine
   - convert metoprolol to short-acting in case of bleeding complication
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   ## Osteoporosis: cont calcium and vitamin D; hold bisphosphonate given
   renal failure

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with anticardiolipin antibody syndrome and a history of thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She underwent renal transplantation and is now presenting with suspected recurrent TTP/TMA, acute renal failure, and concern for rejection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Suspected recurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a possible recurrence of TTP/TMA. Immediate intervention with plasmapheresis is being considered to manage this condition.
2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function appears to be worsening, possibly due to a flare of thrombotic microangiopathy causing further damage to her renal graft. There is also concern for rejection, indicated by abnormal diastolic blood flow to the renal graft. Rising potassium levels and worsening metabolic acidosis may necessitate hemodialysis.
3. Acute hemolytic anemia: The patient has anemia, likely caused by the same underlying etiology as her exertional dyspnea and tea-colored urine. Transfusion has been given to increase hematocrit and improve symptoms.
4. Anticardiolipin antibody syndrome: The patient has this condition, which makes it necessary to be cautious about reversing INR below 2"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. They have a history of allergies to certain medications, including penicillins and morphine. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure and respiratory rate. They are sedated and unresponsive. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,683 mL and output of 1,200 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently high. Laboratory results show abnormalities in kidney function, liver enzymes, and electrolyte levels. The patient is diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), renal failure, anemia, and hypertension. They are receiving multiple treatments, including plasma exchange, red blood cell transfusions, renal replacement therapy, and immunosuppressive medications. The patient's condition is critical. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is intubated and in the ICU, which increases the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding. Additionally, the low platelet count in TTP/HUS can also lead to bleeding complications.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a possibility of further deterioration, leading to acute kidney"

   (HUS/TTP)
    Plasmapheresis
currently on hold [**3-6**] to concern for lack of efficacy
   and her high bleeding risk per heme, blood bank.  Plan team meeting
   today.
   Transfuse for Hct < 25
   Currently off heparin, plan to hold anticoagulation for now.
   Methylprednisone 500/daily, ? increase dose
   FFP today in an attempt to normalize INR
   ##Respiratory Failure
 c/b refractory hypoxemia, likely secondary DAH.
   Continues on steroids. Currently on PC with PEEP of 18,   but abdominal
   distension. Check bladder preasure, esophageal balloon today, ?
   increase vent. Aggressive reverse coagulopathy.
   ##Renal Failure -
   Antidonor antibodies negative, now doubting rejection. . Renal
   following for possible RRT. Catheter placed today. . Sirolimus off.
   Myfotic 720 Oral [**Hospital1 **] will change IV.
   Hemolytic anemia - bumped appropriately, plan as above.
   Abdominal Distension
 Ab CT to eval ? bleed if vent setting
   stabilize.  Check bladder preasure, ?abdominal compartment syndrome.

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, the HPI mentions hemoptysis and intubation overnight due to refractory hypoxemia. The patient also has a history of abdominal ultrasound with Doppler, which was negative for portal clot.

Allergies include Keflex (Oral), Penicillins, Dicloxacillin, Morphine, Compazine (Oral), Reglan (Oral), and unknown reactions to these medications.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of Fentanyl and Midazolam. Other ICU medications include Furosemide, Methyprednisone, and possibly other medications as mentioned in the ""Other medications"" section.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results up to January 4th at 07:40 AM.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are intubated and sedated, with crackles in the respiratory/chest assessment. Abdominal examination shows a distended, firm, non-tender abdomen. Extremities have trace edema in both the right and left sides. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PT/PTT/"

   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
   See event notes from resident and attending for more detail. In brief
   as events unfolded our original assessment that pulmonary edema was the
   culprit was not correct and that in fact her increasing O2 requirement
   and eventual need for intubation was the product of pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Protamine, DDAVP, and FFP were given. Likely will benefit
   from additional FFP.
   --FFP this AM
   --follow coags
   --discuss with heme and blood bank and renal; current thinking is that
   plasma exchange may not be beneficial in this setting
   --dialysis later today--removal of some volume may help respiratory
   distress even if the ultimate cause is hemorrhage
   --low compliance likely secondary to blood in chest cavity and lung
   parenchyma.
   AUTOREACTIVE ANTIBODIES CAUSING HEMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS
   TTP-like syndrome but with normal ADAMTS-13 levels in a previous
   manifestation of this; she has both clotting and bleeding challenges.
   Pulmonary distress is the most important problem and the one we are
   taking pains to address immediately. In the meantime discussion of
   possible benefits of plasma exchange with heme, blood bank and renal,
   as above.
   --team meeting today

   RENAL FAILURE
   F/U renal recs. Cause of renal failure not immediately clear; but by
   verbal report, donor antibodies were negative, lessening the chance
   that rejection is the cause.
   - dialysis today
   - consider repeating renal U/S with doppler to eval interval
   progression at some point later this week
   ABDOMINAL DISTENSION
   Increased abdominal distension today. ?abdominal bleed vs possible
   effects of an abdominal clot; however the latter is made less likely by
   yesterday

The patient has allergies to Keflex, Penicillins, Dicloxacillin, Morphine, Compazine, Reglan, and an unknown reaction to these medications. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Furosemide.

The patient's review of systems shows fatigue, cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, dysuria, Foley, and no rash. The flowsheet data indicates vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values.

The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctiva pale, endotracheal tube, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, crackles on lung auscultation, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and distended extremities. The patient is attentive and responds to commands but is sedated, with warm skin. Neurological examination is not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The platelet count is decreased, and the total bilirubin is slightly elevated. Other lab values include prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio,"

   See event notes from resident and attending for more detail. In brief
   as events unfolded our original assessment that pulmonary edema was the
   culprit was not correct and that in fact her increasing O2 requirement
   and eventual need for intubation was the product of pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Protamine, DDAVP, and FFP were given. Likely will benefit
   from additional FFP.
   --FFP this AM
   --follow coags
   --discuss with heme and blood bank and renal; current thinking is that
   plasma exchange may not be beneficial in this setting
   --dialysis later today--removal of some volume may help respiratory
   distress even if the ultimate cause is hemorrhage
   --low compliance likely secondary to blood in chest cavity and lung
   parenchyma.

   possible benefits of plasma exchange with heme, blood bank and renal,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential complications that can arise:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement and need for intubation indicate acute respiratory failure. This could be secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage, as mentioned in the note.

2. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS): The presence of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), anemia, renal failure, and neurological symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of TTP/HUS. Further evaluation and management are required.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate acute kidney injury. This may be related to the underlying TTP/HUS or other factors such as blood loss.

4. Pulmonary edema: Initially suspected as the cause of respiratory distress, pulmonary edema was ruled out in favor of pulmonary hemorrhage. However, it is important to monitor for any signs or symptoms of fluid overload or worsening pulmonary edema.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has received protamine, DDAVP, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to address bleeding and coagulopathy. Continued monitoring of coagulation parameters and consideration of additional interventions may be necessary.

6. Autoreactive antibodies: The mention of autoreactive antibodies causing hematologic problems suggests an"

   - transfuse to keep HCT >25
   - if evidence of ongoing bleeding give FFP
   ## Acute on chronic renal insufficiency; concern that flare of
   thrombotic microangiopathy has caused a new, severe insult to her renal
   graft; unclear if abnormal diastolic blood flow to renal graft is
   consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of anticardiolipin antibody syndrome and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), who underwent renal transplantation. She presented with TMA and acute alveolar hemorrhage while on heparin therapy. The patient's current condition includes pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, anemia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, anticardiolipin antibody syndrome, depression/anxiety, hypertension, and osteoporosis.

The patient has been treated with fluid resuscitation, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and initiation of hemodialysis. She has received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), converted to total parental nutrition (TPN) due to intolerance to oral intake, and increased sedation to manage dysynchrony during ventilation. The patient's arterial line and pheresis catheter were inserted, and she is on various medications including methylprednisolone, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, amlodipine, metoprolol, and calcium/vitamin D supplementation.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient's acute alveolar hemorrhage may lead to worsening respiratory distress and further deterioration of lung function. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with a chief complaint of pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient is currently in the ICU and has undergone various interventions and procedures. 

The patient's medical history includes fever, anemia secondary to blood loss, ineffective coping, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS/TTP). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3Â°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 161/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes. 

The patient has received several medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, IVIG, and hemodialysis. 

The patient's physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, crackles in the chest, distended abdomen, warm skin, and stiff legs. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure due to decreased lung compliance and high plateau pressures, progression of acute renal failure, development of further thrombotic events, and the possibility of sepsis given the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with anticardiolipin antibody syndrome and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who underwent renal transplant. She presented with TMA and acute alveolar hemorrhage. The patient is off all anticoagulation and receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her chest X-ray improved today. The patient is ventilated for airway protection and is experiencing increasing peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs), suggesting poor airway compliance. She also has abdominal distention, likely due to volume overload, which has been addressed through dialysis. The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency and is at risk for graft rejection. She is receiving IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and holding on ATGam. Her blood pressure remains elevated, and she is on multiple medications for hypertension. The patient also has osteoporosis and depression/anxiety, which are being managed accordingly. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient's increasing PIPs and poor airway compliance indicate worsening pulmonary hemorrhage. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ventilatory support may need to be adjusted based on her changing respiratory parameters. Frequent ABG analysis and continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation are necessary.
3. Abdominal Distention: The patient's abdominal distention is likely due to volume"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with anticardiolipin antibody syndrome and prior
   thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD
   s/p renal transplant presenting with acute renal failure, and on
   heparin w/ acute pulmonary hemorrhage.
   Fever: in setting of intubation and respiratory failure
   -send sputum, blood, urine
   -empiric coverage with vanc/levo
   Pulmonary Hemorrhage: patient is off all anticoagulation. Patient is
   receiving FFP. Patient
s CXR improved today.
   -FFP if active bleeding
   -precipitant likely heparin
   - appreciate renal, blood bank, heme/onc recs
   Respiratory Failure: patient ventilated for airway protection, now with
   increasing PIPs suggestive of poor airway compliance perhaps due to
   overdistention. Patient pulmonary hemorrhage appears stable. A
   component of interstitial fluid on CXR may have been due to CHF in the
   setting of renal failure with volume overload.
   - follow bladder pressures
   - decrease PEEP
   - recheck esophageal balloon
   Abdominal Distention: appears to be related to volume in setting of
   renal failure
   - appreciate renal efforts and plans for daily dialysis
   -CT abd/pelvis if patient stable
   Anemia: Patient  with known acute hemolytic anemia with stable LDH over
   past 2 days, also with anemia d/t blood loss from pulmonary hemorrhage
   - Guaiac stools
   - cont ferrous sulfate
   - transfuse to keep HCT >25
   - if evidence of ongoing bleeding give FFP
   Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: graft damage due to thrombotic
   microangiopathy vs graft rejection. No donor antibodies, decreasing
   likelihood of rejection. Gave IVIG [**1-4**]. Minimal urine output O/N
   concerning for loss of graft.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil per home regimen
   - continue with HD
   - will need to consider if anticoagulation may be needed to rescue
   renal function !
   Thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura with microangiopathic hemolytic
   anemia. No plasmapheresis at this time
LDH falling. Did have fever, so
   could have component of sepsis, but not with septic physiology.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - trend CBC and LDH q8h
   - hold valacyclovir
   Anticardiolipin antibody syndrome: given pulmonary hemorrhage,
   reversing INR. Will be at risk to clot.
   - apprec heme/onc opinion re: when patient anticoagulation benefit
   outweighs bleeding risk
   Tremors/ Lower Ext Rigidity: maybe in the setting of infection or
   sedation, but concern given hx clotting/bleeding for central process.
   There are not focal findings
   - CT head
   Depression/Anxiety: cont outpatient psych regimen
   HTN
   - cont amlodipine
   - convert metoprolol back to PO and attempt to use gut
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   Osteoporosis: cont calcium and vitamin D; hold bisphosphonate given
   renal failure
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: high residuals yesterday in setting increased bladder
   pressure, pressure improved today restart PO meds and attempt to start

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of anticardiolipin antibody syndrome, prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent renal transplantation. She presents with acute renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been on heparin, but it has been discontinued due to the acute pulmonary hemorrhage. She is receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Her CXR has shown improvement.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and her platelet count is within normal range. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with elevated potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. Her blood glucose level is significantly elevated.

The patient's vital signs include a fever, elevated heart rate, and blood pressure. Her respiratory rate is increased, and her oxygen saturation is maintained at 99% with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, crackles in the lungs, and abdominal distention. She has trace edema in both lower extremities, but no cyanosis or clubbing. Her neurological status is sedated, with no motor or sensory deficits.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and medical history,"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan, written by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   [**Location (un) 5651**]. I would emphasize and add the following points: 54F ESRD s/p
   transplant, APLAS, MHA/TTP c/b respiratory failure and pulmonary
   hemorrhage as well as ARF. Anuric, HD yesterday.
   Exam notable for Tm 101 BP 160/80 HR 80 RR 34 with sat 99 on VAC 320x
   24 PEEP 21, FiO2 0.5 7.35/48/142. Lower extremities rigid with clonus.
   Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Abd is protruberant but less tense
   today. Labs notable for WBC 6.5K, HCT 21, K+ 5.7, Cr 6.5, PLTS 31, LDH
   1700. CXR with resolving infiltrates.
   Agree with plan to continue ARDS vent with slow PEEP wean for alveolar
   hemorrhage / ARDS and start antibiotics given possibility of
   superimposed pneumonia. We will treat volume overload and hypertension
   in the setting of ARF with continued HD with UF today. For her
   APLA/MHA/TTP, will continue pulse dose MP and again discuss the risks /
   benefits of plasma exchange with heme, renal and transfusion medicine.
   Renal failure may be related to thrombotic diathesis but no evidence of
   active GN on sediment. Will hold PO psych meds given clonus (as well as
   likely drug-induced ileus) and check head CT as able. Will also discuss
   with family, renal transplant and heme re plan for possible
   anticoagulation going forward given APLAS, but the combination of
   active bleeding and ongoing pulmonary hemorrhage due to coagulopathy
   and uremic platelet dysfunction make heparin too risky to resume now.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 50 min
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a kidney transplant. She is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS). The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary hemorrhage, blood loss, and anemia. She is heavily sedated, making it difficult to assess her neurologic status. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has hypertension and fluid overload. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, potassium levels, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy to manage acute lung injury. She is also receiving hemodialysis and being considered for plasma exchange. The medical team is discussing the risks and benefits of anticoagulation given her history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and ongoing bleeding. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hemorrhage and acute lung injury - The patient's respiratory failure is due to acute lung injury caused by pulmonary hemorrhage. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Acute renal failure - The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately. There is a risk of fluid"

   DRAFT IN PROGRESS NOTE
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   FEVER
   Afebrile more recently. We are following up cultures. Fever emerged in
   the setting of acute pulmonary hemorrhage and may be the result of the
   acute inflammatory events that followed; however, underlying infection
   remains a possibility and we are covering with vancomycin and
   Levofloxacin.
   - f/u cultures
   - define vanco/levo course as 10 days until further evidence of source
   emerges; could consider peeling off vanco in advance of this if no
   positive evidence of infection
   PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE / BLEEDING DISORDER
   Patient is off all anticoagulation. Initial precipitant was likely
   starting heparin in the setting of baseline bleeding risk because of
   hematologic disorders; no evidence of further bleeding; x-ray is
   improving
   -Heme/onc recommends total of 100 g IVIG, feels plasmapheresis
   risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of necessary anticoagulation
   -We are completing IVIG today with final dose of 30 g
   -Appreciate the involvement and recommendations of renal, hematology
   and blood bank services
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Pulmonary hemorrhage and inflammation likely to be major source of her
   respiratory compromise. Resorption of blood and resolution of
   inflammation will hopefully lead to being able to wean; appears to be
   too early to expect this yet. No evidence of further major bleeding per
   RTs and RNs.
   - Poor compliance and high PEEP requirement;
   - will try to dial down FiO2 as a starting point,
   - esophageal balloon assessment earlier suggested need for elevated
   PEEP, likely will need reassessment later today or tomorrow if pt is
   tolerating decreases in FiO2
   ABDOMINAL DISTENSION
   CT scan shows no clear intraabdominal pathology, formal read is
   pending, will f/u; for now no intervention, follow exam; other members
   of MICU team felt distension had actually improved so if there is
   worsening it is not dramatic.
   - f/u CT
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH declining, reassuring.
   Some blood loss from hemorrhage.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy vs graft rejection; per
   renal, rejection is less likely given no donor antibodies. Minimal
   urine output continuing.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - changed to 50 mg prednisone daily
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. No plasmapheresis at this
   time
LDH falling, bleeding risk creates more risk than benefit for TPE.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - trend CBC and LDH q8h
   - apprec heme/onc opinion re: when patient anticoagulation benefit
   outweighs bleeding risk
   TREMORS/LOWER EXTREMITY RIGIDITY. Appreciate neurology consult and
   recs. CT shows edema, no clear focal lesion. MRI of head and spine
   would be ideal; pt not stable enough at this point to transport to MRI.
   Depression/Anxiety: hold psych meds for now to simplify regimen
   HYPERTENSION. Increasing hypertension; pt has baseline htn; important
   to control in setting of acute bleeding, ?neuro pathology.
   - cont amlodipine
   - adding on hydralazine
   - went back to IV with metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   - monitor correlation of HR and BP; discordant relationship would raise
   concern for cerebral process
   - goal BP <150

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who has undergone renal transplantation. She presented with new acute renal failure, acute pulmonary hemorrhage, and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient also has a bleeding disorder, anemia, abdominal distension, and a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary hemorrhage and inflammation may lead to ongoing respiratory compromise. It will be important to monitor her oxygenation levels and PEEP requirements.
2. Bleeding Disorder: The patient has a bleeding disorder due to her underlying hematologic disorders. Close monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and blood product transfusions will be necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute hemolytic anemia, which requires close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and blood counts. Blood transfusions may be needed to maintain an adequate hematocrit level.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure superimposed on chronic renal failure. This requires careful management of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal replacement therapy.
5. Thrombotic Disorder with Hemolytic Anemia: The patient has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, which requires close monitoring of blood counts, LDH levels, and plate"

   DRAFT IN PROGRESS NOTE
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   FEVER
   Afebrile more recently. We are following up cultures. Fever emerged in
   the setting of acute pulmonary hemorrhage and may be the result of the
   acute inflammatory events that followed; however, underlying infection
   remains a possibility and we are covering with vancomycin and
   Levofloxacin.
   - f/u cultures
   - define vanco/levo course as 10 days until further evidence of source
   emerges; could consider peeling off vanco in advance of this if no
   positive evidence of infection
   PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE:
   Patient is off all anticoagulation.
   -Heme/onc recommends ongoing IVIG, feels plasmapheresis risk/benefit
   has too great a risk b/c of necessary anticoagulation; recommends [**2-3**]
   g/kg
   -FFP if active bleeding
   -precipitant likely heparin
   - appreciate renal, blood bank, heme/onc recs
   Respiratory Failure: patient ventilated for airway protection, now with
   increasing PIPs suggestive of poor airway compliance perhaps due to
   overdistention. Patient pulmonary hemorrhage appears stable. A
   component of interstitial fluid on CXR may have been due to CHF in the
   setting of renal failure with volume overload.
   - follow bladder pressures
   - decrease PEEP
   - recheck esophageal balloon
   Abdominal Distention: appears to be related to volume in setting of
   renal failure
   - appreciate renal efforts and plans for daily dialysis
   -CT abd/pelvis if patient stable
   Anemia: Patient  with known acute hemolytic anemia with stable LDH over
   past 2 days, also with anemia d/t blood loss from pulmonary hemorrhage
   - Guaiac stools
   - cont ferrous sulfate
   - transfuse to keep HCT >25
   - if evidence of ongoing bleeding give FFP
   Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: graft damage due to thrombotic
   microangiopathy vs graft rejection. No donor antibodies, decreasing
   likelihood of rejection. Gave IVIG [**1-4**]. Minimal urine output O/N
   concerning for loss of graft.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil per home regimen
   - continue with HD
   - will need to consider if anticoagulation may be needed to rescue
   renal function !
   Thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura with microangiopathic hemolytic
   anemia. No plasmapheresis at this time
LDH falling. Did have fever, so
   could have component of sepsis, but not with septic physiology.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - trend CBC and LDH q8h
   - hold valacyclovir
   Anticardiolipin antibody syndrome: given pulmonary hemorrhage,
   reversing INR. Will be at risk to clot.
   - apprec heme/onc opinion re: when patient anticoagulation benefit
   outweighs bleeding risk
   Tremors/ Lower Ext Rigidity: see re neuro note; edema on head ct; rec
   f.u imaging; pt not stable enough for MRI yet
   - MRI
   Depression/Anxiety: hold psych meds for now to simplify regimen
   HTN
   - cont amlodipine
   - went back to IV with metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   - monitor correlation of HR and BP; discordant relationship would raise
   concern for cerebral process
   Osteoporosis: cont calcium and vitamin D; hold bisphosphonate given
   renal failure

   starting heparin; no evidence of further bleeding; x-ray is improving

   risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of necessary anticoagulation
   -We are completing IVIG today with final dose of 30 g
   -Appreciate the involvement and recommendations of renal, hematology
   and blood bank services
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Pulmonary hemorrhage and inflammation likely to be major source of her
   respiratory compromise. Resorption of blood and resolution of
   inflammation will hopefully lead to being able to wean; appears to be
   too early to expect this yet. No evidence of further major bleeding per
   RTs and RNs. Poor airway compliance and high PEEP requirement; will try
   to dial down FiO2 as a starting point, esophageal balloon assessment
   earlier suggested need for elevated PEEP, likely will need reassessment
   later today or tomorrow if tolerating FiO2 decreases.
   Abdominal Distention: appears to be related to volume in setting of
   renal failure

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, presented with new acute renal failure. The patient also experienced acute pulmonary hemorrhage while starting heparin after discontinuing warfarin.

The patient's fever has been monitored, and cultures have been obtained. She is being covered with vancomycin and Levofloxacin. The initial precipitant of the pulmonary hemorrhage was likely starting heparin, but there is no evidence of further bleeding, and the chest X-ray is improving. The recommendation is to complete IVIG today with a final dose of 30 g.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pulmonary hemorrhage and inflammation. Resorption of blood and resolution of inflammation will hopefully lead to weaning from mechanical ventilation. No evidence of further major bleeding has been observed, and poor airway compliance and high PEEP requirement indicate the need for reassessment later today or tomorrow if tolerating FiO2 decreases.

Abdominal distention appears to be related to volume in the setting of renal failure. A CT abdomen/pelvis is recommended if the patient is stable. The patient has known acute hemolytic anemia with stable lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) over the past two days, as well as anemia due to"

   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   FEVER
   Afebrile more recently. We are following up cultures. Fever emerged in
   the setting of acute pulmonary hemorrhage and may be the result of the
   acute inflammatory events that followed; however, underlying infection
   remains a possibility and we are covering with vancomycin and
   Levofloxacin.

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Poor airway compliance and high PEEP requirement; will try to dial down
   FiO2 as a starting point, esophageal balloon assessment earlier
   suggested need for elevated PEEP; picture is consistent with poor
   compliance
   Respiratory Failure: patient ventilated for airway protection, now with
   increasing PIPs suggestive of poor airway compliance perhaps due to
   overdistention. Patient pulmonary hemorrhage appears stable. A
   component of interstitial fluid on CXR may have been due to CHF in the
   setting of renal failure with volume overload.
   - follow bladder pressures
   - decrease PEEP
   - recheck esophageal balloon
   Abdominal Distention: appears to be related to volume in setting of
   renal failure

   DRAFT IN PROGRESS NOTE
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   FEVER
   Afebrile more recently. We are following up cultures. Fever emerged in
   the setting of acute pulmonary hemorrhage and may be the result of the
   acute inflammatory events that followed; however, underlying infection
   remains a possibility and we are covering with vancomycin and
   Levofloxacin.
   - f/u cultures
   - define vanco/levo course as 10 days until further evidence of source
   emerges; could consider peeling off vanco in advance of this if no
   positive evidence of infection
   PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE:
   Patient is off all anticoagulation. Initial precipitant was likely
   starting heparin; no evidence of further bleeding; x-ray is improving
   -Heme/onc recommends total of 100 g IVIG, feels plasmapheresis
   risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of necessary anticoagulation
   -We are completing IVIG today with final dose of 30 g
   -Appreciate the involvement and recommendations of renal, hematology
   and blood bank services
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Poor airway compliance and high PEEP requirement
   Respiratory Failure: patient ventilated for airway protection, now with
   increasing PIPs suggestive of poor airway compliance perhaps due to
   overdistention. Patient pulmonary hemorrhage appears stable. A
   component of interstitial fluid on CXR may have been due to CHF in the
   setting of renal failure with volume overload.
   - follow bladder pressures
   - decrease PEEP
   - recheck esophageal balloon
   Abdominal Distention: appears to be related to volume in setting of
   renal failure
   - appreciate renal efforts and plans for daily dialysis
   -CT abd/pelvis if patient stable
   Anemia: Patient  with known acute hemolytic anemia with stable LDH over
   past 2 days, also with anemia d/t blood loss from pulmonary hemorrhage
   - Guaiac stools
   - cont ferrous sulfate
   - transfuse to keep HCT >25
   - if evidence of ongoing bleeding give FFP
   Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: graft damage due to thrombotic
   microangiopathy vs graft rejection. No donor antibodies, decreasing
   likelihood of rejection. Gave IVIG [**1-4**]. Minimal urine output O/N
   concerning for loss of graft.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil per home regimen
   - continue with HD
   - will need to consider if anticoagulation may be needed to rescue
   renal function !
   Thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura with microangiopathic hemolytic
   anemia. No plasmapheresis at this time
LDH falling. Did have fever, so
   could have component of sepsis, but not with septic physiology.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - trend CBC and LDH q8h
   - hold valacyclovir
   Anticardiolipin antibody syndrome: given pulmonary hemorrhage,
   reversing INR. Will be at risk to clot.
   - apprec heme/onc opinion re: when patient anticoagulation benefit
   outweighs bleeding risk
   Tremors/ Lower Ext Rigidity: see re neuro note; edema on head ct; rec
   f.u imaging; pt not stable enough for MRI yet
   - MRI
   Depression/Anxiety: hold psych meds for now to simplify regimen
   HTN
   - cont amlodipine
   - went back to IV with metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   - monitor correlation of HR and BP; discordant relationship would raise
   concern for cerebral process
   Osteoporosis: cont calcium and vitamin D; hold bisphosphonate given
   renal failure

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid syndrome and previous thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who has undergone renal transplantation. She presents with acute renal failure, acute pulmonary hemorrhage, and other complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to graft damage caused by thrombotic microangiopathy or graft rejection. Close monitoring of urine output and daily dialysis is recommended.

2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient has experienced pulmonary hemorrhage, which initially occurred as a result of starting heparin therapy. She is currently off all anticoagulation, and there is no evidence of further bleeding. It is important to follow up with imaging and consider additional interventions as needed.

3. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): The patient has a history of TTP, which is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, fever, and neurological symptoms. Close monitoring of CBC and LDH levels is recommended.

4. Infection: The patient has a fever, and cultures have been obtained. There is a possibility of an underlying infection, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered.

5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and antihyp"

   DRAFT IN PROGRESS NOTE
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c

   the setting of acute pulmonary hemorrhage and may be the result of the
   acute inflammatory events that followed; however, underlying infection
   remains a possibility and we are covering with vancomycin and

   - f/u cultures
   - define vanco/levo course as 10 days until further evidence of source
   emerges; could consider peeling off vanco in advance of this if no
   positive evidence of infection
   PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE / BLEEDING DISORDER
   Patient is off all anticoagulation. Initial precipitant was likely
   starting heparin in the setting of baseline bleeding risk because of
   hematologic disorders; no evidence of further bleeding; x-ray is
   improving
   -Heme/onc recommends total of 100 g IVIG, feels plasmapheresis
   risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of necessary anticoagulation
   -We are completing IVIG today with final dose of 30 g
   -Appreciate the involvement and recommendations of renal, hematology
   and blood bank services
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Pulmonary hemorrhage and inflammation likely to be major source of her
   respiratory compromise. Resorption of blood and resolution of
   inflammation will hopefully lead to being able to wean; appears to be
   too early to expect this yet. No evidence of further major bleeding per
   RTs and RNs.
   - Poor compliance and high PEEP requirement;
   - will try to dial down FiO2 as a starting point,
   - esophageal balloon assessment earlier suggested need for elevated
   PEEP, likely will need reassessment later today or tomorrow if pt is
   tolerating decreases in FiO2
   ABDOMINAL DISTENSION
   CT scan shows no clear intraabdominal pathology, formal read is
   pending, will f/u; for now no intervention, follow exam; other members
   of MICU team felt distension had actually improved so if there is
   worsening it is not dramatic.
   - f/u CT
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH declining, reassuring.
   Some blood loss from hemorrhage.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy vs graft rejection; per
   renal, rejection is less likely given no donor antibodies. Minimal

   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - changed to 50 mg prednisone daily
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. No plasmapheresis at this
   time
LDH falling, bleeding risk creates more risk than benefit for TPE.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - trend CBC and LDH q8h
   - apprec heme/onc opinion re: when patient anticoagulation benefit
   outweighs bleeding risk
   TREMORS/LOWER EXTREMITY RIGIDITY. Appreciate neurology consult and
   recs. CT shows edema, no clear focal lesion. MRI of head and spine
   would be ideal; pt not stable enough at this point to transport to MRI.
   Depression/Anxiety: hold psych meds for now to simplify regimen
   HYPERTENSION. Increasing hypertension; pt has baseline htn; important
   to control in setting of acute bleeding, ?neuro pathology.
   - cont amlodipine
   - adding on hydralazine
   - went back to IV with metoprolol to ensure absorption; I am a bit
   concerned about too much rate blocking as if she opens up in terms of
   bleeding she may need this rate; I am inclined to use non-blocking
   agents for hypertension control if we need to increase dosing
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   - monitor correlation of HR and BP; discordant relationship would raise
   concern for cerebral process
   - goal BP <150

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who presented with acute renal failure and acute pulmonary hemorrhage. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has received multiple blood transfusions. The patient has anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia. She is also experiencing hypertension, tremors, and lower extremity rigidity. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory compromise is likely due to pulmonary hemorrhage and inflammation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the patient develops another episode of bleeding or if there is worsening of the pulmonary condition.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute hemolytic anemia, which can be exacerbated by blood loss from hemorrhage. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of transfusions may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with minimal urine output. This requires careful monitoring of renal function and consideration of interventions such as dialysis.
4. Thrombotic Disorder: The patient has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, which can lead to complications such as thrombosis or embolism. Monitoring of coagulation"

   DRAFT IN PROGRESS NOTE
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   FEVER
   Afebrile more recently. We are following up cultures. Fever emerged in
   the setting of acute pulmonary hemorrhage and may be the result of the
   acute inflammatory events that followed; however, underlying infection
   remains a possibility and we are covering with vancomycin and
   Levofloxacin.
   - f/u cultures
   - define vanco/levo course as 10 days until further evidence of source
   emerges; could consider peeling off vanco in advance of this if no
   positive evidence of infection
   PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE:
   Patient is off all anticoagulation. Initial precipitant was likely
   starting heparin; no evidence of further bleeding; x-ray is improving
   -Heme/onc recommends total of 100 g IVIG, feels plasmapheresis
   risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of necessary anticoagulation
   -We are completing IVIG today with final dose of 30 g
   -Appreciate the involvement and recommendations of renal, hematology
   and blood bank services
   Respiratory Failure: patient ventilated for airway protection, now with
   increasing PIPs suggestive of poor airway compliance perhaps due to
   overdistention. Patient pulmonary hemorrhage appears stable. A
   component of interstitial fluid on CXR may have been due to CHF in the
   setting of renal failure with volume overload.
   - follow bladder pressures
   - decrease PEEP
   - recheck esophageal balloon
   Abdominal Distention: appears to be related to volume in setting of
   renal failure
   - appreciate renal efforts and plans for daily dialysis
   -CT abd/pelvis if patient stable
   Anemia: Patient  with known acute hemolytic anemia with stable LDH over
   past 2 days, also with anemia d/t blood loss from pulmonary hemorrhage
   - Guaiac stools
   - cont ferrous sulfate
   - transfuse to keep HCT >25
   - if evidence of ongoing bleeding give FFP
   Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: graft damage due to thrombotic
   microangiopathy vs graft rejection. No donor antibodies, decreasing
   likelihood of rejection. Gave IVIG [**1-4**]. Minimal urine output O/N
   concerning for loss of graft.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil per home regimen
   - continue with HD
   - will need to consider if anticoagulation may be needed to rescue
   renal function !
   Thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura with microangiopathic hemolytic
   anemia. No plasmapheresis at this time
LDH falling. Did have fever, so
   could have component of sepsis, but not with septic physiology.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily
   - trend CBC and LDH q8h
   - hold valacyclovir
   Anticardiolipin antibody syndrome: given pulmonary hemorrhage,
   reversing INR. Will be at risk to clot.
   - apprec heme/onc opinion re: when patient anticoagulation benefit
   outweighs bleeding risk
   Tremors/ Lower Ext Rigidity: see re neuro note; edema on head ct; rec
   f.u imaging; pt not stable enough for MRI yet
   - MRI
   Depression/Anxiety: hold psych meds for now to simplify regimen
   HTN
   - cont amlodipine
   - went back to IV with metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   - monitor correlation of HR and BP; discordant relationship would raise
   concern for cerebral process
   Osteoporosis: cont calcium and vitamin D; hold bisphosphonate given
   renal failure

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who presented with new acute renal failure and acute pulmonary hemorrhage after starting heparin and discontinuing warfarin. She has multiple medical complications including hypertension, alteration in tissue perfusion, anemia, ineffective coping, renal failure, respiratory failure, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), fever, and osteoporosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, receiving IVIG and plasmapheresis for TTP/HUS, and undergoing daily dialysis for renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient's acute pulmonary hemorrhage may be related to starting heparin therapy. She is off all anticoagulation, and there is no evidence of further bleeding. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is ventilated for airway protection and has increasing peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) suggestive of poor airway compliance. This may be due to overdistention or other factors. Decreasing PEEP and rechecking esophageal balloon placement should be considered.

","The patient initially presented with dyspnea and was found to have pulmonary hemorrhage and coagulopathy. The patient's condition has been managed in the ICU with various interventions. 

During the 24-hour period, the patient's PEEP was decreased from 21 to 16, then back up to 18. There was an episode of desaturation overnight that responded to increased sedation. The patient also experienced agitation and hypertension, which continued even after advancing the endotracheal tube 2 cm. Propofol was added, and the patient's PEEP/FiO2 was increased.

A CT head was performed due to concerns of early cerebral edema, but the neurology team did not find any acute concerns for edema. They recommended an MRI head, C-, T-, and L-spine to evaluate spasticity. The patient received additional IVIG and 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Anti-hypertensives were titrated, and psychiatric medications were held.

The patient has multiple allergies, including keflex, penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, Compazine, and Reglan. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and levofloxacin. The patient is currently on infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole, metoprolol, and hydralazine.

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure
   ARDS in the setting of presumed DAH/aspiration. Likely going need
   ventilatory support for some day. Cont. Vt 6cc/Kg , PEEP 16-18. Wean
   fi02 for paO2 > 60. Once fi02 > 0.4
   can attemot to wean PEEP. Will likely need sig. sedation
   Renal Failure -
   HD as per renal. Now thought secondary to TMA. Will need to
   re-institute anticoagulation when confidant that lung injury has
   somewhat resolved.
   Cont. metheypred, cyclosporine
   Anemia -
   Transfuse for Hct < 25 - anemia likely also secondary to TMA.
   Additional IvIg today.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS, likely secondary to presumed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) or aspiration. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 320 mL, PEEP set at 18 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 60%. The patient's blood gases show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 128 and is being closely monitored for any changes.

The patient also has renal failure, which is being treated with hemodialysis (HD) and the re-institution of anticoagulation once lung injury has resolved. The patient is anemic with a hematocrit (Hct) level below 25% and will require a blood transfusion. Additionally, the patient has thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), for which additional IV Ig will be administered.

Other care measures include nutrition, with plans to start tube feeds today, and glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a pheresis catheter, arterial line, and central venous catheter. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure
   ARDS in the setting of presumed DAH/aspiration. Likely going need
   ventilatory support for some day. Cont. Vt 6cc/Kg , PEEP 16-18. Wean
   fi02 for paO2 > 60. Once fi02 > 0.4
   can attemot to wean PEEP. Will likely need sig. sedation
   Renal Failure -
   HD as per renal. Now thought secondary to TMA. Will need to
   re-institute anticoagulation when confidant that lung injury has
   somewhat resolved.
   Cont. metheypred, cyclosporine
   Anemia -
   Transfuse for Hct < 25 - anemia likely also secondary to TMA.
   Additional IvIg today.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to presumed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) or aspiration. The patient requires ventilatory support and will likely need it for some time. The plan is to wean the tidal volume to 6 cc/kg, maintain PEEP at 16-18 cmH2O, and gradually decrease FiO2 as PaO2 improves. Sedation will be significant due to the need for ventilatory support.

The patient also has renal failure, which is being treated with hemodialysis (HD). This is now believed to be secondary to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Anticoagulation will be re-instituted once lung injury has somewhat resolved. The patient will continue on methyprednisolone and cyclosporine.

Additionally, the patient has anemia, likely also secondary to TMA. A transfusion will be given for a hematocrit (Hct) less than 25. The patient will also receive intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) today.

In terms of ICU care, the patient will start tube feeds today, with regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines in place, including apheresis catheter, arterial line, and central venous catheter.

Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots, stress ulcer prevention with a proton"

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   Related to renal failure, currently well controlled on IV TNG. Stable
   now, will want to transition to intermittent agents. ?Captopril.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   Transfuse for Hct < 25
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely [**3-6**] TMA, holding anticoagulation pending improvement in lung
   injury.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Lung injury likely secondary to aspirated blood. Oxygenation seems much
   improved today. Wean fi02 to 0.40, then start weaning PEEP.
 THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA / HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) / Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): The patient has low platelet count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal kidney function, which are indicative of TTP/HUS.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory distress, likely caused by lung injury from aspirated blood.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by abnormal electrolyte levels and elevated creatinine.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (Hct) level, indicating anemia, likely secondary to blood loss.

5. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure, which is related to renal failure.

6. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is experiencing poor intestinal mobility, making it difficult to provide adequate nutrition through oral intake.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   Still poor intestinal mobility. Will check KUB and then start reglan
   and po narcan if no sign of obstruction.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   Related to renal failure, currently well controlled on IV TNG. Stable
   now, will want to transition to intermittent agents. ?Captopril.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   Transfuse for Hct < 25
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely [**3-6**] TMA, holding anticoagulation pending improvement in lung
   injury.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Lung injury likely secondary to aspirated blood. Oxygenation seems much
   improved today. Wean fi02 to 0.40, then start weaning PEEP.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have a history of poor intestinal mobility, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and a potential risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS).

24-hour events include a negative preliminary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a seizure overnight, and ongoing issues with nutrition and gastrointestinal motility. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.9Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-143/66-92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient is on multiple medications including fentanyl, nitroglycerin, metoprolol, lorazepam, and hydralazine. They have allergies to cephalexin, penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, compazine, and reglan. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes.

Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition due to poor intestinal mobility, hypertension related to renal failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and a concern for TTP/HUS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient has a history of allergies to Keflex, penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, Compazine, Reglan, and unknown reactions to these medications. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient is on multiple infusions including Fentanyl, Nitroglycerin, Metoprolol, Lorazepam, and Hydralazine. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of an OG/NG tube and being NPO.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-143/66-77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 320 mL, respiratory rate set at 34 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 406 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 11.4 L/min. The patient's platelet count is low at 43 K/uL, hemoglobin level is 9.3 g/dL, white blood cell count is 7.3 K/uL, and creatinine level is elevated at 4.8 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals increased tone and a distended abdomen. The patient's labs show elevated levels of lactate, lactic acid, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges.

The patient has several medical complications including hypertensive encephalopathy, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS). The patient's current care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, monitoring of lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   DRAFT IN PROGRESS NOTE
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE / BLEEDING DISORDER
   Patient is off all anticoagulation. Initial precipitant was likely
   starting heparin in the setting of baseline bleeding risk because of
   hematologic disorders; no evidence of further bleeding; x-ray is
   improving
   -Heme/onc recommends total of 100 g IVIG, feels plasmapheresis
   risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of necessary anticoagulation
   -We are completing IVIG today with final dose of 30 g
   -Appreciate the involvement and recommendations of renal, hematology
   and blood bank services
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Pulmonary hemorrhage and inflammation likely to be major source of her
   respiratory compromise. Resorption of blood and resolution of
   inflammation will hopefully lead to being able to wean; appears to be
   too early to expect this yet. No evidence of further major bleeding.
   - Currently successfully weaning down FiO2
   - Goal is to reduce PEEP after FiO2 down to 0.4
   ?SEIZURE
   Too early to tell whether this was truly a seizure. Bilateral
   coordinated nature of movements; muscle spasm is an alternative
   explanation but hard to explain why this would cause the unremitting
   and unvarying tremor during this period, and why it would have a sudden
   resolution. EEG pending. If this repeated itself, it would be a
   justification for:
   - continuous EEG monitoring at the bedside
   - loading anti-epileptics
   For now observation only.
   FEVER
   Afebrile more recently. We are following up cultures. Fever emerged in
   the setting of acute pulmonary hemorrhage and may be the result of the
   acute inflammatory events that followed; however, underlying infection
   remains a possibility and we are covering with vancomycin and
   Levofloxacin.
   - f/u cultures
   - define vanco/levo course as 10 days until further evidence of source
   emerges; could consider peeling off vanco in advance of this if no
   positive evidence of infection
   ABDOMINAL DISTENSION
   CT scan shows no clear intraabdominal pathology; likely ileus from
   sedation; this is consistent with increasingly bilious (but not bloody)
   return on OG tube.
   - nalaxone 2 mg to increase biliary transit and reduce opiate-induced
   ileus
   - reglan not appropriate in this pt b/c apparently had dystonic
   reactions in the past
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline..
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy vs graft rejection; per
   renal, rejection is less likely given no donor antibodies. Minimal
   urine output continuing.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - because not tolerating PO meds, changed PO prednisone back to
   equivalent dose (60 pred -> to 50 methylpred) of overnight team
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. No plasmapheresis at this
   time
LDH falling, bleeding risk creates more risk than benefit for TPE.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 50 mg IV daily
   - currently planning to restart anticoagulation when benefit outweighs
   risk, likely at low pressure support settings on vent
   TREMORS/LOWER EXTREMITY RIGIDITY. Appreciate neurology consult and
   recs. CT shows edema, no clear focal lesion. Formal MRI read pending.
   No immediate evidence of lesions.
   Depression/Anxiety: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen
   HYPERTENSION. Increasing hypertension; pt has baseline htn;
   - cont amlodipine
   - adding on hydralazine
   - went back to IV with metoprolol to ensure absorption; I am a bit
   concerned about too much rate blocking as if she opens up in terms of
   bleeding she may need this rate; I am inclined to use non-blocking
   agents for hypertension control if we need to increase dosing
   - hold lisinopril given renal failure
   - monitor correlation of HR and BP; discordant relationship would raise
   concern for cerebral process
   - goal BP <150

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, who underwent renal transplant.
- She presented with new acute renal failure, acute pulmonary hemorrhage, and inflammation.
- The patient was on anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which was discontinued due to the bleeding event.
- She experienced a seizure-like event, but further evaluation is needed.
- The patient had a fever, which may be due to the inflammatory events or an underlying infection. Cultures are pending.
- She has abdominal distension, likely caused by ileus from sedation.
- The patient has known acute hemolytic anemia, and her LDH levels are declining.
- She has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy or graft rejection.
- The patient's tremors and lower extremity rigidity are being evaluated by neurology.
- Her hypertension is being managed with amlodipine, hydralazine, and metoprolol.
- The patient's care plan includes IVIG, observation for seizure recurrence, monitoring of cultures, nutritional support, and prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The chief complaints are encephalopathy, pulmonary hemorrhage, and acute renal failure. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cardiovascular symptoms of tachycardia and gastrointestinal symptoms of constipation. The patient appears comfortable without any pain.

24-hour events include the initiation of Nitro ggt for severe hypertension, EEG with encephalopathy findings, weaning of ventilator support, administration of narcan for high residuals, and MRI brain showing hyperintensity patterns. The patient has allergies to certain medications including penicillins and morphine. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin and levofloxacin.

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), current temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), heart rate of 102 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 76 to 172 mmHg, respiratory rate between 22-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. Fluid balance indicates an input of 895 mL, output of 220 mL, and a negative balance of 675 mL over the past 24 hours.

Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen delivery. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37"

 THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA / HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME
   (HUS/TTP)
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   ALVEOLAR/Pulmonary HEMORRHAGE / BLEEDING DISORDER: resolving on CXR
   Patient is off all anticoagulation. Initial precipitant was likely
   starting heparin in the setting of baseline bleeding risk because of
   hematologic disorders; no evidence of further bleeding
   -Heme/onc feels plasmapheresis risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of
   necessary anticoagulation
   -s/p  IVIG
   -Appreciate the involvement and recommendations of renal, hematology
   and blood bank services
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Now with improving oxygenation.  Apparently [**3-6**]
   pulmonary hemorrhage.  Continued altered mental status prevents further
   weaning at this point.  Sputum cx growing SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  CXR w/
   ? LLL consolidation.
   - continue to treat w/ Levofloxacin for ? PNA based on sensitivities
   - continue to wean PEEP to 5
   - will attempt RSBI when able
   ?SEIZURE: Bilateral coordinated nature of movements; muscle spasm is an
   alternative explanation but hard to explain why this would cause the
   unremitting and unvarying tremor during this period, and why it would
   have a sudden resolution. EEG w/ encephalopathy. If this repeated
   itself, it would be a justification for:
   - continuous EEG monitoring at the bedside
   - loading anti-epileptics
   For now observation only.
   FEVER: Tmax 99.8 overnight.  Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  Blood
   cx pending w/o growth to date.
   Had been covered empirically w/ vancomycin and Levofloxacin but given
   sensitivities of SERRATIA MARCESCENS
   - will d/c vanco and continue Levofloxacin for a 7 day course (d1 =
   [**1-5**])
   ABDOMINAL DISTENSION
   CT scan shows no clear intraabdominal pathology; likely ileus from
   sedation; this is consistent with increasingly bilious (but not bloody)
   return on OG tube.
   - given nalaxone 2 mg to increase biliary transit and reduce
   opiate-induced ileus w/o apparent help
   - reglan not appropriate in this pt b/c apparently had dystonic
   reactions in the past
   - will attempt to clamp NGT and re-start tube feeds
   - Lactulose
   - wean fentanyl as able
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200)..
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy vs graft rejection; per
   renal, rejection is less likely given no donor antibodies. Minimal
   urine output continuing.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - because not tolerating PO meds, changed PO prednisone back to
   equivalent dose (60 pred -> to 50 methylpred)
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   - consider rituxan to treat Thrombotic microangiopathy that appears to
   have boxed her transplanted kidney
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. No plasmapheresis at this
   time
LDH falling, bleeding risk creates more risk than benefit for TPE.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 50 mg IV daily
   - currently planning to restart anticoagulation when benefit outweighs
   risk, likely at low pressure support settings on vent
   TREMORS/LOWER EXTREMITY RIGIDITY. Appreciate neurology consult and
   recs. CT shows edema, no clear focal lesion. No immediate evidence of
   lesions on MRI brain.  Appears mildly improved.
   - appreciate neuro input, will continue to follow
   Depression/Anxiety: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen
   HYPERTENSION. Increasing hypertension and has been intermittently on
   nitro ggt.  Per renal, will not start ACEI to prevent renal-toxic
   effects in case transplant kidney comes back.
   - cont amlodipine
   - continue hydral prn
   - went back to IV with metoprolol to ensure absorption; I am a bit
   concerned about too much rate blocking as if she opens up in terms of
   bleeding she may need this rate; I am inclined to use non-blocking
   agents for hypertension control if we need to increase dosing
   - goal BP <150

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who has undergone renal transplant. She presents with new acute renal failure, acute pulmonary hemorrhage, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with serratio marcescens pneumonia.

The patient's medical history includes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), acute renal failure, and a history of bleeding disorders. She was previously on warfarin and has now started on heparin, which may have contributed to the pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient's current conditions include acute respiratory failure, anemia, abdominal distension, and altered mental status. She also has a history of hypertension, depression/anxiety, and tremors/lower extremity rigidity.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and altered oxygen saturation levels. Her laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and other abnormalities consistent with her underlying conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include sepsis secondary to serratio marcescens pneumonia, further bleeding events due to her coagulopathy, acute respiratory distress syndrome"

   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy vs graft rejection; per
   renal, rejection is less likely given no donor antibodies. Minimal
   urine output continuing.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - because not tolerating PO meds, changed PO prednisone back to

   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   ALVEOLAR/Pulmonary HEMORRHAGE / BLEEDING DISORDER: resolving on CXR
   Patient is off all anticoagulation. Initial precipitant was likely
   starting heparin in the setting of baseline bleeding risk because of
   hematologic disorders; no evidence of further bleeding
   -Heme/onc feels plasmapheresis risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of

   ?SEIZURE:No recurrent seizure activity in 24 hrs.  Bilateral
   coordinated nature of movements; muscle spasm is an alternative
   explanation but hard to explain why this would cause the unremitting
   and unvarying tremor during this period, and why it would have a sudden
   resolution. EEG w/ encephalopathy. If this repeated itself, it would be
   a justification for:
   - continuous EEG monitoring at the bedside
   - loading anti-epileptics
   For now observation only.
   FEVER: Tmax 99.5 overnight.  Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  Blood

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who underwent renal transplantation. She presented with acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and encephalopathy. The patient was found to have pulmonary hemorrhage and was started on heparin, which was likely the precipitant of further bleeding. She is currently off all anticoagulation.

The patient's medical conditions include acute on chronic renal failure, thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, hypertension, and anxiety/depression. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, fentanyl, amlodipine, hydralizine, levofloxacin, and methylprednisolone.

The patient's lab results show anemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal no clear intraabdominal pathology and evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient's plan includes continuing levofloxacin for a 7-day course, attempting to wean PEEP to 5, and treating with IVIG. The patient will also be monitored for seizures and given naloxone to increase biliary transit. The NG tube will be clamped and tube feeds restarted. The patient's blood pressure needs to be controlled below 150, and her hemoglobin concentration should be maintained above 25"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   ALVEOLAR/Pulmonary HEMORRHAGE / BLEEDING DISORDER: resolving on CXR --
   RESTARTED HEPARIN
   Patient is off all anticoagulation. Initial precipitant was likely
   starting heparin in the setting of baseline bleeding risk because of
   hematologic disorders; no evidence of further bleeding
   -Heme/onc feels plasmapheresis risk/benefit has too great a risk b/c of
   necessary anticoagulation
   -s/p  IVIG
   -Appreciate the involvement and recommendations of renal, hematology
   and blood bank services
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Now with improving oxygenation.  Apparently [**3-6**]
   pulmonary hemorrhage.  Continued altered mental status prevents further
   weaning at this point.  Sputum cx growing SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  CXR w/
   ? LLL consolidation
   - continue to treat w/ Levofloxacin for ? PNA based on sensitivities
   - continue to wean PEEP to 5
   - will attempt RSBI when able
   ?SEIZURE:No recurrent seizure activity in 24 hrs.  Bilateral
   coordinated nature of movements; muscle spasm is an alternative
   explanation but hard to explain why this would cause the unremitting
   and unvarying tremor during this period, and why it would have a sudden
   resolution. EEG w/ encephalopathy. If this repeated itself, it would be
   a justification for:
   - continuous EEG monitoring at the bedside
   - loading anti-epileptics
   For now observation only.
   FEVER: Tmax 99.5 overnight.  Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  Blood
   cx pending w/o growth to date.
   Had been covered empirically w/ vancomycin and Levofloxacin but given
   sensitivities of SERRATIA MARCESCENS
   - vanco d/c'd on [**1-8**] will continue Levofloxacin for a 7 day course (d1
   = [**1-5**])
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Had a small BM overnight
   CT scan shows no clear intraabdominal pathology; likely from sedation;
   this is consistent with increasingly bilious (but not bloody) return on
   OG tube.
   - given nalaxone 2 mg to increase biliary transit and reduce
   opiate-induced ileus w/o apparent help
   - reglan not appropriate in this pt b/c apparently had dystonic
   reactions in the past
   - will attempt to clamp NGT and re-start tube feeds this am
   - Lactulose prn
   - wean fentanyl as able
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200)..
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy vs graft rejection; per
   renal, rejection is less likely given no donor antibodies. Minimal
   urine output continuing.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - because not tolerating PO meds, changed PO prednisone back to
   equivalent dose (60 pred -> to 50 methylpred)
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   - consider rituxan to treat Thrombotic microangiopathy that appears to
   have boxed her transplanted kidney
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. No plasmapheresis at this
   time
LDH falling, bleeding risk creates more risk than benefit for TPE.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - cont methylprednisolone 50 mg IV daily
   - currently planning to restart heparin ggt if factor Xa and Heparin
   levels are available today given excellent respiratory status w/ PEEP
   of 5/FiO2 of 40%.
   TREMORS/LOWER EXTREMITY RIGIDITY. Appreciate neurology consult and
   recs. CT shows edema, no clear focal lesion. No immediate evidence of
   lesions on MRI brain.  Appears mildly improved.
   - appreciate neuro input, will continue to follow
   Depression/Anxiety: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen
   HYPERTENSION. Increasing hypertension in the setting of weaning
   Fentanyl.  Per renal, will not start ACEI to prevent renal-toxic
   effects in case transplant kidney comes back. Added amlodipine
   yesterday w/ prn hydralizine. Has a history of malignant HTN and
   worsening HTN is not suprising in the setting of high-dose steroids.
   - increase amlodipine from 5 mg to 10 mg daily
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV Q 6hrs, will consider an esmolol ggt if needed
   - goal BP <150

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who underwent renal transplant. She presents with new acute renal failure and acute pulmonary hemorrhage after starting heparin. The patient has multiple medical complications including alveolar/pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, seizure, fever, abdominal ileus, anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, tremors/lower extremity rigidity, depression/anxiety, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation, sedation, and multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alveolar/pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient has a history of pulmonary hemorrhage and is at risk for recurrent bleeding due to her underlying hematologic disorders.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she continues to require mechanical ventilation. She also has a sputum culture growing Serratia marcescens, which may require adjustment in antibiotic therapy.
3. Seizure: The patient had a seizure episode, but no recurrent seizure activity was observed in the past 24 hours. Further investigation and monitoring are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Fever: The patient's temperature is elevated, and she has a positive sputum culture for Serratia marcescens."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) with resultant ESRD s/p renal
   transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute pulmonary
   hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
ing warfarin.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: due to acute lung injury, aspiration, pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Sputum culture with Serratia [**Last Name (un) **] to Levofloxacin.
   Continues to have acute lung injury PaO2/FiO2 about 200.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: no more blood from suctioning, CXR resolved.
   Precipitant felt to be heparin in setting of PAI deficiency. Patient
   has been treated with IVIG. Currently monitoring pulmonary function
   given restarted heparin due to patient
s Thrombotic microangiopathy.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: in setting of aspirating blood and ? serratia PNA
   - convert Levofloxacin to PO to complete 7 day course, last day [**1-12**]
   - increased  PEEP to 8 given atelectasis with PEEP at 5
   * VENT
   - if agitated will change to PS or increase tidal volumes to see if
   patient with component of air hunger on ARDS vent settings.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy vs graft rejection; per
   renal, rejection is less likely given no donor antibodies. Minimal
   urine output continuing.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - convert methyl pred to prednisone as patient now tolerating tube
   feeds (60 pred = 50 methylpred)
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Plasmapheresis was
   considered but not initiated as risks were felt to outweight benefits.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - convert methyl pred to prednisone as patient now tolerating tube
   feeds (60 pred = 50 methylpred)
   - restarted heparin, goal PTT 60 will also send factor Xa and heparin
   levels.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient with whole body movements [**1-7**]. Has
   lower extremity hyperreflexia and increased tone. CT head with ? mild
   edema,  but MRI/MRA grossly negative. EEG with moderate encephalopathy
   and no sign of ongoing seizure activity.
   - appreciate neurology recs. Given patient vented, on heparin drip will
   not pursue MRI/MRA neck at this time as if found hematoma/clot would
   not intervene and patient exam has stabilized/improved.
   - cont to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able as this may be contributing to increased tone
   FEVER: Tmax 100.6 overnight.  Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  Blood
   cx pending w/o growth to date.
   Had been covered empirically w/ vancomycin and Levofloxacin but given
   sensitivities of serratia vanco d/c'd on [**1-8**] will continue
   Levofloxacin for a 7 day course (d1 = [**1-5**]).
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when active
   Thrombotic microangiopathy.  h/o hypertensive crisis and seizure.
   - cont amlodipine
   - convert metoprolol to PO
   - start capropril and uptitrate as needed (okay per renal)
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <150
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Improved on nalaxone. Tolerating tube feeds. Not on
   raglan due to dystonic rxn in past.
   CT scan shows no clear intraabdominal pathology; likely from sedation;
   this is consistent with increasingly bilious (but not bloody) return on
   OG tube.
   - Lactulose prn
   - Wean fentanyl as able
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200)..
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   Depression/Anxiety: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.
   - consider restarting in next 1-2 days given tolerating PO

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient presented with acute pulmonary hemorrhage, which is a severe condition that requires immediate medical attention. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation levels closely.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which could be due to various factors such as graft damage from thrombotic microangiopathy or rejection. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function is necessary.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), which increases the risk of blood clotting disorders. Heparin therapy is being used to prevent further thrombotic events, but careful monitoring of coagulation parameters is required.

4. Acute lung injury (ALI): The patient's ALI is likely due to aspiration and pulmonary hemorrhage. Appropriate ventilatory support and measures to prevent further lung injury should be implemented.

5. Fever: The patient has a fever, and the sputum culture showed growth of Serratia marcescens. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on the sensitivities of the organism.

6. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits agitation, hyperreflexia, and increased tone. These symptoms may be attributed to the sedation regimen or potential neurological complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to acute lung injury in the setting of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and aspiration injury. The patient remains intubated but is slowly tolerating decreasing ventilator settings. The patient has a history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and is on heparin therapy. The patient has multiple medical conditions including presumed DAH, aspiration, renal failure, thrombotic microangiopathy, hypertension, depressed mental status, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is receiving various medications, including steroids, immunoglobulins, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
   - Barotrauma or bronchial rupture due to high pressures during ventilation
   - Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) due to excessive tidal volumes or repetitive opening and closing of alveoli
   - Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and hypercoagulable state

2. Renal Complications:
   - Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis
   - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) if AKI progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)

3. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Hypertensive emergencies or"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory failure due to presumed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and aspiration, renal failure requiring dialysis, thrombotic microangiopathy treated with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), hypertension, depressed mental status with ongoing sedation weaning, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Serratia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to presumed DAH and aspiration. They are currently on decreasing ventilator settings with low tidal volume ventilation and increasing PEEP to address atelectasis. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is now dependent on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week via temporary line. They are also receiving immunosuppressive therapy with Solumedrol and Cellcept. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte balance is crucial to guide further management.

3. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient is being treated with steroid taper and IVIg for thrombotic microangiopathy. Heparin was restarted due to concern for thrombosis risk. Monitoring for signs of thrombosis and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed is important.

4. Hypertension: The patient is attempting to transition to oral antihypertensive"

   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) as well as PAI deficiency,
   leading to pathologic bleeding and clotting, with resultant ESRD s/p
   renal transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute
   pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
   warfarin.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: due to acute lung injury, aspiration, pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Sputum culture with Serratia [**Last Name (un) **] to Levofloxacin.
   Continues to have acute lung injury PaO2/FiO2 about 200.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: no more blood from suctioning, CXR resolved.
   Precipitant felt to be heparin in setting of PAI deficiency. Patient
   has been treated with IVIG. Currently monitoring pulmonary function
   given restarted heparin due to patient
s Thrombotic microangiopathy.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: in setting of aspirating blood and ? serratia PNA
   - convert Levofloxacin to PO to complete 7 day course, last day [**1-12**]
   - increased  PEEP to 8 given atelectasis with PEEP at 5
   * VENT
   - if agitated will change to PS or increase tidal volumes to see if
   patient with component of air hunger on ARDS vent settings.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy vs graft rejection; per
   renal, rejection is less likely given no donor antibodies. Minimal
   urine output continuing.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - convert methyl pred to prednisone as patient now tolerating tube
   feeds (60 pred = 50 methylpred)
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - cont mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Plasmapheresis was
   considered but not initiated as risks were felt to outweight benefits.
   - hematology input appreciated
   - convert methyl pred to prednisone as patient now tolerating tube
   feeds (60 pred = 50 methylpred)
   - restarted heparin, goal PTT 60 will also send factor Xa and heparin
   levels.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient with whole body movements [**1-7**]. Has
   lower extremity hyperreflexia and increased tone. CT head with ? mild
   edema,  but MRI/MRA grossly negative. EEG with moderate encephalopathy
   and no sign of ongoing seizure activity.
   - appreciate neurology recs. Given patient vented, on heparin drip will
   not pursue MRI/MRA neck at this time as if found hematoma/clot would
   not intervene and patient exam has stabilized/improved.
   - cont to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able as this may be contributing to increased tone
   FEVER: Tmax 100.6 overnight.  Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  Blood
   cx pending w/o growth to date.
   Had been covered empirically w/ vancomycin and Levofloxacin but given
   sensitivities of serratia vanco d/c'd on [**1-8**] will continue
   Levofloxacin for a 7 day course (d1 = [**1-5**]).
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when active
   Thrombotic microangiopathy.  h/o hypertensive crisis and seizure.
   - cont amlodipine
   - convert metoprolol to PO
   - start capropril and uptitrate as needed (okay per renal)
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <150
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Improved on nalaxone. Tolerating tube feeds. Not on
   raglan due to dystonic rxn in past.
   CT scan shows no clear intraabdominal pathology; likely from sedation;
   this is consistent with increasingly bilious (but not bloody) return on
   OG tube.
   - Lactulose prn
   - Wean fentanyl as able
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200)..
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   Depression/Anxiety: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.
   - consider restarting in next 1-2 days given tolerating PO

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including lupus antiphospholipid syndrome, prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), and PAI deficiency. She has undergone renal transplantation and is currently presenting with acute renal failure, acute pulmonary hemorrhage, and thrombotic microangiopathy. 

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of renal transplantation and is now experiencing acute renal failure. This could be due to graft damage caused by thrombotic microangiopathy or rejection. Further evaluation and treatment are required.

2. Acute pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient has developed pulmonary hemorrhage, which may be related to the initiation of heparin therapy in the setting of PAI deficiency. She has been treated with IVIG and is being monitored closely.

3. Thrombotic microangiopathy: The patient has a history of TMA, which is a condition characterized by small blood clots forming in the blood vessels. This can lead to organ damage and dysfunction. She has received plasmapheresis but it was not initiated due to risks outweighing benefits.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and acute lung injury. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of about 200.

5. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive at baseline, especially during episodes of thrombotic microangiopathy. She is being managed with antihypertensive medications.

6. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, with agitation and hyperreflexia. An EEG showed moderate encephalopathy without ongoing seizure activity. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

7. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is suspected to be due to an infection. Sputum culture showed Serratia marcescens, and she is being treated with Levofloxacin.

8. Anemia: The patient has acute hemolytic anemia, which is likely secondary to the ongoing thrombotic microangiopathy. Transfusion support is being provided.

9. Depression/anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, but psychotropic medications are being held at the moment.

Overall, the patient requires intensive care management for her multiple organ dysfunction and complications. Close monitoring and individualized treatment plans are necessary to address each of her medical conditions."

","The patient's chief complaint is pulmonary hemorrhage and renal failure in the setting of a complex hematologic disorder. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

Based on the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress:

- The patient was weaned off propofol but became restless and tachycardic. Propofol was restarted due to hematocrit drop and increased pulmonary bloody secretions.
- Heparin was started but stopped after a significant drop in hematocrit and increased pulmonary bloody secretions.
- The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
- Medications were converted to a po form since the gut is working.
- Captopril was started and uptitrated for blood pressure control. Nitro drip was stopped.
- Sodium levels decreased to 121 in the setting of volume increasing, and hemodialysis (HD) was scheduled for early am.
- Allergies include Keflex, penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, Compazine, and Reglan.
- The patient has been agitated, agitated with light sedation, and now on higher level of sedation.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/82 to 188/101 mmHg,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) who presented with new acute renal failure and acute pulmonary hemorrhage after starting heparin. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, hypertension, alteration in nutrition, anemia, ineffective coping, renal failure, respiratory failure, and thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia.

Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient experienced acute pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after discontinuing warfarin. This complication was precipitated by heparin in the presence of PAI deficiency. The patient has been treated with IVIG.

2. Acute lung injury: The patient has acute lung injury with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of about 200. This is likely due to aspirating blood and possible Serratia infection, as indicated by a positive sputum culture.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. This may be caused by graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy or graft rejection. Minimal urine output continues, and the patient requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD).

4. Thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia: The patient has a history of TMA and is currently experiencing thrombotic microangiopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) as well as PAI deficiency,
   leading to pathologic bleeding and clotting, with resultant ESRD s/p
   renal transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute
   pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
   warfarin.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: due to acute lung injury, aspiration, pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Sputum culture with Serratia [**Last Name (un) **] to Levofloxacin. P/F
   increasing to 380 today. See below regarding pulmonary hemorrhage;
   stopped heparin and received FFP, and although had some bloody
   secretions suctioned back, chest x-ray and vent settings suggest no
   significant respiratory compromise from what was likely a very early
   stage of bleeding.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: A drop in Hct overnight and some blood coming
   back from suction prompted cessation of heparin overnight. This is
   consistent with her last presentation of pulmonary hemorrhage which was
   also in the setting of heparin. In the longer run the patient still
   clearly needs anticoagulation.
   - discuss anticoagulation strategies with heme; ?lower heparin target,
   etc.
   - given the last presentation of pulmonary hemorrhage, it is likely
   that the patient, if extubated and with intact mental status, would be
   able to recognize earlier signs of pulmonary hemorrhage and that
   heparin could be stopped based on increasing dyspnea and O2
   requirements. Therefore at this point would not keep intubated for the
   sake of restarting anticoagulation.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: in setting of aspirating blood and ? serratia PNA.
   Levofloxacin completing 7 day course, last day= [**1-12**]
   - P/F improving as above
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Currently starting pressure support trial on [**6-7**]. Doing well thus far.
   Goal will be SBT and move towards extubation. Likely will continue to
   need ICU stay for restarting heparin, close monitoring.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Minimal urine output continuing. At this point her transplanted kidney
   is likely not to recover function, but still continuing immune
   suppression against rejection for now. Inflammation associated with
   acute rejection would likely be more dangerous than effects of
   continuing CellCept.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - continue prednisone for renal and heme purposes
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition.
   Plasmapheresis was considered but not initiated as risks were felt to
   outweight benefits. Will revisit this now that we are 1 week s/p IVIG.
   - will discuss with hematology, very much appreciate their ongoing
   recommendations
   - stopped heparin as above; will need to restart at some point soon,
   and will discuss how to do this safely with hematology and develop
   joint plan for treatment targets and monitoring
   - convert methyl pred to prednisone as patient now tolerating tube
   feeds (60 pred = 50 methylpred)
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient continuing to have some lower body
   movements, and yesterday appeared to be tracking people in the room.
   Still with increased tone; this may be secondary to fentanyl sedation
   and we are taking this off now. CT head with ? mild edema,  but MRI/MRA
   negative. EEG with moderate encephalopathy and no sign of ongoing
   seizure activity.
   - appreciate neurology recs. Given patient vented, on heparin drip will
   not pursue MRI/MRA neck at this time as if found hematoma/clot would
   not intervene and patient exam has stabilized/improved.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able
   FEVER: Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  Blood cx pending w/o growth
   to date. Had been covered empirically w/ vancomycin and Levofloxacin
   but given sensitivities of serratia vanco d/c'd on [**1-8**] will continue
   Levofloxacin for a 7 day course (d1 = [**1-5**]). Last day = today.
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve; afebrile recently
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension. One issue is that
   sedation continues to be kept on because she gets hypertensive without

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid, prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and PAI deficiency. She presented with acute renal failure and acute pulmonary hemorrhage after starting heparin therapy. The patient has also experienced altered mental status, fever, hypertension, ileus, and anemia.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to acute lung injury, aspiration, and pulmonary hemorrhage. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her oxygenation has improved, but she still requires close monitoring.

2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient had a drop in hematocrit overnight and bloody secretions, prompting the cessation of heparin therapy. This is consistent with her previous presentation of pulmonary hemorrhage while on heparin. Anticoagulation strategies need to be discussed with hematology, considering restarting heparin at some point soon.

3. Acute Lung Injury: The patient has developed acute lung injury possibly due to aspiration of blood and infection with Serratia marcescens. Levofloxacin was given for a 7-day course, and the patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is improving.

4. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation and doing well. The goal is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) as well as PAI deficiency,
   leading to pathologic bleeding and clotting, with resultant ESRD s/p
   renal transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute
   pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
   warfarin.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: due to acute lung injury, aspiration, pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Sputum culture with Serratia [**Last Name (un) **] to Levofloxacin. P/F
   increasing to 380 today. See below regarding pulmonary hemorrhage;
   stopped heparin and received FFP, and although had some bloody
   secretions suctioned back, chest x-ray and vent settings suggest no
   significant respiratory compromise from what was likely a very early
   stage of bleeding.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: A drop in Hct overnight and some blood coming
   back from suction prompted cessation of heparin overnight. This is
   consistent with her last presentation of pulmonary hemorrhage which was
   also in the setting of heparin. In the longer run the patient still
   clearly needs anticoagulation.
   - discuss anticoagulation strategies with heme; ?lower heparin target,
   etc.
   - given the last presentation of pulmonary hemorrhage, it is likely
   that the patient, if extubated and with intact mental status, would be
   able to recognize earlier signs of pulmonary hemorrhage and that
   heparin could be stopped based on increasing dyspnea and O2
   requirements. Therefore at this point would not keep intubated for the
   sake of restarting anticoagulation.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: in setting of aspirating blood and ? serratia PNA.
   Levofloxacin completing 7 day course, last day= [**1-12**]
   - P/F improving as above
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Currently starting pressure support trial on [**6-7**]. Doing well thus far.
   Goal will be SBT and move towards extubation. Likely will continue to
   need ICU stay for restarting heparin, close monitoring.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Minimal urine output continuing. At this point her transplanted kidney
   is likely not to recover function, but still continuing immune
   suppression against rejection for now. Inflammation associated with
   acute rejection would likely be more dangerous than effects of
   continuing CellCept.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - continue prednisone for renal and heme purposes
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition.
   Plasmapheresis was considered but not initiated as risks were felt to
   outweight benefits. Will revisit this now that we are 1 week s/p IVIG.
   - will discuss with hematology, very much appreciate their ongoing
   recommendations
   - stopped heparin as above; will need to restart at some point soon,
   and will discuss how to do this safely with hematology and develop
   joint plan for treatment targets and monitoring
   - convert methyl pred to prednisone as patient now tolerating tube
   feeds (60 pred = 50 methylpred)
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient continuing to have some lower body
   movements, and yesterday appeared to be tracking people in the room.
   Still with increased tone; this may be secondary to fentanyl sedation
   and we are taking this off now. CT head with ? mild edema,  but MRI/MRA
   negative. EEG with moderate encephalopathy and no sign of ongoing
   seizure activity.
   - appreciate neurology recs. Given patient vented, on heparin drip will
   not pursue MRI/MRA neck at this time as if found hematoma/clot would
   not intervene and patient exam has stabilized/improved.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able
   FEVER: Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  Blood cx pending w/o growth
   to date. Had been covered empirically w/ vancomycin and Levofloxacin
   but given sensitivities of serratia vanco d/c'd on [**1-8**] will continue
   Levofloxacin for a 7 day course (d1 = [**1-5**]). Last day = today.
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve; afebrile recently
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension. One issue is that
   sedation continues to be kept on because she gets hypertensive without
   sedation; we will now try to wean sedation and aggressively treat
   hypertension in this context, with getting her off the vent being the
   primary goal.
   - cont amlodipine
   - convert metoprolol to PO
   - start capropril and uptitrate as needed (okay per renal)
   - nitro drip as needed
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <160
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Improved on naloxone though again this AM had some
   residuals. Not on reglan due to dystonic rxn in past.
   - Lactulose prn
   - Wean fentanyl as able
   - naloxone + bowel regimen as long as on fentanyl; laxatives/stool
   softeners alone if not
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools

   - consider restarting in next 1-2 days given tolerating PO

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted with renal failure and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient's course has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and there is uncertainty regarding whether it is due to aspiration, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). The patient's oxygenation has improved, and they are being weaned off ventilator settings. The patient is receiving hemodialysis (HD) for renal failure and will continue with Cellcept and prednisone. There are concerns about potential complications such as pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, hypertension, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient's bloody secretions and Hct drop suggest a possible pulmonary hemorrhage. Heparin has been stopped, and the patient will continue to be monitored for any signs of bleeding or clotting.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, which has been classified as ARDS. The patient's mental status remains a barrier to extubation, but sedation will be weaned today.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and the plan is to control their blood pressure with an IV drip. Once extubated, the patient will transition to intermittent dosing.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is on hemodialysis for renal failure. Cellcept and pred"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with renal failure and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). They have been admitted to the ICU and are experiencing complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI). The patient's condition has improved with improved oxygenation and weaning of ventilator settings.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and is on pressure support. Oxygenation remains improved with no new infiltrates on chest X-ray today. However, mental status remains the main barrier to extubation. The patient's ABG will be followed up on these settings.
3. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled blood pressure, which needs to be addressed with IV medication. Once extubated, the patient will transition to intermittent dosing.

   Assessment and Plan
   As per resident note. Briefly,
   1) Pulm. hemorage - Heparin stopped in setting of bloody secretions,
   hct drop. Will continue to hold anticoagulation for now. Oxygenation
   remains improved and no new infiltrate on CXR  today. Will f/u heme
   recs but seems at greater risk for bleed than clot at the present time.
   2) Respiratory Failure - ARDS [**3-6**] aspiration vs. DAH vs. TRALI . P/F >
   300. On pressure support [**6-7**]. Will f/u ABG on these settings. Mental
   status remains the greatest barrier to extubation. When off sedation
   she closed eyes to command. Sedation reinitiated because of possible
   explanation for hypertension, though she did not seem agitated when off
   sedation.
   3) Hypertension - Plan to control BP with IV drip. Will transition to
   intermittent dosing once extubated.
   4) Renal Failure - on HD. Cellcept + prednisone to continue. Will
   change over to PO.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is renal failure and they have a history of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient's course has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), making it difficult to differentiate between diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI). The patient is currently on hemodialysis and has received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration and bloody secretions.

The patient has multiple allergies, including a rash reaction to penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, Compazine, and Reglan. The last dose of antibiotics was given on 01/10/2018 at 01:30 PM.

The patient is currently on fentanyl infusion and lansoprazole. The flow sheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature range of 35.9-37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 68-77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/73 mmHg to 188/101 mmHg, respiratory rate between 23-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 320 mL, spontaneous tidal volume of 483 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a complex heme disorder with renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone several interventions. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and is currently on various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and nutritional support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled blood pressure and oxygen saturation. However, they have altered mental status and require mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Laboratory results show acute renal failure, anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated levels of lactate and LDH. The patient is also suspected to have thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS/TTP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ventilator settings and oxygenation is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. Monitoring urine output, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid balance is crucial to manage this condition effectively.
3. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS/TTP): The patient's laboratory results indicate possible HUS/TTP. This condition requires prompt treatment to prevent further organ damage.
4. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient's history of pulmonary hemorrhage puts them at"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) as well as PAI deficiency,
   leading to pathologic bleeding and clotting, with resultant ESRD s/p
   renal transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute
   pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
   warfarin.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: due to acute lung injury, aspiration, pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Doing well on PS this AM. Bleeding on line sites prompted
   stop of heparin again.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No evidence of new hemorrhage. Stopped with
   peripheral bleeding. Will discuss new heparin targets with heme/onc.
   Last tries have been at rate of 550 units/hr so should shoot for below
   this, assuming labs will show quite subtherapeutic range, target this
   subtherapeutic range.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: in setting of aspirating blood and ? serratia PNA.
   Levofloxacin completed
   - P/F improving as above
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Doing well on pressure support. Measure NIF. Evaluate mental status as
   component of possible extubation. Doing well enough in terms of
   respiratory parameters to contemplate this if she can participate. Try
   to avoid sedation to see if we can get her more alert.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Minimal urine output continuing. At this point her transplanted kidney
   is likely not to recover function, but still continuing immune
   suppression against rejection for now. Inflammation associated with
   acute rejection would likely be more dangerous than effects of
   continuing CellCept.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - continue prednisone for renal and heme purposes
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition.
   Plasmapheresis was considered but not initiated as risks were felt to
   outweight benefits. Will revisit this now that we are 1 week s/p IVIG.
   -          discuss TPE w heme
   -          continue steroid tx
   -          follow LDH and smears
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient continuing to have improvement, though
   still not following commands. Sedation vs hypoxic brain injury earlier
   in course vs?.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able
   - holding psych meds for now
   STIFF LEGS: Increased motor tone has decreased in severity and she is
   moving her legs; however neuro exam remains abnormal.
   - C-spine MRI to follow up earlier evaluation
   FEVER: Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  No positive blood cultures.
   Completed treatment with levo.
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve; afebrile recently
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension. One issue is that
   sedation continues to be kept on because she gets hypertensive without
   sedation; we will now try to wean sedation and aggressively treat
   hypertension in this context, with getting her off the vent being the
   primary goal.
   - cont amlodipine
   - metoprolol PO
   - start capropril and uptitrate as needed (okay per renal)
   - nitro drip as needed
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <160
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Naloxone only with fentanyl sedation. No reglan b/c of
   past dystonic reaction.
   - Lactulose prn
   - Wean fentanyl as able
   - naloxone + bowel regimen as long as on fentanyl; laxatives/stool
   softeners alone if not
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.
   - consider restarting tomorrow

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a complex medical history including lupus antiphospholipid, prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), PAI deficiency, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant. She is currently presenting with acute renal failure and acute pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute lung injury, aspiration, and pulmonary hemorrhage, which are causing respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is doing well.

2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient had bleeding at the line sites, leading to discontinuation of heparin therapy. There is no evidence of new pulmonary hemorrhage, but she may require targeted heparin therapy with monitoring.

3. Acute Lung Injury: The patient has acute lung injury due to aspiration of blood and possible infection with Serratia PNA. Levofloxacin was completed, and her P/F ratio is improving.

4. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient is doing well on pressure support and may be a candidate for extubation. Mental status evaluation will be important in this decision-making process.

5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy, with minimal urine output. Immune suppression against rejection is being continued, and inflammation"

   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Minimal urine output continuing. At this point her transplanted kidney
   is likely not to recover function, but still continuing immune
   suppression against rejection for now. Inflammation associated with
   acute rejection would likely be more dangerous than effects of
   continuing CellCept.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - continue prednisone for renal and heme purposes
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD; will go on to Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule now
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition.
   Plasmapheresis was considered but not initiated as risks were felt to
   outweight benefits. Will revisit this now that we are 1 week s/p IVIG.
   - will discuss with hematology, very much appreciate their ongoing
   recommendations
   - stopped heparin as above; will need to restart at some point soon,
   and will discuss how to do this safely with hematology and develop
   joint plan for treatment targets and monitoring
   - convert methyl pred to prednisone as patient now tolerating tube
   feeds (60 pred = 50 methylpred)
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient continuing to have some lower body
   movements, and yesterday appeared to be tracking people in the room.
   Still with increased tone; this may be secondary to fentanyl sedation
   and we are taking this off now. CT head with ? mild edema,  but MRI/MRA
   negative. EEG with moderate encephalopathy and no sign of ongoing
   seizure activity.
   - appreciate neurology recs. Given patient vented, on heparin drip will
   not pursue MRI/MRA neck at this time as if found hematoma/clot would
   not intervene and patient exam has stabilized/improved.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able
   FEVER: Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  Blood cx pending w/o growth
   to date. Had been covered empirically w/ vancomycin and Levofloxacin
   but given sensitivities of serratia vanco d/c'd on [**1-8**] will continue
   Levofloxacin for a 7 day course (d1 = [**1-5**]). Last day = today.
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve; afebrile recently
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension. One issue is that
   sedation continues to be kept on because she gets hypertensive without
   sedation; we will now try to wean sedation and aggressively treat
   hypertension in this context, with getting her off the vent being the
   primary goal.
   - cont amlodipine
   - convert metoprolol to PO
   - start capropril and uptitrate as needed (okay per renal)
   - nitro drip as needed
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <160
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Improved on naloxone though again this AM had some
   residuals. Not on reglan due to dystonic rxn in past.
   - Lactulose prn
   - Wean fentanyl as able
   - naloxone + bowel regimen as long as on fentanyl; laxatives/stool
   softeners alone if not
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.
   - consider restarting in next 1-2 days given tolerating PO

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid, prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), and PAI deficiency.
- She has undergone renal transplant and is presenting with new acute renal failure, acute pulmonary hemorrhage, and respiratory failure due to acute lung injury, aspiration, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
- The patient has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, PAI inhibition, and is on immune suppression to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney.
- She has altered mental status, fever, hypertension, ileus, anemia, and depression/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances in the body.
2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient has experienced acute pulmonary hemorrhage, which can cause respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia: The patient's thrombotic disorder increases the risk of blood clots forming in the blood vessels, leading to potential blockages and complications.
4. Rejection of transplanted kidney: Immune suppression therapy is being administered to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney. However, there is still a risk of rejection occurring.
5. Infection: The patient has a fever"

   line site. While heparin is off will try to get a tunelled dialysis
   line, then restart at low dose. Awaiting heme recs as to utility of
   pheresis in settin gof ongoin hemolysis. Continues on prednisone.
   2) Renal Failure - on tiw HD now. Htn likely related to progressive
   volume overload, can consider daily HD if becomes a [**Last Name 6966**] problem.
   Prednisone + cellcept for (now presumably failed) graft.
   3) Respiratory Failure - [**3-6**] ARDS. Oxygenation improved and does wake
   up off propofol. SBT today on 0/0 for at least 20-30 minutes (too
   ensure she tolerates increased preload) then look to extubate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent renal transplantation. The patient is now experiencing new renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the setting of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her current condition. These include:

1. Lupus anticoagulant, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) - Heparin off last night bleeding from line site. The patient may develop further bleeding complications due to the combination of heparin therapy and TMA.

2. Renal Failure - The patient is currently on twice-weekly hemodialysis (HD), but may require daily HD if hypertension and volume overload persist. There is also a possibility of graft rejection, which could further compromise renal function.

3. Respiratory Failure - The patient has ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation. Extubation may be considered if the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for an extended period. However, the risk of post-extubation complications, such as respiratory failure, should be monitored closely.

4. Coagulopathy - The patient has antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which increases the risk of both bleeding and thrombotic events. Monitoring of coagulation parameters"

   (HUS/TTP)
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) as well as PAI deficiency,
   leading to pathologic bleeding and clotting, with resultant ESRD s/p
   renal transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute
   pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
   warfarin.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: due to acute lung injury, aspiration, pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Doing well on PS this AM. Bleeding on line sites prompted
   stop of heparin again.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No evidence of new hemorrhage. Stopped with
   peripheral bleeding. Will discuss new heparin targets with heme/onc.
   Last tries have been at rate of 550 units/hr so should shoot for below
   this, assuming labs will show quite subtherapeutic range, target this
   subtherapeutic range.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: in setting of aspirating blood and ? serratia PNA.
   Levofloxacin completed
   - P/F improving as above
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Doing well on pressure support. Measure NIF. Evaluate mental status as
   component of possible extubation. Doing well enough in terms of
   respiratory parameters to contemplate this if she can participate. Try
   to avoid sedation to see if we can get her more alert.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Minimal urine output continuing. At this point her transplanted kidney
   is likely not to recover function, but still continuing immune
   suppression against rejection for now. Inflammation associated with
   acute rejection would likely be more dangerous than effects of
   continuing CellCept.
   - appreciate renal and transplant surgery input
   - continue prednisone for renal and heme purposes
   - holding sirolimus per renal
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition.
   Plasmapheresis was considered but not initiated as risks were felt to
   outweight benefits. Will revisit this now that we are 1 week s/p IVIG.
   -          discuss TPE w heme
   -          continue steroid tx
   -          follow LDH and smears
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient continuing to have improvement, though
   still not following commands. Sedation vs hypoxic brain injury earlier
   in course vs?.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able
   - holding psych meds for now
   STIFF LEGS: Increased motor tone has decreased in severity and she is
   moving her legs; however neuro exam remains abnormal.
   - C-spine MRI to follow up earlier evaluation
   FEVER: Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  No positive blood cultures.
   Completed treatment with levo.
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve; afebrile recently
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension. One issue is that
   sedation continues to be kept on because she gets hypertensive without
   sedation; we will now try to wean sedation and aggressively treat
   hypertension in this context, with getting her off the vent being the
   primary goal.
   - cont amlodipine
   - metoprolol PO
   - start capropril and uptitrate as needed (okay per renal)
   - nitro drip as needed
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <160
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Naloxone only with fentanyl sedation. No reglan b/c of
   past dystonic reaction.
   - Lactulose prn
   - Wean fentanyl as able
   - naloxone + bowel regimen as long as on fentanyl; laxatives/stool
   softeners alone if not
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.
   - consider restarting tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), presenting with new acute renal failure. She has undergone a renal transplant and is now experiencing acute pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient has a complex medical history, including pathologic bleeding and clotting, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, hypertension, acute lung injury, mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure, thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, and stiff legs. She has also had fever, hypertension crisis, ileus, anemia, depression/anxiety, and is receiving multiple medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS/TTP): Given the patient's history of TMA and lupus antiphospholipid, there is a risk of developing TTP/HUS, which can lead to renal failure, bleeding, and clotting complications.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute lung injury and pulmonary hemorrhage increase the risk of developing ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), antiphospholipid antibodies, primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAI), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after renal transplant. She is currently in the ICU with new-onset renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and bleeding diathesis due to therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since [**2118-1-11**] and is being prepared for extubation today. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 169/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. She is receiving various medications including fentanyl, hydralazine, midazolam, lansoprazole, and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has significant bleeding from the arterial line site, and there is a risk of further bleeding due to her bleeding diathesis and therapeutic anticoagulation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to the need for dialysis. Acute kidney injury (AKI) may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with a complex bleeding/clotting disorder, renal failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient underwent pheresis catheter removal and dialysis catheter placement. Heparin was started with a lower target after consultation with Heme-Onc, but the patient continued to bleed from the arterial line site. Heparin was subsequently held off, and two more units were ordered to pull the arterial line if extubation is successful.

The patient has allergies to Keflex (rash), penicillins (rash), dicloxacillin (rash), morphine (unknown), Compazine (dystonia), and Reglan (parkinsonism). The last dose of antibiotics was Levofloxacin on 01/11/2118 at 03:16 PM.

Infusions include Fentanyl started on 01/12/2118 at 02:00 PM, Hydralazine started on 01/13/2118 at 05:00 AM, Midazolam (Versed) started on 01/13/2118 at 05:30 AM, and Lansoprazole (Prevacid) started on 01/13/2118 at 08:00 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) as well as PAI deficiency,
   leading to pathologic bleeding and clotting, with resultant ESRD s/p
   renal transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute
   pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
   warfarin.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: due to acute lung injury, aspiration, pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Doing well on PS this AM. Bleeding on line sites prompted
   stop of heparin again.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin stopped
   as below.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: in setting of aspirating blood and ? serratia PNA.
   Levofloxacin completed
   - P/F improving as above
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Doing well on pressure support and SBT. Plan this AM to extubate. Note
   evolving events as the data for this note were imported into it;
   respiratory data above reflects end of trial of extubation. Reflecting
   AM assessment, decision to extubate based on excellent data, doing very
   well with good gasses on SBT as well as on minimal PS settings.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Essentially anuric. At this point her transplanted kidney is likely not
   to recover function, but still continuing immune suppression against
   rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue prednisone for renal and heme purposes
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. Heparin
   started and stopped after A-line bleeding. A-line bleeding continued
   through the night.
   -       plan this AM to pull A-line and hold pressure which we did; had
   held overnight in anticipation of needing multiple blood gasses
   pre-extubation.
   -          continue steroid tx
   -          follow LDH and smears
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient continuing to have improvement, though
   still not following commands. Sedation vs hypoxic brain injury earlier
   in course vs ?.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able
   - holding psych meds for now
   STIFF LEGS: Increased motor tone has decreased in severity and she is
   moving her legs; however neuro exam remains abnormal.
   - C-spine MRI to follow up earlier evaluation
will schedule for today
   FEVER: Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  No positive blood cultures.
   Completed treatment with levo.
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve; afebrile recently
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.
   - cont amlodipine
   - metoprolol PO
   - start capropril and uptitrate as needed (okay per renal)
   - nitro drip as needed
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <160
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Naloxone only with fentanyl sedation. No reglan b/c of
   past dystonic reaction.
   - Lactulose prn
   - Wean fentanyl as able
   - naloxone + bowel regimen as long as on fentanyl; laxatives/stool
   softeners alone if not
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give [**Year (4 digits) **].
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a complex medical history including lupus antiphospholipid syndrome, prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), PAI deficiency, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, and acute renal failure. She presented with new acute renal failure and acute pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after discontinuing warfarin.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Respiratory Failure: Due to acute lung injury, aspiration, and pulmonary hemorrhage. She is currently doing well on pressure support and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). However, she required reintubation due to evolving events.
2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: No evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin was stopped due to bleeding at the arterial line sites.
3. Acute Lung Injury: In the setting of aspirating blood and possible Serratia pneumonia. Levofloxacin was completed, and her P/F (PaO2/FiO2) ratio is improving.
4. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient is doing well on pressure support and SBT, but required reintubation.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies. She is essentially anuric. The transplanted kidney is unlikely to recover function, but immune suppression against rejection will continue"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure. She failed extubation due to weakness, likely caused by steroid myopathy. There are signs of aspiration pneumonia. The patient has pulmonary hemorrhage, acute lung injury, mechanical ventilation, altered mental status, and hyperreflexia. She also has an ileus, acute-on-chronic renal failure with graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, hypertension, and anemia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to further deterioration in lung function, potential infection, or the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency): The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. This can result in hemorrhagic complications or organ ischemia.
3. Renal failure: Acute-on-chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in kidney function. This could require dialysis or renal transplant recovery.
4. Ileus: The patient's ileus can progress to bowel obstruction or perforation, potentially leading to serious complications such as peritonitis or sepsis.

   54 year old woman with lupus antiphospholipid and prior thrombotic
   microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA) as well as PAI deficiency,
   leading to pathologic bleeding and clotting, with resultant ESRD s/p
   renal transplant presenting with new acute renal failure; w/ acute
   pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of starting heparin after d/c
   warfarin.
   HYPERKALEMIA
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: due to acute lung injury, aspiration, pulmonary
   hemorrhage. Doing well on PS this AM. Bleeding on line sites prompted
   stop of heparin again.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin stopped
   as below.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: in setting of aspirating blood and ? serratia PNA.
   Levofloxacin completed
   - P/F improving as above
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Doing well on pressure support and SBT. Plan this AM to extubate. Note
   evolving events as the data for this note were imported into it;
   respiratory data above reflects end of trial of extubation. Reflecting
   AM assessment, decision to extubate based on excellent data, doing very
   well with good gasses on SBT as well as on minimal PS settings.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Essentially anuric. At this point her transplanted kidney is likely not
   to recover function, but still continuing immune suppression against
   rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue prednisone for renal and heme purposes
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. Heparin
   started and stopped after A-line bleeding. A-line bleeding continued
   through the night.
   -       plan this AM to pull A-line and hold pressure which we did; had
   held overnight in anticipation of needing multiple blood gasses
   pre-extubation.
   -          continue steroid tx
   -          follow LDH and smears
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient continuing to have improvement, though
   still not following commands. Sedation vs hypoxic brain injury earlier
   in course vs ?.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean sedation as able
   - holding psych meds for now
   STIFF LEGS: Increased motor tone has decreased in severity and she is
   moving her legs; however neuro exam remains abnormal.
   - C-spine MRI to follow up earlier evaluation
will schedule for today
   FEVER: Sputum cx w/ SERRATIA MARCESCENS.  No positive blood cultures.
   Completed treatment with levo.
   - culture if spikes, trend fever curve; afebrile recently
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.
   - cont amlodipine
   - metoprolol PO
   - start capropril and uptitrate as needed (okay per renal)
   - nitro drip as needed
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <160
   ABDOMINAL Ileus: Naloxone only with fentanyl sedation. No reglan b/c of
   past dystonic reaction.
   - Lactulose prn
   - Wean fentanyl as able
   - naloxone + bowel regimen as long as on fentanyl; laxatives/stool
   softeners alone if not
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of lupus antiphospholipid, prior thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMA), and post renal transplant presenting with new acute renal failure. She also has a history of hypertension and seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is due to acute lung injury, aspiration, and pulmonary hemorrhage. She has been experiencing bleeding from arterial line sites, and heparin was stopped as a result. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation but is doing well on pressure support and spontaneous breathing trials. However, she had a failed extubation attempt due to her weak condition.

The patient's altered mental status is improving, but she is still not following commands. She also has a history of ineffective coping, renal failure (acute on chronic), hypertension (benign), alteration in tissue perfusion, anemia (acute secondary to blood loss), and thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia (PAI inhibition).

Her laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, lactate, LDH, and creatinine. The patient has been diagnosed with TTP/HUS, acute pulmonary hemorrhage, acute lung injury, and acute renal failure.

Plan:
- Continue steroid therapy and monitor neurologic exam.
- Wean sedation as able and hold psych meds for now.
- Schedule C-spine MRI to follow up earlier evaluation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Plan as per resident note.
   Briefly, 54 year old woman with PMH as above who failed extubation
   yesterday likely secondary to weakness and possbile aspiration/mucous
   plugging. Now on minimal [**Year (4 digits) **] settings but unlikely to wean soon. Also
   concerned that she continues to have hemolysis as evidenced by
   declining hct, ongoing oozing, schistocytes on peripheral smear. She
   will not tolerate anticoagulation so will put this on hold
   indefinitely. Prn blood product support and will speak to heme re: any
   role for pheresis now. From a pulmonary standpoint she is stable on the
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wean O2 and pursue tracheostomy. Neurologicaly she certainly
   has a sig. component of myopathy and we should fairly urgently seek to
   decrease her steroid dose. Will t/b with heme and renal. Prelim on
   brain/c-spine MRI yesterday is negative so doubt central component to
   her weakness.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a renal transplant, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and deficiency of tissue plasminogen activator (TPAi) leading to bleeding diathesis. She presented with failure of the transplanted kidney and new-onset hemolysis, followed by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and later extubated but failed extubation within 45 minutes. She experienced continuous bleeding from the arterial line and now has bleeding from the peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) site. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and received various treatments including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain medication. Her vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/64 mmHg to 198/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus tachycardia as her heart rhythm. The patient's weight remains relatively stable. Fluid balance shows a significant deficit of 2,349 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient requires respiratory support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation."

She presented with failure of the transplanted kidney and new hemolysis, which led to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient experienced multiple episodes of bleeding, including from the PICC site and nasogastric (NG) tube. She required reintubation due to failed extubation.

24-hour events include failed extubation within 45 minutes, continuous bleeding from the arterial line, bleeding from the PICC site, coffee grounds from the NG tube, and the administration of 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

The patient has allergies to cephalexin, penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide. The last dose of antibiotics was given at 3:16 PM on 01/11/2118.

Infusions include fentanyl at 25 mcg/hour and propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include vecuronium, which was given at 2:00 PM on 01/13/2118.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/64 mmHg to 198/81 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 62 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,685 mL and total output of 4,034 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,349 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 380 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 33 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 103, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory values include hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 9.4-13.4 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 94-106 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 5.7-3.9 mg/dL"

   Briefly, 54 year old woman with PMH as above who failed extubation

   concerned that she continues to have hemolysis as evidenced by
   declining hct, ongoing oozing, schistocytes on peripheral smear. She
   will not tolerate anticoagulation so will put this on hold
   indefinitely. Prn blood product support and will speak to heme re: any
   role for pheresis now. From a pulmonary standpoint she is stable on the
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wean O2 and pursue tracheostomy. Neurologicaly she certainly
   has a sig. component of myopathy and we should fairly urgently seek to
   decrease her steroid dose. Will discuss with hem and renal services.
   Prelim on brain/c-spine MRI yesterday is negative so doubt central
   component to her weakness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and tissue plasminogen activator deficiency resulting in a bleeding diathesis. She presented with failure of the transplanted kidney and new hemolysis. The patient's course was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She required reintubation yesterday and has been experiencing ongoing bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's history of ESRD post renal transplant suggests an underlying kidney dysfunction. The failure of the transplanted kidney indicates a potential complication of renal failure.
2. Hemolysis: The presence of new hemolysis in the patient's condition can lead to further complications such as anemia, jaundice, and organ damage.
3. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding diathesis and ongoing oozing indicate an increased risk of bleeding complications. This can be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulation therapy.
4. ARDS: The patient's development of ARDS may lead to respiratory complications, including difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation and increased risk of infections.
5. Myopathy: The presence of significant myopathy can impact the patient's muscle strength and mobility, potentially leading to further complications such as pressure ul"

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a complicated medical history including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, alpha-thalassemia major (APLAS), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (TPAi) deficiency. She presented with failure of the transplanted kidney and new-onset hemolysis. The patient has a history of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient was initially intubated and received mechanical ventilation. She was sedated and required assistance for breathing. Her vital signs were stable, with a heart rate between 61-112 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 134/67 to 167/84 mmHg, respiratory rate between 32-48 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Laboratory results showed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 106 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels between 3.3-5.1 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at 591 IU/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and thrombophilia deficiency resulting in a bleeding diathesis. She presented with failure of the transplanted kidney and new-onset hemolysis. The patient experienced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation. She was extubated and re-intubated yesterday due to weakness and possible aspiration/mucous plugging.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has a history of ESRD post renal transplant, indicating previous kidney dysfunction. The current failure of the transplanted kidney may lead to further deterioration of renal function.
2. Hemolysis: The patient is experiencing new-onset hemolysis, as evidenced by declining hematocrit (Hct) levels and the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral smear. This condition can lead to anemia and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed promptly.
3. Bleeding diathesis: The patient's history of thrombophilia deficiency puts her at risk for bleeding complications. With reduced platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and prolonged clotting times (PTT), there is a higher likelihood of spontaneous bleeding or difficulty in managing bleeding during procedures.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and subsequent hemolysis.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but her heart rate and respiratory rate are slightly elevated. Her blood pressure is stable, and her oxygen saturation is good. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,489 mL, with significant amounts of IV fluids and blood products administered. Output includes urine, NG drainage, and stool. The patient has a positive fluid balance of 2,125 mL.

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 390 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. Her ABG results show mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL and a hematocrit of 28.4%. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 13.4 K/uL. Liver enzymes are within normal limits, while kidney function shows elevated creatinine levels of 3.3 and 4.3 mg/dL. Electrolyte imbalances are present, with low potassium and sodium levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, aplastic anemia (APLAS), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (TPAi) deficiency. The patient presented with renal failure and hemolysis, and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient experienced a diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She also had a bleeding diathesis due to TPAi deficiency, leading to failure of the transplanted kidney. The patient underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but experienced graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), resulting in the need for immunosuppressive therapy. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, weakness, ileus, renal failure, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently stable on the ventilator with minimal settings, but there is a plan to wean PEEP and pursue tracheostomy given the unlikely possibility of weaning due to weakness. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be partially related to sedation. Recent MRI brain was negative"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a complicated medical history including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, alpha-thalassemia major (APLAS), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and deficiency in tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (TPAi) resulting in bleeding diathesis. The patient has experienced failure of the transplanted kidney, new hemolysis, and has been diagnosed with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient was extubated and reintubated multiple times due to unsuccessful extubation attempts, likely secondary to weakness and possible aspiration/mucous plugging. 

The patient's hemolysis has been appropriately managed with a hematocrit bump yesterday after transfusion. Further monitoring of hemoglobin levels, blood smear, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is recommended. 

Due to the patient's bleeding risk, anticoagulation will be put on hold indefinitely. Hematological consultation suggests that pheresis is not indicated at this time. 

The patient is stable on the ventilator with minimal settings and will be weaned off peep. A tracheostomy is planned given the unlikely possibility of successful extubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] concerned due to weakness
   likely steroid myopathy. Evidence of patchy opacities consistent with
   aspiration s/p reintubation. RSBI now 63 but still not clear whether
   she would be able to get the strength to be extubated again. We have
   decreased steroid dosing with the hopes of improving strength but have
   to balance this vs. her hematologic issues, so we are not advancing the
   taper further yet.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No clear evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin
   off.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: completed course for serratia with levofloxacin
   -- culture if spikes
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   -- In theory she should get trach and PEG b/c of lengthy intubation
   (day [**1-15**] today); however, we share the concern that were she to have
   uncontrolled bleeding a trach could be very risky for her and for her
   the benefits of staying on an ETT outweigh the risks.
   -- Continuing PS, can try to wean down PEEP and PS further from here
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] to imagine
   that myopathy alone is responsible for this, but MRI brain and spine
   remain negative for acute processes. Picture seems more consistent with
   metabolic encephalopathy but she is being dialyzed
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean steroids per renal, heme/onc
   - holding psych meds for now
   - follow-up MRI head, c-spine
   ABDOMINAL Ileus:  Worsened this am. Continues to stool. Already on low
   dose fentanyl.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in NG tube
   - iv erythromycin
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Essentially anuric. At this point her transplanted kidney is likely not
   to recover function, but still continuing immune suppression against
   rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes and ask if can decrease
   to help with presumed myopathy
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition.  Continues
   to ooze blood via PICC and with suctioning. s/p another 2 units FFP.
   Increased schistocytes per heme/onc.
   -          continue steroid tx
 ask heme/one if can decrease
   -         ? plasmapheresis for hemolytic anemia
   -          follow LDH and smears
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - stop amlodipine
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <160
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has failed extubation due to weakness likely caused by steroid myopathy. There is evidence of patchy opacities consistent with aspiration after reintubation. The patient's Respiratory Supportability Index (RSBI) is 63, but it is still unclear whether she will be able to regain strength to be extubated again. The tapering of steroid dosing has been decreased to improve strength, but this needs to be balanced with her hematologic issues.

2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: There is no clear evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin has been discontinued.

3. Acute Lung Injury: The patient has completed the course of serratia with levofloxacin. Culture results are pending.

4. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient is still intubated and requires prolonged mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) have been consulted for early next week. However, there are concerns about uncontrolled bleeding if a tracheostomy is performed.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains unclear. An MRI of the brain and spine showed no acute processes."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] concerned due to weakness
   likely steroid myopathy. Evidence of patchy opacities consistent with
   aspiration s/p reintubation. RSBI now 63 but still not clear whether
   she would be able to get the strength to be extubated again. We have
   decreased steroid dosing with the hopes of improving strength but have
   to balance this vs. her hematologic issues, so we are not advancing the
   taper further yet.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin
   off.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: completed course for serratia with levofloxacin
   -- culture if spikes
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   -- In theory she should get trach and PEG b/c of lengthy intubation
   (day [**1-15**] today); however, we share the concern that were she to have
   uncontrolled bleeding a trach could be very risky for her and for her
   the benefits of staying on an ETT outweigh the risks.
   -- Continuing PS, can try to wean down PEEP and PS further from here
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   remain negative for acute processes. Picture seems more consistent with
   metabolic encephalopathy but she is being dialyzed and has no clear
   infectious process so the source of this would be unclear. MRI and
   C-spine are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities
   that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean steroids per our discussions with our valued consulting teams
   - still holding psych meds for now
   - follow metabolic labs, intermittently follow liver labs
   ABDOMINAL Ileus:  Worsened this am. Continues to stool. Already on low
   dose fentanyl.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in NG tube
   - iv erythromycin
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Essentially anuric. At this point her transplanted kidney is likely not
   to recover function, but still continuing immune suppression against
   rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes and ask if can decrease
   to help with presumed myopathy
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition.  Continues
   to ooze blood via PICC and with suctioning. s/p another 2 units FFP.
   Increased schistocytes per heme/onc.
   -          continue steroid tx
 ask heme/one if can decrease
   -         ? plasmapheresis for hemolytic anemia
   -          follow LDH and smears
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - stop amlodipine
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - goal BP <160
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: holding psych meds for now to simplify regimen.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure. She has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's mental status is unclear, likely contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. The cause of her apparent deficit is not fully explained by myopathy alone, but an MRI of the brain and spine has shown no acute processes.

The patient has an ileus, which has worsened this morning. She is currently receiving low-dose fentanyl and will be given lactulose and naloxone through her nasogastric tube. Additionally, she will receive intravenous erythromycin and continue with a bowel regimen.

The patient's transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but immune suppression against rejection will continue. She is on a hemodialysis schedule of Saturday and Tuesday/Thursday. 

The patient continues to have a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, PAI inhibition. She is oozing blood via PICC and with suctioning. She received another 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. Increased schistocytes are present on the blood smear.

The patient's hypertension is controlled with captopril. She will stop taking amlodipine and continue with metoprolol and captopril. The goal blood pressure is less than 160.

The patient's anemia is due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] concerned due to weakness
   likely steroid myopathy. Evidence of patchy opacities consistent with
   aspiration s/p reintubation. RSBI now 63 but still not clear whether
   she would be able to get the strength to be extubated again. We have
   decreased steroid dosing with the hopes of improving strength but have
   to balance this vs. her hematologic issues, so we are not advancing the
   taper further yet.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin
   off.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: completed course for serratia with levofloxacin
   -- culture if spikes
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   -- In theory she should get trach and PEG b/c of lengthy intubation
   (day [**1-15**] today); however, we share the concern that were she to have
   uncontrolled bleeding a trach could be very risky for her and for her
   the benefits of staying on an ETT outweigh the risks.
   -- Continuing PS, can try to wean down PEEP and PS further from here
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   remain negative for acute processes. Picture seems more consistent with
   metabolic encephalopathy but she is being dialyzed and has no clear
   infectious process so the source of this would be unclear. MRI and
   C-spine are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities
   that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean steroids per our discussions with our valued consulting teams
   - still holding psych meds for now
   - follow metabolic labs, intermittently follow liver labs
   ABDOMINAL Ileus:  Stooling. No residuals. Back on fentanyl so starting
   naloxone OG again.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; reduced dose as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Still holding psych meds to simplify regimen.

   Assessment and Plan
   Plan as per resident note.
   Briefly, 54 yo F w/PMHx of SLE, ESRD s/p renal transplant, APLAS, TMA,
   TPAi deficiency and resulting bleeding diathesis p/w failure of
   transplanted kidney, new hemolysis. Course c/b DAH and resulting ARDS.
   s/p failed extubation [**1-14**] likely secondary to weakness and possible
   aspiration/mucous plugging.
   -Hemolysis- appropriate hct bump yest post tf, follow Hct/smear/LDH, tf
   for Hct <25.  She will not tolerate anticoagulation so will put this on
   hold indefinitely.  Per heme, no role for pheresis [**3-6**] bleeding risk
   (bleeding rather than clotting is [**Last Name 1588**] problem).
   -Respiratory failure- she is stable on the vent w/minimal settings,
   will wean peep and pursue tracheostomy given unlikely to wean
   w/weakness.  No new e/o pulmonary hemorrhage.  s/p course of abx for
   serratia.
   -Altered mental status- recent MRI brain negative for bleed/infarct.
   Maybe partially sedation related, will try to wean fentanyl today.  No
   clear source of infection to explain.  Will send delta MS [**Last Name (Titles) **].  ?need
   for EEG (doubt sz).  F/u neuro recs.
   -Weakness- sig component of myopathy, tapering steroids. Brain/c-spine
   MRI negative so doubt central component to her weakness.
   -Ileus- bowel regimen, po narcan
   -FEN- tolerating TF, advance to goal of 25cc/hr
   -Renal failure, anuric- cont HD, tapering steroids, cont cellcept,
   renal following
   -HTN- BP control decent on BB and ACEI, goal SBP<160.

   TPAi deficiency and resulting bleeding diathesis p/w failure of
   transplanted kidney, new hemolysis. Course c/b DAH and resulting ARDS.
   s/p failed extubation [**1-14**] likely secondary to weakness and possible
   aspiration/mucous plugging.
   -Hemolysis- Hct stable on past several checks, follow Hct/smear/LDH, tf
   for Hct <25.
   -Respiratory failure- she is currently stable on the vent w/minimal
   settings.  Plan has been to pursue tracheostomy (would need to be open
   trach per IP) given unlikely to wean w/weakness (+poor MS), but high
   risk for bleeding w/hematologic abnl
  Will try to wean PS today.
   -Altered mental status- recent MRI brain negative for bleed/infarct.
   Maybe partially sedation related, will try to wean propofol today.
   Will d/w psych restarting her antipsychotic to help w/agitation while
   weaning sedation.  No clear source of infection or electrolyte abnl to
   explain delta MS.
   [**Name14 (STitle) 7017**]- sig component of myopathy, tapering steroids. Brain/c-spine
   MRI negative so doubt central component to her weakness.
   -APLAS- AC on hold indefinitely as has not tolerated from bleeding
   standpoint.
   -Ileus- increased residuals last night, requiring TF to be held.  Cont
   po narcan, add standing lactulose.
   -FEN- keep TF at slow rate given residuals.
   -Renal failure, anuric- cont HD, tapering steroids, cont cellcept,
   renal following.
   AG ~20, likely [**3-6**] renal failure but will check lactate.
   Hyponatremia likely hypervolemic [**3-6**] renal failure, stable.
   -HTN- cont BB and ACEI for goal SBP<160- on current regimen, BP only
   >160 when in pain/agitated.

The patient also experienced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Overnight, the patient was hypertensive and agitated, so fentanyl boluses and propofol were given. The patient's allergies include Keflex (oral), penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, Compazine (oral), and Reglan (oral). The last dose of antibiotics was given.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/64-182/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1633 mL and output of 3038 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1405 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 369 mL, positive end-expiratory"

   Plan as per resident note.
   Briefly, 54 yo F w/PMHx of SLE, ESRD s/p renal transplant, APLAS, TMA,
   TPAi deficiency and resulting bleeding diathesis p/w failure of
   transplanted kidney, new hemolysis. Course c/b DAH and resulting ARDS.
   s/p failed extubation [**1-14**] likely secondary to weakness and possible
   aspiration/mucous plugging.
   -Hemolysis- appropriate hct bump yest post tf, follow Hct/smear/LDH, tf
   for Hct <25.  She will not tolerate anticoagulation so will put this on
   hold indefinitely.  Per heme, no role for pheresis [**3-6**] bleeding risk
   (bleeding rather than clotting is [**Last Name 1588**] problem).
   -Respiratory failure- she is stable on the vent w/minimal settings,
   will wean peep and pursue tracheostomy given unlikely to wean
   w/weakness.  No new e/o pulmonary hemorrhage.  s/p course of abx for
   serratia.
   -Altered mental status- recent MRI brain negative for bleed/infarct.
   Maybe partially sedation related, will try to wean fentanyl today.  No
   clear source of infection to explain.  Will send delta MS [**Last Name (Titles) **].  ?need
   for EEG (doubt sz).  F/u neuro recs.
   -Weakness- sig component of myopathy, tapering steroids. Brain/c-spine
   MRI negative so doubt central component to her weakness.
   -Ileus- bowel regimen, po narcan
   -FEN- tolerating TF, advance to goal of 25cc/hr
   -Renal failure, anuric- cont HD, tapering steroids, cont cellcept,
   renal following
   -HTN- BP control decent on BB and ACEI, goal SBP<160.

The patient also had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DAH) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, weakness, ileus, renal failure, anuria, hypertension, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure within normal ranges, normal heart rate, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient is intubated and sedated, with limited response to commands. Physical examination reveals anterior chest tube in place, normal-sized and regular heart sounds, soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and no significant edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or show no significant abnormalities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a complex medical history including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-renal transplant, aplastic anemia, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (TPAi) deficiency. She presents with failure of the transplanted kidney, new hemolysis, and a history of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was extubated and re-intubated multiple times.

The patient's current condition includes hypertension and agitation, requiring sedation and pain management. She is intubated and sedated, opening her eyes to voice but not following commands. She has a chest tube on the left anteriorly and rhonchi on the right anteriorly. Her abdomen is soft, with no tenderness, normal bowel sounds, and positive blood sugar (BS).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in coagulation factors (PT/PTT/INR), liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and kidney function tests (creatinine/Cr).

   Assessment and Plan
   Plan as per resident note.
   Briefly, 54 yo F w/PMHx of SLE, ESRD s/p renal transplant, APLAS, TMA,
   TPAi deficiency and resulting bleeding diathesis p/w failure of
   transplanted kidney, new hemolysis. Course c/b DAH and resulting ARDS.
   s/p failed extubation [**1-14**] likely secondary to weakness and possible
   aspiration/mucous plugging.
   -Hemolysis- appropriate hct bump yest post tf, follow Hct/smear/LDH, tf
   for Hct <25.  She will not tolerate anticoagulation so will put this on
   hold indefinitely.  Per heme, no role for pheresis [**3-6**] bleeding risk
   (bleeding rather than clotting is [**Last Name 1588**] problem).
   -Respiratory failure- she is stable on the vent w/minimal settings,
   will wean peep and pursue tracheostomy given unlikely to wean
   w/weakness.  No new e/o pulmonary hemorrhage.  s/p course of abx for
   serratia.
   -Altered mental status- recent MRI brain negative for bleed/infarct.
   Maybe partially sedation related, will try to wean fentanyl today.  No
   clear source of infection to explain.  Will send delta MS [**Last Name (Titles) **].  ?need
   for EEG (doubt sz).  F/u neuro recs.
   -Weakness- sig component of myopathy, tapering steroids. Brain/c-spine
   MRI negative so doubt central component to her weakness.
   -Ileus- bowel regimen, po narcan
   -FEN- tolerating TF, advance to goal of 25cc/hr
   -Renal failure, anuric- cont HD, tapering steroids, cont cellcept,
   renal following
   -HTN- BP control decent on BB and ACEI, goal SBP<160.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a complicated medical history including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, aplastic anemia, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (TPAi) deficiency resulting in bleeding diathesis. The patient's current condition includes failure of the transplanted kidney, new hemolysis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and repeated intubations.

24-hour events include allergies to certain medications, infusions of propofol, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, but there have been fluctuations in fluid balance due to ongoing dialysis treatments. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal settings and is stable.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in kidney function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and coagulation factors. The patient has been receiving various treatments including hemolysis management, respiratory support, sedation, bowel regimen, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemolysis: The patient has new hemolysis, which may continue to affect her red blood cell count and overall oxygen-carrying capacity.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] concerned due to weakness
   likely steroid myopathy. Evidence of patchy opacities consistent with
   aspiration s/p reintubation. RSBI 71, similar to yesterday (63), but
   still not clear whether she would be able to get the strength to be
   extubated again. We have decreased steroid dosing with the hopes of
   improving strength but have to balance this vs. her hematologic issues,
   so we are not advancing the taper further yet.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin
   off.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: completed course for serratia with levofloxacin
   -- culture if spikes
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   -- In theory she should get trach and PEG b/c of lengthy intubation
   (day 13-14 today); however, we share the concern that were she to have
   uncontrolled bleeding a trach could be very risky for her and for her
   the benefits of staying on an ETT may outweigh the risks.
   -- Discuss trach+PEG planning and contingency plans with IP and
   thoracics
   -- Continuing PS, can try to wean down PEEP and PS further from here
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean steroids per our discussions with our valued consulting teams
   - still holding psych meds for now, but as below will consider
   restarting
   - follow metabolic labs, intermittently follow liver labs
   ABDOMINAL Ileus:  Stooling. No residuals. With fentanyl have added
   naloxone; trying to minimize fentanyl exposure with boluses.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; reduced dose as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA AND ANION GAP
   Most likely secondary to renal failure, fluid shifts.
   -          Check lactate today to r/o lactic acidosis
   -          Continue to emphasize putting meds in normal saline to
   reduce amount of free water given
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Have been holding psych meds to simplify regimen.
   Possible that mental status will improve if we uptitrate these meds.
   Will endeavor to discuss this with her outpatient psychiatrist and/or
   psych c/s here.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and renal failure.
- She has been intubated for 13 days and has been receiving mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's mental status is unclear, and she may have steroid myopathy contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction.
- She has patchy opacities consistent with aspiration after reintubation.
- The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 369 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%.
- She is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube.
- The patient has acute hemolytic anemia, thrombotic microangiopathy, and PAI inhibition.
- She has hypertension that is being managed with medication.
- Her electrolytes are imbalanced, particularly with hyponatremia and anion gap.
- The patient is anemic and requires transfusion to maintain a hematocrit level above 25%.
- She has a history of allergies to certain medications.
- The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various medications and treatments are being administered to address her multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and prolonged intubation, she is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation disorder increases the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hematoma formation.
3. Renal Failure: Acute kidney injury may progress to chronic renal failure, requiring ongoing renal replacement therapy such as dialysis.
4. Hemolytic Anemia: The patient's ongoing hemolysis can lead to anemia and further complications such as congestive heart failure or cardiac arrest if not managed appropriately.
5. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: This condition poses a risk for thrombotic events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease.
6. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension can result in end-organ damage, including stroke, heart attack, or kidney injury.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and anion gap can lead to neurological complications, cardiac arrhythmias, and muscle weakness.
8. Infection: Prolonged intubation and immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and catheter-related infections.
9. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can complicate care, increase the risk of falls, and prolong recovery.
10. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and coagulopathy put the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a complex bleeding/clotting disorder, pulmonary hemorrhage, and failure to wean from ventilator. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, morphine, Compazine, and Reglan. The patient's current medications include propofol, hydralazine, fentanyl, and Cellcept. 

24-hour events include family meeting, stabilization of hematocrit (HCT), consultation with thoracic surgery regarding tracheostomy, hyponatremia that responded to normal saline (NS), low urine output, and unsuccessful attempt to wean from the ventilator.

Vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4Â°C (99.3Â°F)
- Heart rate: 67 bpm (62-95 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 114/57 mmHg (70/103-172/91 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (11-24 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,523 mL and a total output of 44 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,479 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and"

   (HUS/TTP)
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength and are tapering further
   today to 20 mg.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   We are planning to proceed with trach given that risk of reintubation
   is also considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to
   wean from the vent. Therefore trach in the OR in a controlled setting
   is likely safer. We will discuss with thoracics, her renal MD, and her
   family today.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   ABDOMINAL Ileus:  Stooling. Minimal residuals. Continuing nalaxone,
   lactulose.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; reduced dose as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule but as below consider
   more frequent dialysis given apparent acidemia and hyponatremia
   - VBG and lytes after rounds
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA AND ANION GAP
   Most likely secondary to renal failure, fluid shifts.
   -          Lactate was negative; no evidence of lactic acidosis
   -          Continue to emphasize putting meds in normal saline to
   reduce amount of free water given
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarting ziprasidone. Might consider a stimulant
   as a next step; anti-depressants unlikely to be helpful in current
   course although her bupropion could conceivably have an activating
   effect.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy), and renal failure. She has failed extubation likely due to weakness, possibly steroid myopathy. The patient's mental status is unclear, and an MRI brain and spine show non-specific abnormalities that do not explain the global nature of her deficits. She also has acute on chronic renal failure with graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy. The patient's transplanted kidney is unlikely to recover function, but immune suppression will continue against rejection for now. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of reintubation due to weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging.
2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of pulmonary hemorrhage, and there is a risk of recurrence. Heparin has been stopped, and tracheostomy is being considered in a controlled setting.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy. She requires dialysis, and more frequent dialysis may be necessary given the apparent acidemia and hyponatremia.
4. Thrombotic Disorder with Hemolytic Anemia: The patient has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, and PA"

 THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA / HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME
   (HUS/TTP)
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] concerned due to weakness
   likely steroid myopathy. Evidence of patchy opacities consistent with
   aspiration s/p reintubation. RSBI 71, similar to yesterday (63), but
   still not clear whether she would be able to get the strength to be
   extubated again. We have decreased steroid dosing with the hopes of
   improving strength but have to balance this vs. her hematologic issues,
   so we are not advancing the taper further yet.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage. Heparin
   off.
   * ACUTE LUNG INJURY: completed course for serratia with levofloxacin
   -- culture if spikes
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   -- In theory she should get trach and PEG b/c of lengthy intubation
   (day 13-14 today); however, we share the concern that were she to have
   uncontrolled bleeding a trach could be very risky for her and for her
   the benefits of staying on an ETT may outweigh the risks.
   -- Discuss trach+PEG planning and contingency plans with IP and
   thoracics
   -- Continuing PS, can try to wean down PEEP and PS further from here
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - continue to monitor neurologic exam
   - wean steroids per our discussions with our valued consulting teams
   - still holding psych meds for now, but as below will consider
   restarting
   - follow metabolic labs, intermittently follow liver labs
   ABDOMINAL Ileus:  Stooling. No residuals. With fentanyl have added
   naloxone; trying to minimize fentanyl exposure with boluses.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; reduced dose as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior

   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active

   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA AND ANION GAP
   Most likely secondary to renal failure, fluid shifts.
   -          Check lactate today to r/o lactic acidosis
   -          Continue to emphasize putting meds in normal saline to
   reduce amount of free water given
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Have been holding psych meds to simplify regimen.
   Possible that mental status will improve if we uptitrate these meds.
   Will endeavor to discuss this with her outpatient psychiatrist and/or
   psych c/s here.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and renal failure. She has been intubated for 13 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of thrombotic microangiopathy, hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. She also has hypertension, hyponatremia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing need for mechanical ventilation. There is concern about her ability to be successfully extubated due to weakness, possibly related to steroid myopathy.
2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient had a previous episode of pulmonary hemorrhage, but there is currently no evidence of new bleeding. Heparin has been discontinued.
3. Acute Lung Injury: The patient completed treatment for Serratia infection with levofloxacin. There are concerns about potential complications such as mechanical ventilation-associated pneumonia.
4. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient has a history of thrombotic microangiopathy, which can lead to further organ damage and complications.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function remains compromised, requiring ongoing dialysis support.
6. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which needs to be managed carefully to prevent further complications.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, likely secondary to renal failure and fluid shifts"

   54 year old woman with PMH SLE, TMA, renal failure, and respiratory
   failure . Continues with fairly minimal vent settings, clear imaging,
   and acceptable RISBI.
   Still with substantial weakness on exam and suspected steroid myopathy.
   Weaninf prednisone as rapidly as practical in the setting of low level
   ongoing hemolysis. Failed relatively quickly with trial of extubation
   last week. Would favor tracheostomy over addtional attempt at
   extubation despite favorable numbers. She has an indication for
   anticoagulation (antiphospholipid ab) but bleeding risk remains
   unacceptably high based on events during this ICU stay. Will check NIF
   today on minimal sedation and pursue tracheostomy with thoracics.
   Further plans as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), renal failure, and respiratory failure. She presented with new renal failure, hemolysis, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has failed extubation once and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and previous failed extubation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal Complications: The patient has a history of renal failure and is currently experiencing new renal failure. There is a risk of worsening renal function, which could lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
3. Hematological Complications: The patient is experiencing hemolysis, which can result in anemia, jaundice, and increased risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.
4. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged stay in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient may be at risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial inf"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a complex bleeding/clotting disorder who is currently in the ICU. The patient experienced a pulmonary hemorrhage and is having difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient underwent a family meeting where it was agreed upon to perform a tracheostomy. The patient is NPO since midnight for the tracheostomy procedure. Cellcept has been changed from IV to PO, and ziprasidone (Geodon) has been restarted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to assess the patient's respiratory status.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolytes, and fluid balance is necessary. The patient may require renal replacement therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Appropriate hemodynamic monitoring and administration of vasopressor agents may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Bleeding/clotting disorder: The patient has a history of a complex bleeding/clotting disorder. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters such as PT/PTT/INR is essential. Prophylactic measures like platelet transfusions or administration of clotting factors may be necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Thrombotic thrombocytopen"

   too high risk for anticoagulation at this time given multiple bleeding
   complications during this admit
   but LDH trendign down, Plts trending up so may be able to re-introduce
   heparin at some point post-trach. Continues on HD.  Further plans as

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with thrombocytopenia and hemolysis, which has led to hypoxemic respiratory failure and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation settings but failed extubation once and is likely going for tracheostomy today.

The patient has multiple allergies, including to cephalexin, penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide. The last dose of antibiotics was administered.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/84 mmHg to 180/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 46.6 kg, with a total fluid input of 1,000 mL, including 625 mL of intravenous fluids. The patient's urine output is 60 mL, and the balance is 940 mL.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following renal transplantation, and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with dyspnea, hemolysis, and hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation. The patient has experienced multiple complications during her admission, including bleeding events while on anticoagulation therapy. Her current condition is characterized by profound weakness, likely due to steroid/ICU myopathy, as well as fever, which has prompted the consideration of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/84 to 180/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and body temperature within normal limits. Physical examination reveals clear lungs with a small amount of tan secretions, soft and slightly distended abdomen, and no rash or inflamed joints. Laboratory findings show anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and liver enzymes, with a decreasing trend in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with complicated coagulopathy, respiratory failure
   [**3-6**] DAH and now profound weakness. Weakness thought secondary to
   steroid/ICU myopathy. Now
   weaning steroids and plan for tracheostomy today. I believe she remains
   too high risk for anticoagulation at this time given multiple bleeding
   complications during this admit
   but LDH trendign down, Plts trending up so may be able to re-introduce
   heparin at some point post-trach. Continues on HD.  Further plans as
   per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with thrombocytopenia and hemolysis, and her course is complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). She is currently on minimal ventilation settings and has failed extubation once. She is likely going to undergo a tracheostomy today.

The patient has allergies to cephalexin, penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide. Her last dose of antibiotics was on [date]. She is receiving propofol infusion at 40 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications as needed.

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent development of respiratory distress. Her flow sheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 166/84 to 180/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, white blood cell count of 8.9 K"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength and are tapering further
   today to 20 mg.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   We are planning to proceed with trach given that risk of reintubation
   is also considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to
   wean from the vent. Therefore trach in the OR in a controlled setting
   is likely safer. We will discuss with thoracics, her renal MD, and her
   family today.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   ABDOMINAL Ileus:  Stooling. Minimal residuals. Continuing nalaxone,
   lactulose.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; reduced dose as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule but as below consider
   more frequent dialysis given apparent acidemia and hyponatremia
   - VBG and lytes after rounds
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA AND ANION GAP
   Most likely secondary to renal failure, fluid shifts.
   -          Lactate was negative; no evidence of lactic acidosis
   -          Continue to emphasize putting meds in normal saline to
   reduce amount of free water given
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarting ziprasidone. Might consider a stimulant
   as a next step; anti-depressants unlikely to be helpful in current
   course although her bupropion could conceivably have an activating
   effect.

The RSBI is 89, and we have decreased steroid dosing with the hopes of improving strength and are tapering further today to 20 mg.

The patient also has pulmonary hemorrhage, but no current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name**]. Heparin is off.

Mechanical ventilation: The patient will proceed with tracheostomy given the risk of reintubation and the inability to reliably wean from the vent. Tracheostomy in the OR in a controlled setting is likely safer. We will discuss with thoracics, her renal MD, and her family today.

Altered mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.

Abdominal ileus: Stooling is minimal residuals. Continuing naloxone, lactulose. Instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube. IV erythromycin as needed. Continue bowel regimen.

Acute on chronic renal failure: Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a complex bleeding/clotting disorder leading to renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is currently unable to be weaned from the ventilator. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and is currently receiving multiple medications in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have fluctuations in blood pressure. The patient's neurological status is altered, and they are unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, renal failure, respiratory failure, anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS/TTP), and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Inability to wean from the ventilator: The patient's respiratory failure may make it difficult to remove the ventilator support, increasing the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding/clotting disorder increases the risk of bleeding complications such as internal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's renal failure indicates impaired kidney function, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for dialysis.
4. Infection: Prolonged immobility, invasive lines, and compromised immune system due to medications can increase the risk of infections like"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength; we will .
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   We are planning to proceed with trach given that risk of reintubation
   is also considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to
   wean from the vent. Therefore trach in the OR in a controlled setting
   is likely safer. We will discuss with thoracics, her renal MD, and her
   family today.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   ABDOMINAL Ileus:  Stooling. Minimal residuals. Continuing nalaxone,
   lactulose.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; reduced dose as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule but as below consider
   more frequent dialysis given apparent acidemia and hyponatremia
   - VBG and lytes after rounds
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA AND ANION GAP
   Most likely secondary to renal failure, fluid shifts.
   -          Lactate was negative; no evidence of lactic acidosis
   -          Continue to emphasize putting meds in normal saline to
   reduce amount of free water given
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarting ziprasidone. Might consider a stimulant
   as a next step; anti-depressants unlikely to be helpful in current
   course although her bupropion could conceivably have an activating
   effect.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure. She has a history of multiple complications, including pulmonary hemorrhage, altered mental status, abdominal ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, hypertension, hyponatremia, anemia, and depression/anxiety.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to weakness, likely steroid myopathy. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is planned for a tracheostomy due to the risk of reintubation and inability to wean from the ventilator. Her altered mental status remains unclear, and myopathy may be contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. MRI brain and spine have shown non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, with graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy. Her transplanted kidney is unlikely to recover function, but immune suppression against rejection is being continued. The patient's thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia and PAI inhibition is ongoing, with no significant bleeding observed.

Other issues include hypertension, hyponatremia, anemia, and depression/anxiety. The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with metoprolol and captopril, and medications are being administered in normal saline to reduce free water intake"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength; we will titrate down
   further; going to 10 mg daily starting in the AM.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   We are planning to proceed with trach given that risk of reintubation
   is also considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to
   wean from the vent. Therefore trach in the OR in a controlled setting
   is likely safer. Plan for thoracics to do this today after family
   meeting yesterday to discuss.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - follow metabolic labs, continue HD; I see no pattern in mental status
   pre- and post-HD so renal failure not likely a major contributor, but
   continue to follow this
   - hyponatremia has been marked for some time now; possible that
   improving this will improve mental status; see below
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Some stool. Some residuals overnight. Continuing
   nalaxone, lactulose.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule but as below consider
   more frequent dialysis given apparent acidemia and hyponatremia
   - VBG and lytes after rounds
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Most likely secondary to renal failure, fluid shifts. Changed CellCept
   to PO. Hoping this plus continued HD will be helpful, may need to
   consider daily HD if hyponatremia does not improve as this may be
   contributing to mental status.
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarting ziprasidone. Might consider a stimulant
   as a next step; anti-depressants unlikely to be helpful in current
   course although her bupropion could conceivably have an activating
   effect.

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to weakness, likely caused by steroid myopathy. There is no evidence of new pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient also has abdominal ileus, with some stool and residuals overnight. She is being given lactulose and naloxone through the OG tube. Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but immune suppression against rejection is being continued. 

She has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, PAI inhibition, and no significant bleeding today. Her hypertension is being controlled with metoprolol and captopril. She also has hyponatremia, anemia, depression/anxiety, and is being treated accordingly.

 THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA / HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME
   (HUS/TTP)
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength; we will titrate down
   further; going to 10 mg daily starting in the AM.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   We are planning to proceed with trach given that risk of reintubation
   is also considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to
   wean from the vent. Therefore trach in the OR in a controlled setting
   is likely safer. Plan for thoracics to do this today after family
   meeting yesterday to discuss.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - follow metabolic labs, continue HD; I see no pattern in mental status
   pre- and post-HD so renal failure not likely a major contributor, but
   continue to follow this
   - hyponatremia has been marked for some time now; possible that
   improving this will improve mental status; see below
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Some stool. Some residuals overnight. Continuing
   nalaxone, lactulose.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule but as below consider
   more frequent dialysis given apparent acidemia and hyponatremia
   - VBG and lytes after rounds
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Most likely secondary to renal failure, fluid shifts. Changed CellCept
   to PO. Hoping this plus continued HD will be helpful, may need to
   consider daily HD if hyponatremia does not improve as this may be
   contributing to mental status.
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200).
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarting ziprasidone. Might consider a stimulant
   as a next step; anti-depressants unlikely to be helpful in current
   course although her bupropion could conceivably have an activating
   effect.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI def.), and renal failure. She has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to her inability to wean off the ventilator. The patient also has altered mental status, anemia, hypertension, and hypotension.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or bleeding.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation likely due to weakness, possibly steroid myopathy. The RSBI is low, and steroids have been tapered down with plans to continue titrating further.
3. Mechanical Ventilation: The plan is to proceed with tracheostomy given the risk of reintubation and the inability to reliably predict weaning from the ventilator.
4. Altered Mental Status: Mental status remains unclear, and myopathy is contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. MRI brain and spine show non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute renal failure with graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy. Immune suppression is being continued against rejection for now.
6. Thrombotic Disorder with Hemolytic Anemia: The patient has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, PAI inhibition, and no significant bleeding today. Steroid therapy is being continued"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing a complex bleeding/clotting disorder, which has led to pulmonary hemorrhage and respiratory failure. The patient is currently unable to be weaned off the ventilator. The note mentions that the patient had a fever yesterday afternoon, so antibiotics (Vanc/cipro/flagyl) were started, and hemodialysis (HD) was performed. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, dicloxacillin, and morphine, as well as unknown reactions to Compazine and Reglan. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 C (101 F) at the maximum, blood pressure ranging from 112/47 mmHg to 180/98 mmHg, heart rate between 62-109 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's weight is currently 46.6 kg, with a fluid balance showing an intake of 1,478 mL and output of 274 mL. 

Respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 339 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 62. 

Laboratory results show leukocyte count within normal range, hemoglobin at 9.8 g/dL"

 THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA / HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME
   (HUS/TTP)
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength; we will titrate down
   further; going to 10 mg daily starting in the AM.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, new LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   - Treating with vancomycin and meropenem and cipro per discussion on
   rounds.
   - Follow cultures closely to try to peel off antibiotics
   - Follow CXRs
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   We are planning to proceed with trach given that risk of reintubation
   is also considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to
   wean from the vent. Deferred for fever yesterday. Will discuss
   rescheduling and replanning with thoracics. Very much appreciate their
   involvement.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - follow metabolic labs, continue HD; I see no pattern in mental status
   pre- and post-HD so renal failure not likely a major contributor, but
   continue to follow this
   - improvement in hyponatremia has not made a significant difference in
   mental status
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  A bit more distended today. Small amount of stool.
   Continuing nalaxone, lactulose.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   - VBG and lytes after rounds
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Resolved for now. Follow.
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200). Still with ongoing Hct drops but not acute or
   dangerous.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The key findings from the progress note are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is unable to wean off mechanical ventilation, likely due to weakness, possibly related to steroid myopathy. The RSBI (respiratory system compliance and frequency of spontaneous breathing) is 62, indicating the need for continued ventilatory support.

2. Ventilator-acquired pneumonia: After 14+ days on mechanical ventilation, the patient developed new left lower lobe consolidation, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia. She is being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and cipro.

3. Pulmonary hemorrhage: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or bleeding is observed. Heparin remains off, indicating no anticoagulation therapy for now.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely contributes to muscular weakness/dysfunction. An MRI brain and spine showed non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits. The mental status is not improving despite improvement in hyponatremia and renal failure.

5. Abdominal ileus: The patient has a bit more distension today, with small amounts of stool. She is receiving lactulose and naloxone through the OG tube, and erythromycin IV as needed for bowel motility.

6. Acute on chronic renal failure:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of complex coagulopathy, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and persistent ventilator dependence.
- She has been in the ICU and is currently awaiting a tracheostomy and weaning of steroids.
- The patient developed a fever (Tm 101) and has pending cultures. Her sputum gram stain showed 4+ GNR.
- She has a known allergy to penicillins, morphine, and certain medications causing dystonia or Parkinsonism.
- Her last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 06:38 PM on 01/18/2118.
- The patient is currently on propofol infusion at 50 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications.
- Flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of VAP, as indicated by her fever and positive sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR. This can lead to worsening respiratory function and potentially sepsis.

2. Tracheostomy complications: The patient is awaiting a tracheostomy, which carries the risk of bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding structures.

3. Steroid myopathy: The patient's prolonged use of steroids may lead to muscle weakness and difficulty weaning off the ventil"

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with complex coagulopathy, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and persistent ventilator dependence. She is currently in the ICU and awaiting tracheostomy. The patient has experienced fever, and cultures are pending. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, Compazine, and Reglan. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3Â°C (101Â°F), blood pressure ranging from 112/47 mmHg to 164/98 mmHg, heart rate between 62-109 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 50 kg to 46.6 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,478 mL and output of 274 mL. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and other ICU medications. She is also on hemodialysis.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current condition includes prolonged ventilator dependence, critical illness/steroid myopathy, and new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is awaiting tracheostomy and weaning off steroids. The patient will start an empiric VAP regimen of vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. She requires long-term anticoagulation due to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) but will continue"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength; we will titrate down
   further; going to 10 mg daily starting in the AM.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, new LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   - Treating with vancomycin and meropenem and cipro per discussion on
   rounds.
   - Follow cultures closely to try to peel off antibiotics
   - Follow CXRs
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   We are planning to proceed with trach given that risk of reintubation
   is also considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to
   wean from the vent. Deferred for fever yesterday. Will discuss
   rescheduling and replanning with thoracics. Very much appreciate their
   involvement.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - follow metabolic labs, continue HD; I see no pattern in mental status
   pre- and post-HD so renal failure not likely a major contributor, but
   continue to follow this
   - improvement in hyponatremia has not made a significant difference in
   mental status
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  A bit more distended today. Small amount of stool.
   Continuing nalaxone, lactulose.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   - VBG and lytes after rounds
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Resolved for now. Follow.
   ANEMIA
   Patient with known acute hemolytic anemia. LDH continuing to decline
   (highest was 2200). Still with ongoing Hct drops but not acute or
   dangerous.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25.
   - If bleeding, give FFP.
   - Guaiac stools
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure.
- She failed extubation due to weakness, likely caused by steroid myopathy. Steroid dosing has been decreased, and further titration will be done.
- The patient has developed ventilator-acquired pneumonia after 14+ days on the ventilator, with new left lower lobe consolidation and fever. She is being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin.
- There is no current evidence of new pulmonary hemorrhage.
- The patient requires tracheostomy due to the risk of reintubation and inability to wean from the ventilator.
- Her mental status remains unclear, with myopathy likely contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. An MRI of the brain and spine showed non-specific abnormalities that do not explain her global deficits.
- The patient has abdominal ileus, with ongoing distension and small amounts of stool. She is receiving lactulose and naloxone through the OG tube, as well as erythromycin as needed.
- She has acute on chronic renal failure, likely due to graft damage from thrombotic microangiopathy. Immune suppression against rejection is being continued, and dialysis will be done on Saturday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
- The patient has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength; we will titrate down
   further; going to 10 mg daily starting in the AM.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia. No
   culture data yet.
   - Treating with vancomycin and meropenem and cipro.
   - Follow cultures closely to try to peel off antibiotics
   - Follow CXRs; stable to slightly improved today
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach today. As prior we believe that risk of reintubation is
   considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to wean
   from the vent. NIFs -17 x2 suggesting poor inspiratory strength.
   Deferred for infection x 2 days, but likely to be able to go to OR
   today. Appreciate thoracics involvement in this patient
s care.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - although metabolic changes do not seem to make major differences in
   mental status, a more sustained trial of daily dialysis might resolve
   hyponatremia over a more sustained period, would be helpful to know if
   this improved mental status
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Stooling not recorded. Continuing nalaxone,
   lactulose. No tube feeds this AM for OR.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, plasminogen activator inhibitor deficiency), and renal failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period and is currently being treated for ventilator-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has pulmonary hemorrhage, which has been stabilized without evidence of new bleeding. She is expected to undergo a tracheostomy today due to the high risk of reintubation and inability to wean from the ventilator.

The patient's mental status remains unclear, and myopathy is likely contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Steroids are being tapered, and efforts are being made to minimize sedation. The patient has abdominal ileus, and her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function but immune suppression against rejection is still being continued.

The patient also has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, PAI inhibition, and ongoing slow hemolytic process. Her hypertension is being managed with captopril and metoprolol, and regular dialysis is being used as the best anti-hypertensive measure. Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, depression/anxiety, and is being considered for daily dialysis as a trial to improve mental status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a complex bleeding/clotting disorder who presented with pulmonary hemorrhage and subsequent respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has experienced multiple medical complications, including altered mental status, hypertensive episodes, renal failure, hyponatremia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The initial presentation of bleeding in the lungs can lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to wean from mechanical ventilation indicates ongoing respiratory failure, which may be due to underlying lung injury or other complications.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of mortality.
4. Hypertensive episodes: The patient has experienced episodes of hypertension, which can potentially lead to end-organ damage if not controlled.
5. Renal failure: The elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen suggest acute kidney injury or renal failure, which can be caused by various factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.
6. Hyponatremia: The persistent hyponatremia indicates a disturbance in sodium"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. We have decreased steroid dosing
   with the hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   Sputum showing GNRs without speciation yet
   - Treating with vancomycin, cipro Meropenem; pulling off vanco today
   - Continuing to follow cultures
   - Follow CXRs; stable to slightly improved today
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach today. As prior we believe that risk of reintubation is
   considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to wean
   from the vent. Repeated NIFs are <20 suggesting poor inspiratory
   strength. Deferred for infection x 2 days, but likely to be able to go
   to OR today. Appreciate thoracics involvement in this patient
s care.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - reduced steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups; should be able to reduce
   sedation with trach
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - although metabolic changes do not seem to make major differences in
   mental status, a more sustained trial of daily dialysis might resolve
   hyponatremia over a more sustained period if mental status does not
   improve with trach and wake-ups
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Continuing nalaxone, lactulose. No tube feeds this AM
   for OR.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - dialysis regularly appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI def.), and renal failure.
- She failed extubation due to weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Steroid dosing has been decreased in hopes of improving strength.
- The patient has developed ventilator-acquired pneumonia after 14+ days on the vent, with consolidation seen on the left lower lobe. She is being treated with vancomycin, cipro, and meropenem.
- There is no current evidence of new pulmonary hemorrhage or bleeding.
- Tracheostomy is planned today as the patient is likely to be unable to wean from the ventilator.
- The patient's mental status remains unclear, with myopathy likely contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. An MRI brain and spine showed non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
- The patient has abdominal ileus, for which lactulose and naloxone are being administered through the OG tube. No tube feeds are given today for the upcoming surgery.
- The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy. Immune suppression against rejection is being continued.
- The patient has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, PAI inhibition, and no significant bleeding today. Her Hct is steadily declining, indicating ongoing hemolysis.
- The patient's hypertension"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. RSBI . We have decreased steroid
   dosing with the hopes of improving strength; we will titrate down
   further; going to 10 mg daily starting in the AM.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia. No
   culture data yet.
   - Treating with vancomycin and meropenem and cipro.
   - Follow cultures closely to try to peel off antibiotics
   - Follow CXRs; stable to slightly improved today
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach today. As prior we believe that risk of reintubation is
   considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to wean
   from the vent. NIFs -17 x2 suggesting poor inspiratory strength.
   Deferred for infection x 2 days, but likely to be able to go to OR
   today. Appreciate thoracics involvement in this patient
s care.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - tapering steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - although metabolic changes do not seem to make major differences in
   mental status, a more sustained trial of daily dialysis might resolve
   hyponatremia over a more sustained period, would be helpful to know if
   this improved mental status
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Stooling not recorded. Continuing nalaxone,
   lactulose. No tube feeds this AM for OR.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   - VBG and lytes after rounds
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - dialysis regularly appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. Consider daily dialysis as above as trial to
   improve mental status.
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, plasminogen activator inhibitor deficiency), and renal failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period and is unable to wean off the ventilator due to weakness, likely caused by steroid myopathy. The patient also has pulmonary hemorrhage, suspected ventilator-acquired pneumonia, and altered mental status, which may be contributing to her muscular weakness and dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator increases the risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of pulmonary hemorrhage, which can lead to respiratory distress and further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged ventilation time, she is at an increased risk of developing VAP, which can worsen her respiratory status and potentially lead to sepsis.
4. Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA): The patient has a diagnosis of TMA, which is a condition characterized by small blood clots forming in the blood vessels. This can result in organ damage, including renal failure.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal failure may progress to AKI,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), complicated coagulopathy, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant. She was admitted to the MICU with renal failure, hemolysis, and respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Currently, the patient requires persistent ventilatory support and has developed critical illness myopathy.

The patient has several allergies, including penicillins, morphine, and metoclopramide, among others. She has received various antibiotics, such as vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem. The patient is currently on propofol infusion and other ICU medications.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/53 to 145/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight has decreased from 50 kg at admission to 45.1 kg currently. Her fluid balance shows an input of 1,348 mL and output of 3,545 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,197 mL.

She requires respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. Her tidal volume ("

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), complicated by coagulopathy and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant. She was admitted to the MICU with renal failure, hemolysis, and respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Currently, she requires persistent ventilatory support and is diagnosed with critical illness myopathy. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, morphine, and certain medications causing dystonia and Parkinsonism. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 116/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on propofol infusion and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory failure. Her flow sheet data shows fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab values. The lab results indicate elevated levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes, with decreased levels of hemoglobin, platelet count, and potassium. The assessment and plan include persistent respiratory failure with myopathy, and the patient is planned for tracheostomy today. She also has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a Gram-negative rod growing in the sputum culture, and vancomycin"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), complicated by coagulopathy and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant. She was admitted to the MICU with renal failure, hemolysis, and respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Currently, she requires persistent ventilatory support and has developed critical illness myopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilatory support increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of sputum culture growing Gram-negative rods (GNR) suggests a possible infection.
2. Tracheostomy: The plan is to perform a tracheostomy today. This procedure carries the risk of bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding structures.
3. Renal failure: The patient already has renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function.
4. Hemolysis: The patient's ongoing hemolysis indicates ongoing red blood cell destruction. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Critical illness myopathy: The patient has developed critical illness myopathy, which is a muscle weakness condition associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation. It is important to assess and manage this condition to facilitate weaning off the ventilator.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of SLE complicated by coagulopathy puts"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Trach placed yesterday with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   Sputum showing GNRs without speciation yet. Treating with cipro/[**Last Name (un) 430**].
   Pulled vanco. Following cultures and CXRs.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach in place and doing well. Will allow for sustained spontaneous
   breathing trials with trach mask.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - reduced steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups; should be able to reduce
   sedation with trach
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - start slowly reintroducing her prior psych meds
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Continuing nalaxone, Lactulose. Tube feeds back on.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - dialysis regularly appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone. Restart other psych meds one
   by one to assess impact

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. We have decreased steroid dosing
   with the hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   Sputum showing GNRs without speciation yet
   - Treating with vancomycin, cipro Meropenem; pulling off vanco today
   - Continuing to follow cultures
   - Follow CXRs; stable to slightly improved today
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach today. As prior we believe that risk of reintubation is
   considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to wean
   from the vent. Repeated NIFs are <20 suggesting poor inspiratory
   strength. Deferred for infection x 2 days, but likely to be able to go
   to OR today. Appreciate thoracics involvement in this patient
s care.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - reduced steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups; should be able to reduce
   sedation with trach
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - although metabolic changes do not seem to make major differences in
   mental status, a more sustained trial of daily dialysis might resolve
   hyponatremia over a more sustained period if mental status does not
   improve with trach and wake-ups
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Continuing nalaxone, lactulose. No tube feeds this AM
   for OR.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - dialysis regularly appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficient), and renal failure. She has been intubated due to weakness, likely steroid myopathy, and has developed ventilator-acquired pneumonia after 14 days on the ventilator. She also has pulmonary hemorrhage, mechanical ventilation, altered mental status, abdominal ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, hypertension, hyponatremia, depression/anxiety, and possible HUS/TTP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding or thrombotic events. This could result in internal bleeding, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may progress, leading to further deterioration in kidney function and accumulation of waste products in the body. This could result in metabolic imbalances and electrolyte disturbances.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's ventilator use increases the risk of developing pneumonia. If not properly managed, VAP could progress to sepsis or septic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. We have decreased steroid dosing
   with the hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   Sputum showing GNRs without speciation yet
   - Treating with vancomycin, cipro Meropenem; pulling off vanco today
   - Continuing to follow cultures
   - Follow CXRs; stable to slightly improved today
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach today. As prior we believe that risk of reintubation is
   considerable, and we can not reliably say she would be able to wean
   from the vent. Repeated NIFs are <20 suggesting poor inspiratory
   strength. Deferred for infection x 2 days, but likely to be able to go
   to OR today. Appreciate thoracics involvement in this patient
s care.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - reduced steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups; should be able to reduce
   sedation with trach
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - although metabolic changes do not seem to make major differences in
   mental status, a more sustained trial of daily dialysis might resolve
   hyponatremia over a more sustained period if mental status does not
   improve with trach and wake-ups
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Continuing nalaxone, lactulose. No tube feeds this AM
   for OR.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding today. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   -          continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   -          follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may
   continue apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior
   values; LDH continues to be stable or slightly declining
   -          Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - dialysis regularly appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of her condition and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation due to weakness, likely caused by steroid myopathy. She is currently on mechanical ventilation.

2. Ventilator-Acquired Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia after being on the ventilator for over 14 days. She presents with consolidation in the left lower lobe, and sputum shows GNRs without speciation yet. She is being treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem.

3. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: There is no current evidence of new hemorrhage or bleeding. Heparin has been discontinued.

4. Tracheostomy: The patient underwent tracheostomy today. Due to the risk of reintubation and inability to reliably wean from the ventilator, the decision was made to proceed with tracheostomy.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains unclear. Myopathy contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction may not fully explain her apparent deficit. MRI brain and spine are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities.

6. Abdominal Ileus: The patient has abdominal ileus, and her bowel regimen includes lactulose and naloxone. Tube feeds have been withheld for upcoming surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and a bleeding disorder. She presented with resurgent TMA and acute renal failure, requiring intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a requirement of 3-6 liters of minute ventilation. She underwent a tracheostomy yesterday and is currently receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. The patient's allergies include penicillins, morphine, and certain medications causing dystonia or Parkinsonism. She has been receiving antibiotics, specifically ciprofloxacin and meropenem, for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3Â°C, blood pressure within normal range, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and low platelet count. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and recent antibiotic therapy suggest the possibility of VAP. This condition can lead to worsening lung function and systemic infection.
2. Steroid myopathy: The patient's use of steroids may result in muscle weakness, which can complicate her"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Trach placed yesterday with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   Sputum showing GNRs without speciation yet. Treating with cipro/[**Last Name (un) 430**].
   Pulled vanco. Following cultures and CXRs.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach in place and doing well. Will allow for sustained spontaneous
   breathing trials with trach mask.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - reduced steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups; should be able to reduce
   sedation with trach
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - start slowly reintroducing her prior psych meds
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Continuing nalaxone, Lactulose. Tube feeds back on.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   - Continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   - Follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may continue
   apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior values; LDH
   continues to be stable or slightly declining
   - Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - dialysis regularly appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone. Restart other psych meds one
   by one to assess impact

Tracheostomy was performed yesterday with the expectation of a long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing is planned to improve strength, with the current dose at 10 mg.

The patient also has ventilator-acquired pneumonia, presumed due to Gram-negative bacteria without speciation yet. She is being treated with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin has been pulled. Cultures and chest X-rays are being followed.

The patient's mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely contributes to muscular weakness/dysfunction, but MRI brain and spine show non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits. Ziprasidone has been restarted, steroids have been reduced, and sedation is being minimized with frequent wake-ups. The patient should be able to reduce sedation with tracheostomy.

The patient has abdominal ileus and is receiving naloxone and lactulose. Tube feeds have been resumed. Erythromycin is given as needed for bowel regimen.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with graft damage"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Trach placed yesterday with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   Sputum showing GNRs without speciation yet. Treating with cipro/[**Last Name (un) 430**].
   Pulled vanco. Following cultures and CXRs.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach in place and doing well. Will allow for sustained spontaneous
   breathing trials with trach mask.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - reduced steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups; should be able to reduce
   sedation with trach
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - start slowly reintroducing her prior psych meds
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Continuing nalaxone, Lactulose. Tube feeds back on.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   - Continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   - Follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may continue
   apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior values; LDH
   continues to be stable or slightly declining
   - Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - dialysis regularly appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone. Restart other psych meds one
   by one to assess impact

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to failed extubation, likely secondary to weakness from steroid myopathy. A tracheostomy was placed yesterday, and the plan is for a long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing is being continued with hopes of improving strength.

The patient has developed ventilator-acquired pneumonia after 14+ days on the ventilator, with consolidation seen on the left lower lobe. She is being treated with ciprofloxacin. Vancomycin was discontinued, and cultures and chest X-rays are being followed.

There is no current evidence of new pulmonary hemorrhage or need for heparin.

The patient's mental status remains unclear, with myopathy likely contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. An MRI of the brain and spine shows non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits. Ziprasidone has been restarted, and steroids have been reduced. Frequent wake-ups are being minimized, and sedation is being reduced with the tracheostomy in place.

The patient also has abdominal ileus and is receiving lactulose and naloxone through the orogastric tube. Tube feeds have been restarted, and erythromycin is being given as needed.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with graft damage due"

   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - reduced steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups; should be able to reduce
   sedation with trach
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - start slowly reintroducing her prior psych meds
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Continuing nalaxone, Lactulose. Tube feeds back on.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   - Continue steroid tx at reduced dose (10 mg currently)
   - Follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may continue
   apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior values; LDH
   continues to be stable or slightly declining
   - Hct, transfuse <25
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - cont metoprolol and captopril
   - continue hydral 10 mg IV prn
   - nitro drip if uncontrolled with standing and bolus meds
   - dialysis regularly appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   - goal BP <160
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Restarted ziprasidone. Restart other psych meds one

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The key points and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has failed extubation due to weakness, likely steroid myopathy. She has a tracheostomy in place and will require a long weaning course from mechanical ventilation.

2. Ventilator-Acquired Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia after 14+ days on mechanical ventilation. This is suspected to be ventilator-acquired pneumonia, and she is being treated with ciprofloxacin.

3. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: Although there is no current evidence of new hemorrhage, the patient's history of pulmonary hemorrhage needs to be closely monitored.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains unclear, and myopathy likely contributes to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Further evaluation, such as an MRI of the brain and spine, is needed to determine the cause.

5. Abdominal Ileus: The patient has abdominal ileus, and measures are being taken to manage this condition, including the use of lactulose and naloxone.

6. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but immune suppression against rejection will continue.

7. Thrombotic Disorder with Hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Trach placed yesterday with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: after 14+ days on vent, LLL
   consolidation after fever. Presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
   Sputum showing pan-sensitive Serratia. Following cultures and CXRs. On
   ciprofloxacin
 will discontinue meropenem today.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION
   Trach in place and doing well. Will allow for sustained spontaneous
   breathing trials with trach mask.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mental status remains unclear. Myopathy likely
   contributing to muscular weakness/dysfunction. Myopathy alone may not
   be able to explain all of her apparent deficit, but MRI brain and spine
   are essentially unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem
   unlikely to explain the global nature of her deficits.
   - restarted ziprasidone
   - reduced steroids as above
   - minimize sedation, frequent wake-ups; should be able to reduce
   sedation with trach
   - consider bolus pain treatment rather than ongoing sedation if patient
   appears uncomfortable
   - start slowly reintroducing her prior psych meds
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Continuing nalaxone, Lactulose. Tube feeds back on.
   - instill lactulose, naloxone in OG tube
   - iv erythromycin as needed
   -cont  bowel regimen
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue steroids for renal and heme purposes; continuing renal dose
   as above
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Tracheostomy placed [**1-21**] with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: Has ventilator-acquired pneumonia with
   sputum [**1-19**] showing pan-sensitive Serratia. Following cultures and
   CXRs. On ciprofloxacin
 will discontinue meropenem today given culture
   sensitivities.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION: Trach in place and doing well. Will allow for
   sustained spontaneous breathing trials with trach mask.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/PSYCHIATRIC: MRI brain and spine are essentially
   unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to
   explain the global nature of her deficits.  She is on a number of
   psychiatric medications as an outpatient.  She was increasingly
   agitated overnight and placed on midazolam gtt.
   - Restarted ziprasidone [**1-17**]
 will titrate up today
   - Restarted restarted remeron and wellbutrin overnight
 will titrate
   up remeron today
   - Will give ativan 1 mg Q8H and titrate up as needed
   - Discontinue midazolam gtt now
   - Reduced steroids as above
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   - Continue steroids at reduced dose
 prednisone 10 mg daily
   indefinitely
   - Follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may continue
   apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior values; LDH
   continues to be stable or slightly declining
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse <25
   - Will not restart heparin gtt at this time given bleeding around
   tracheostomy site
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - Appreciate renal input
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone
   - Continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Continue hydral 10 mg IV prn for SBP > 160
   - Regular HD appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of complicated coagulopathy, who is currently in the ICU for renal failure and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has developed a tracheostomy. The patient's coagulopathy appears to be stabilizing, but she is still experiencing oozing from the tracheostomy site. Her anxiety has been significant overnight. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but abnormal kidney function with increased creatinine levels. She also has an elevated lactate level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's sputum culture revealed pan-sensitive Serratia, indicating a possible infection. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
2. Bleeding: Despite the stabilization of coagulopathy, the patient continues to ooze from the tracheostomy site. This suggests an ongoing bleeding risk, which may require careful management to prevent further hemorrhage.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate ongoing renal dysfunction. This could lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased risk of infection.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory parameters is necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of complicated coagulopathy. She has been admitted to the hospital for renal failure and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to her respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include significant anxiety overnight, for which she has been started on a Versed drip. She has a history of allergies to penicillins and morphine, resulting in rashes. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin and meropenem.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 86/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,422 mL and output of 3,900 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,478 mL. She is receiving oxygen through a tracheostomy mask and endotracheal tube, and is on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume of 380 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 32 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O. Her fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 50%.

The patient's blood work reveals a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 23 mg/dL, sodium of 134 mEq/L, potassium of 3.1 mEq/L, and glucose levels ranging from 76 to 112 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prothrombin time (PT) of 14.2 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 33.7 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte count.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, agitation, and coagulopathy. She has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient is also receiving dialysis and has been weaned off sedation. Further plans are discussed in the resident note."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Tracheostomy placed [**1-21**] with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now. Now on trach
   mask alone, doing well.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: Has ventilator-acquired pneumonia with
   sputum [**1-19**] showing pan-sensitive Serratia. Following cultures and
   CXRs. On ciprofloxacin
 discontinued meropenem given culture
   sensitivities.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION: Trach in place and doing well. Continue to
   encourage spontaneous breathing with trach mask as tolerated.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/PSYCHIATRIC: MRI brain and spine are essentially
   unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to
   explain the global nature of her deficits.  She has been on a number of
   psychiatric medications as an outpatient.
   - Restarted ziprasidone [**1-17**]
 will titrate up today
   - Restarted remeron and wellbutrin, titrated up remeron
   - Will give ativan 1 mg Q8H and titrate up as needed
   - Reduced steroids as above
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   - Continue steroids at reduced dose
 prednisone 10 mg daily
   indefinitely
   - Follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may continue
   apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior values; LDH
   continues to be stable or slightly declining
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse <25
   - Will not restart heparin gtt at this time given bleeding around
   tracheostomy site
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - Appreciate renal input
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone
   - Continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril. Had low pressure overnight after prn hydral; consider
   other PRN meds for hypertension now.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Stop hydral PRN and consider additional captopril prn
   - Regular HD appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   HYPONATREMIA
   Improved; 135 today pre-dialysis. Follow.
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Resolved.
   -Continue bowel regimen

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Tracheostomy placed [**1-21**] with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: Has ventilator-acquired pneumonia with
   sputum [**1-19**] showing pan-sensitive Serratia. Following cultures and
   CXRs. On ciprofloxacin
 will discontinue meropenem today given culture
   sensitivities.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION: Trach in place and doing well. Will allow for
   sustained spontaneous breathing trials with trach mask.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/PSYCHIATRIC: MRI brain and spine are essentially
   unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to
   explain the global nature of her deficits.  She is on a number of
   psychiatric medications as an outpatient.  She was increasingly
   agitated overnight and placed on midazolam gtt.
   - Restarted ziprasidone [**1-17**]
 will titrate up today
   - Restarted restarted remeron and wellbutrin overnight
 will titrate
   up remeron today
   - Will give ativan 1 mg Q8H and titrate up as needed
   - Discontinue midazolam gtt now
   - Reduced steroids as above
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   - Continue steroids at reduced dose
 prednisone 10 mg daily
   indefinitely
   - Follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may continue
   apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior values; LDH
   continues to be stable or slightly declining
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse <25
   - Will not restart heparin gtt at this time given bleeding around
   tracheostomy site
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - Appreciate renal input
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone
   - Continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Continue hydral 10 mg IV prn for SBP > 160
   - Regular HD appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   HYPONATREMIA
   Returns on non-HD days. In longer run could consider daily dialysis
   trial to see if improves mental status; no urgent need to do this yet.
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Resolved.
   -Continue  bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is a complex bleeding disorder leading to pulmonary hemorrhage and respiratory failure, resulting in the inability to wean from mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's 24-hour events include discontinuing meropenem, titrating up geodon, remeron, and adding ativan PRN. There was also a significant drop in systolic blood pressure from 170s to 80s after administering PRN hydralazine, followed by a response to 500cc normal saline. 

The patient's allergies include keflex, penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, compazine, and reglan. 

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F)
- Heart rate: 100 bpm (normal range: 78-117 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 144/50 mmHg (normal range: 82-113/50-83 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute (normal range: 11-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on tracheostomy mask with CPAP/PSV ventilation

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 3.1-10.7 thousand/mm3

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a complicated hospital course, including a diagnosis of SLE, TMA, anti-phospholipid Ab syndrome, and ESRD. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy and non-invasive ventilation for 24 hours. The patient is also competing with ciprofloxacin for serratia VAP and is on hemodialysis for ESRD. Her steroid/ICU myopathy has been tapered to 10mg prednisone. The plan is to discharge her to rehab after weaning off the ventilator. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. It is crucial to monitor her respiratory status closely and maintain strict infection control measures.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as the use of compression stockings should be continued to prevent DVT.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, resulting in a positive fluid balance. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or cardiac complications.
4. Renal function deterioration: The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESR"

   Assessment and Plan
   I reviewed the relevant history, saw and examined the patient, and was
   physically present with the ICU team for the key portions of the
   services provided. I would emphasize and add the following points:
   54 with complex bleeding diathesis, SLE, TMA, ESRD s/p renal
   transplant, APLA syndrome, admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and hemolysis. Had failure to wean with serratia VAP. Trached on [**1-21**].
   Past 24 hours has tolerated trach mask. Exam notable for eyes open,
   alert variably following commands, lungs clear at bases bilaterally.
   Dialysis catheter site appears erythematous.
   Completing course of cipro from serratia VAP. On HD for ESRD.
   Significant steroid/ICU myopathy now tapered to 10mg prednisone.
   Agree with plan of transferring to a LTAC. Further plans as per
   resident note. Patient is critically ill.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a complicated hospital course, including dyspnea, renal failure, and multiple medical conditions such as bleeding diathesis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-renal transplant, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA), and hypoxemic respiratory failure with hemolysis. She has been admitted multiple times and has experienced various complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Serratia species.

The patient is currently in the ICU, where she has been receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube since January 21st. She has tolerated the tracheostomy mask well and shows signs of alertness, although her ability to follow commands is variable. Her lungs are clear at the bases bilaterally. There is erythema around the dialysis catheter site. She is receiving ciprofloxacin for serratia VAP and undergoing hemodialysis for ESRD.

The patient has also been treated with significant doses of steroids and is now on a tapering regimen of 10 mg/day of prednisone due to ICU myopathy. It is noted that the patient is critically ill and plans for her further care involve transferring her to a long-term acute care facility."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Tracheostomy placed [**1-21**] with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now. Now on trach
   mask alone, doing well.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: Has ventilator-acquired pneumonia with
   sputum [**1-19**] showing pan-sensitive Serratia. Following cultures and
   CXRs. On ciprofloxacin 7 day course
 discontinued meropenem given
   culture sensitivities.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION: Trach in place and doing well. Continue to
   encourage spontaneous breathing with trach mask as tolerated.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/PSYCHIATRIC: MRI brain and spine are essentially
   unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to
   explain the global nature of her deficits.  She has been on a number of
   psychiatric medications as an outpatient.
   - Restarted ziprasidone [**1-17**]
 will titrate up today
   - Restarted remeron and wellbutrin, titrated up remeron
   - Will give ativan 1 mg Q8H and titrate up as needed
   - Reduced steroids as above
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   - Continue steroids at reduced dose
 prednisone 10 mg daily
   indefinitely
   - Follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may continue
   apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior values; LDH
   continues to be stable or slightly declining
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse <25
   - Will not restart heparin gtt at this time given bleeding around
   tracheostomy site
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - Appreciate renal input
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone
   - Continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril. Had low pressure overnight after prn hydral; consider
   other PRN meds for hypertension now.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Stop hydral PRN and consider additional captopril prn
   - Regular HD appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   HYPONATREMIA
   Improved
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Resolved.
   -Continue bowel regimen

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. She has respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement due to failed extubation, likely caused by weakness, possibly related to steroid myopathy. She is currently on tracheostomy mask ventilation and doing well.

The patient also has ventilator-acquired pneumonia, which is being treated with ciprofloxacin. Heparin has been discontinued due to the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient's altered mental status and psychiatric history are being managed with psychiatric medications, including ziprasidone, remeron, wellbutrin, and ativan.

The patient has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia, PAI inhibition, and ongoing slow hemolytic process. Steroids are being continued at a reduced dose to manage this condition. Regular hemodialysis is being performed on a Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule. The patient also has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol and captopril.

Other conditions that have been addressed include acute on chronic renal failure, abdominal ileus, and hypokalemia. The patient's nutritional support involves receiving Nutren Renal (Full) at a rate of 25 mL/hour.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection from the tracheostomy"

","Summary:
The patient is a tracheostomized individual in the ICU with a history of allergies to penicillins, dicloxacillin, morphine, Compazine, Reglan, and an unknown reaction to ciprofloxacin. The patient has been on tube feeds for nutritional support. On the current date, the patient presented with some erythema around the HD catheter and a high temperature of 100.9 degrees Celsius. Cultures were taken from the PICC and HD line. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for isolated high temperature.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of erythema around the HD catheter and high fever indicates a potential infection. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent the progression of the infection.

2. Allergic Reaction: Considering the patient's known allergies, there is a risk of an allergic reaction to any medications or substances they may be exposed to. Close monitoring and avoidance of known allergens are essential.

3. Respiratory Issues: As a tracheostomized patient, the patient relies on respiratory support. Any compromise in oxygenation or ventilation can lead to respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, particularly oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, is crucial.

4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates a negative total fluid balance, which may pose risks for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Appropriate fluid management is necessary to maintain the patient's fluid and"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with respiratory failure, coagulopathy (TMA, PAI
   def.), and renal failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Failed extubation [**1-13**] most likely due to
   weakness, likely steroid myopathy. Tracheostomy placed [**1-21**] with
   expectation of long weaning course. Decreased steroid dosing with the
   hopes of improving strength, continuing at 10 mg for now. Now on trach
   mask alone, doing well.
   * VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: Has ventilator-acquired pneumonia with
   sputum [**1-19**] showing pan-sensitive Serratia. Following cultures and
   CXRs. On ciprofloxacin
 discontinued meropenem given culture
   sensitivities.
   * PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE: No current evidence of new hemorrhage or [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Heparin still off.
   * MECHANICAL VENTILATION: Trach in place and doing well. Continue to
   encourage spontaneous breathing with trach mask as tolerated.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/PSYCHIATRIC: MRI brain and spine are essentially
   unrevealing with non-specific abnormalities that seem unlikely to
   explain the global nature of her deficits.  She has been on a number of
   psychiatric medications as an outpatient.
   - Restarted ziprasidone [**1-17**]
 will titrate up today
   - Restarted remeron and wellbutrin, titrated up remeron
   - Will give ativan 1 mg Q8H and titrate up as needed
   - Reduced steroids as above
   THROMBOTIC DISORDER WITH HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, PAI inhibition. No
   significant bleeding recently. Steadily declining Hct c/w ongoing slow
   hemolytic process.
   - Continue steroids at reduced dose
 prednisone 10 mg daily
   indefinitely
   - Follow LDH and smears; appreciate heme/onc note that TMA may continue
   apace even with relatively moderate LDH compared to prior values; LDH
   continues to be stable or slightly declining
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse <25
   - Will not restart heparin gtt at this time given bleeding around
   tracheostomy site
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
   Graft damage due to thrombotic microangiopathy; no donor antibodies.
   Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function, but still
   continuing immune suppression against rejection for now
   - Appreciate renal input
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone
   - Continue with HD on Sat/Tues/Thurs schedule
   HYPERTENSION. Hypertensive at baseline, especially when having active
   thrombotic microangiopathy.  Also has h/o hypertensive crisis and
   seizures in the context of extreme hypertension.  BP improved control
   on captopril. Had low pressure overnight after prn hydral; consider
   other PRN meds for hypertension now.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Stop hydral PRN and consider additional captopril prn
   - Regular HD appears to be best anti-hypertensive measure
   HYPONATREMIA
   Improved; 135 today pre-dialysis. Follow.
   ABDOMINAL ILEUS:  Resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure, coagulopathy (thrombotic microangiopathy, PAI deficiency), and renal failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to failed extubation likely secondary to weakness, possibly steroid myopathy. A tracheostomy was placed on 01/21. Her recent labs show stable renal function, normal white blood cell count, and normal platelet count. She has been diagnosed with ventilator-acquired pneumonia caused by pan-sensitive Serratia, for which she is receiving ciprofloxacin. No evidence of new pulmonary hemorrhage or thrombotic microangiopathy has been found. Her mental status is global and non-specific abnormalities on MRI brain and spine do not explain her deficits. She has been restarted on psychiatric medications and her steroids have been reduced. She has a thrombotic disorder with hemolytic anemia and PAI inhibition, with declining hematocrit consistent with ongoing hemolysis. Her transplanted kidney is likely not to recover function but immune suppression against rejection will continue. She also has hypertension, which has been controlled with captopril, and resolved abdominal ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is unable to maintain adequate spontaneous breathing with the tracheostomy mask or if there is a recurrence of ventilator-acquired pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a long ICU stay for renal failure, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and respiratory failure. She has multiple allergies, including to penicillins and morphine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/67 to 170/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy mask, receiving supplemental oxygen at 40%. Her weight has decreased from 50 kg to 45.1 kg. Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 1,587 mL. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy suggest ongoing respiratory support needs. She may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia or further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Renal failure: The patient's history of renal failure and ongoing dialysis catheter indicate ongoing renal dysfunction. She may be at risk for further deterioration in kidney function or complications related to dialysis.
3. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): TMA is a condition characterized by small blood clots that can lead to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman in the midst of a long ICU stay for renal failure, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and respiratory failure. She has multiple medical allergies and has been on various medications including antibiotics, pain relievers, and medications for gastrointestinal issues.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and 100% oxygen saturation. She is on mechanical ventilation support with a tracheostomy mask and has been on this mode of ventilation for 48 hours.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive total fluid intake of 1,213 mL and a negative fluid balance of 1,587 mL over the past 24 hours. Her weight has decreased from 50 kg at admission to 45.1 kg currently.

The patient's blood tests reveal elevated levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, and leukocyte count, along with low levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Her blood gases show a pH of 7.29, indicating acidosis.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, standby ventilator mode, set tidal volume (Vt) at 97 mL, spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) of 0, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 0 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and movement. The patient responds to verbal commands but movement, tone, and other neurologic functions are not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of AST, ALT, lactate, LDH, and C-reactive protein (CRP), while her albumin level is within normal range.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, renal failure, infection (due to the presence of serratia VAP), and potential bleeding disorders due to thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring and management of these conditions will be necessary for the patient's well-being."
