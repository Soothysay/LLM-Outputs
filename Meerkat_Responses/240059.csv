   54 y/o male with ESRD and DM who presented with abdominal pain and
   found to have acute cholangitis and cholecystitis.  Intubated and ERCP
   performed yesterday with findings c/w cholangitis and stent placed.
   Today, plan for IR for tube drainage of gallbladder and fluid
   collection in abdomen.
   Remains intubated, sedated, with normal hemodynamics.
   Assessment:
   1)       Cholangitis and Cholecystitis
   2)       Respiratory Failure, Acute
   3)       ESRD
   Plan:
                   - To IR intubated for tube drainage of GB and fluid
   collection
                 - Re-evaluate when returns for potential extubation

   on:[**2106-7-30**] 12:50 AM ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with abdominal pain and was found to have acute cholangitis and cholecystitis. The patient was intubated and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) yesterday, which showed a marked diffuse dilation of the main duct with a CBD measuring 15mm and two to three round stones ranging in size from 6mm to 8mm at the lower third of the common bile duct. An 8cm by 10FR biliary stent was placed successfully using an Oasis stent introducer kit, and purulent bile extruded from the biliary stent after placement. Two sessile polyps of benign appearance and ranging in size from 8mm to 10mm were found in the stomach body.

The patient's current assessment includes sepsis, specifically cholangitis/cholecystitis versus possible aspiration versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Blood cultures are positive for Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The plan is to continue vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole, perform an interventional radiology (IR) guided percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) today, follow up surgical recommendations, and check urine"

   # Sepsis: likely from cholangitis vs fluid collection:
   Currently vital signs are stable and fevers resolved after vanc and
   ceftazidime.  Prior episodes of hypotension were responsive to fluid
   boluses; not requiring pressors.  Sources of sepsis include cholangitis
   given obstructive pattern of LFTs, recurrent cholecystitis, or infected
   fluid collection as result of previous cholecystitis and drain
   placement.  Pt also has a LUL infiltrate on CXR, ?aspiration v HCAP.
   Had positive blood cxs are OSH positive for GNRs.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/metronidazole
   - follow up OSH bcxs, bcxs here
   - check U/A, urine culture if makes urine
   - IVF boluses prn, follow O2 sats, give with caution due to renal
   failure
   - Hold home metoprolol
   - continue Vanc to cover hospital acquired infection; would favor zosyn
   for coverage of cholangitis and GNR bacteremia, but unable to confirm
   nature of his reaction to amoxicillin and he did defervesce with
   ceftazidime, so will continue that for present
   - add flagyl for better coverage of GI bugs
   - ERCP today, ERCP following, appreciate recs

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presented with likely cholangitis in the setting of recent percutaneous tube for cholecystitis. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, and fevers have resolved after receiving vancomycin and ceftazidime. Prior episodes of hypotension were responsive to fluid boluses, without the need for pressors. Sources of sepsis include cholangitis, recurrent cholecystitis, or an infected fluid collection as a result of previous cholecystitis and drain placement. The patient also has a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which may be due to aspiration versus hospital-acquired pneumonia. Blood cultures are positive for gram-negative rods.

Plan:
1. Continue vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.
2. Follow up on blood cultures and obtain urine culture if feasible.
3. Provide IV fluid boluses as needed, closely monitoring oxygen saturation due to renal failure.
4. Hold metoprolol.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2 and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He was admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to suspected cholangitis/cholecystitis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/56 to 136/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received multiple interventions including placement of a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) for drainage, IR-guided PTC, and ERCP. He also has an 8cm by 10FR biliary stent placed successfully using an Oasis stent introducer kit. Purulent bile extruded from the biliary stent after placement.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, total bilirubin, and liver enzymes. The patient has positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: Continue vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole. IR-guided PTC today. Follow-up surgical recommendations. Check urine analysis and culture if possible. Hold home metoprolol.
2. ESRD on HD: Hemodialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Continue Aranesp, Nephrocaps, and Phoslo.
3. Abdominal wound infection: On vancomycin. Wound care consult.
4. DM2: Currently diet-controlled. Follow-up with fasting blood sugar (FBS) and HbA1c (ISS).
5. HTN: Hold home metoprolol for now.
6. Episodes of apnea: Hold off on narcotics. Consider CPAP at night.
7. Depression/anxiety: Continue citalopram.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis indicated by positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods and purulent bile extruded from the biliary stent. Continuing appropriate antibiotic therapy and further interventions may be necessary to control the infection.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney injury. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting treatment accordingly is essential.
3. Liver dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes and bilir"

   Currently vital signs are stable and fevers resolved after vanc and
   ceftazidime.  Prior episodes of hypotension were responsive to fluid
   boluses; not requiring pressors.  Sources of sepsis include cholangitis
   given obstructive pattern of LFTs, recurrent cholecystitis, or infected
   fluid collection as result of previous cholecystitis and drain
   placement.  Pt also has a LUL infiltrate on CXR, ?aspiration v HCAP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presenting with likely cholangitis in the setting of recent percutaneous tube for cholecystitis. He has a history of MRSA abdominal wound infection, DM2, HTN, episodes of apnea, and depression/anxiety. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, and fevers have resolved after receiving vancomycin and ceftazidime. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's fluid status and electrolytes are reasonably good. He is due for hemodialysis today or tomorrow, depending on further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis, likely from cholangitis vs fluid collection: The patient may develop sepsis due to cholangitis or an infected fluid collection resulting from previous cholecystitis and drain placement. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment are necessary.
2. Hospital-acquired infection: As the patient has a positive blood culture for gram-negative rods and a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, there is a possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Further evaluation and appropriate antibiotic coverage are needed.
3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. Monitoring his renal function and adjusting medications accordingly are essential.
4. Abdominal wound infection: Although the patient's wound appears"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for sepsis and intubated in the setting of an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), a heart rate of 75 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 109/46 mmHg to 118/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's weight is 97.4 kg, and his height is 69 inches.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics such as vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole, as well as other medications like pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and various ICU medications. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes, with normal hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolyte levels, and albumin.

Assessment and plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient has cholangitis/cholecystitis vs. aspiration vs. healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). He is on the appropriate antibiotics for GNRs (gram-negative rods). Continue vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole. Follow up surgical recommendations, follow-up blood cultures, check urine analysis and culture if the patient is able to produce urine, and hold home metoprolol.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. He should continue with Aranesp, Nephrocaps, and Phoslo. Vancomycin and ceftazidime should be given per HD protocol.
3. Abdominal wound infection: The patient has a history of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) abdominal wound infection. He should continue on vancomycin, and a wound care consult should be followed up.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient is currently diet-controlled. He should continue with his current diabetes medications, such as FS (possibly referring to a specific medication) and ISS (possibly referring to a specific medication).
5. Hypertension: The patient's home medication for hypertension, metoprolol,"
