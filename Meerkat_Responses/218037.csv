   2) Hypotension - resolved after volume resuscitation, required
   transient levophed - no off
                             - possible blood loss with hct drop which has
   stabilized after 1 unit PRBC, no evidence of ongoing bleeding
                            - following serial Hct with goal of 25-28 per
   surgery
   3) Diastolic CHF - CXR appeared wet after OR but she is sating 100% on
   2 liters and now has very clear lungs on exam.
   4) Oliguria - pre-renal vs ATN (creat stable, however). Should also
   exclude obstructive uropathy with renal ultrasound. Urine electrolytes
   pending.
                      She is on lasix at home - will attempt to increase
   urine output with lasix challenge and consider fluid bolus if she
   doesn't respond
   5) Ancef/Flagyl for post-op prophylaxis
   6) Afib/flutter - holding amio/coumadin/lovenox until we are certain
   Hct is stable. Paced.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), small cell cancer of the lung status post resection, diverticulitis with perforation followed by colostomy, and diastolic dysfunction. She was admitted for an elective takedown of colostomy and ventral hernia repair, but experienced prolonged anesthesia with intraoperative hypotension and poor urine output during a 6-hour procedure. She received 3 liters of normal saline (LR) and was started on Neo, which was successfully weaned in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Additional 4 liters of LR were bolused to maintain blood pressure, but her urine output remained poor. She was sent to the ICU for ongoing care and monitoring due to her multiple medical problems.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Colostomy takedown/hernia repair: Management will be determined by the surgical team.
2. Hypotension: Resolved after volume resuscitation and required transient use of levophed. Possible causes include blood loss with a drop in hematocrit (Hct), which has stabilized after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Serial Hct measurements will be followed with a goal of 25-28% during surgery.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's chest X-ray showed volume overload"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year-old female with a history of a.fib on coumadin, perforated
   diverticulum s/p sigmoid Hartmann in [**4-21**], diastolic heart failure who
   presented for colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair complicated
   by hypotension and low UOP postoperatively.
   # Hypotension: The patient was noted to have SBPs of 70's in the OR and
   postoperatively and was supported with neo for a short while.   This
   was weaned off prior to her admission, however her SBPs ran in the high
   80
s to low 100
s overnight, most recently in the low 100s. Her
   outpatient records show that her normal SBP ranges in the 90's to
   100's.  Given concern for a Hct drop postoperatively ( from 37.3 to 26
   and INR of 1.8), she was given 1 unit of FFP, 1 unit of PRBC, and Vit K
   overnight.  Her Hct had an appropriate rise to the blood and has
   remained stable around 30.  She received a total of > 9 L of fluid
   yesterday and continues to sat well on 2 L NC.  She has remained
   afebrile; her UA did show 14 WBC, few back, and [**Last Name (un) **] leuk.  Another
   cause for her lowish BP could have been the dilaudid PCA which was
   being given for pain control.
   - Will check [**Hospital1 **] Hct and monitor JP output.
   - F/u UCx, BCx.
   # S/p colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair:
   - F/u surgery recs.
   - NPO for now.
   - Ostomy and surgical wound care.
   - Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
   - Cefazolin and flagyl per surgery for postop antibiotic ppx.
   # Oligura: The patient had only made 192 cc of urine in 10 hours intra
   and postoperatively.  She was given 3 L LR during the case and another
   4 L in the PACU.  Cr was 1.4 postoperatively which is within her most
   recent baseline.  Her oliguria may represent ATN given her hypotension
   in the OR.  This am her Cr is stable at 1.5, however her UOP remains
   low with only 34 cc in 6 hours.  She was given a trial of 40 mg IV
   lasix last night without response.  Her FENA is 0.1, however she was on
   lasix as an outpatient making this unreliable.  Her FEUrea is 16.89 %
   which is also consistent with prerenal ARF.
   - Will obtain a renal US this am to rule out postrenal causes such as
   obstruction from her recent surgery as well as obtain dopplers to check
   blood flow to the kidney.
   - Most likely her oligura represents ATN secondary to hypotension in
   the OR.  She has been unresponsive to IVF making prerenal ARF unlikely
   even though her urine electorlytes support a prerenal etiology.
   - Will try another 40 mg IV lasix.
   - Monitor urine output closely.
   # Atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement for tachy-brady
   syndrome:  Patient is currently atrially paced.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q6h while NPO, restart po metoprolol once taking
   POs.
   - Restart amiodarone and coumadin once able to take POs.
   - Holding on the lovenox bridge for now given concern for bleeding; d/w
   surgery when to restart
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient with an EF of >55%, but with
   diastolic heart failure.  No sign of volume overload, as above is
   likely volume deplete.
   - Patient was given a trial of 40 mg of IV lasix as above.
   # Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine 25 mcg IV daily while NPO.  Restart her
   home synthroid dose when taking POs.
   # COPD/OSA: Patient has a history of COPD, but is not on medications as
   an outpatient.  Also has a history of OSA, but refuses to wear CPAP.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVF as above; replete electrolytes prn

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year-old female with a history of a.fib on coumadin, perforated
   diverticulum s/p sigmoid Hartmann in [**4-21**], diastolic heart failure who
   presented for colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair complicated
   by hypotension and low UOP postoperatively.
   # Hypotension: The patient was noted to have SBPs of 70's in the OR and
   postoperatively and was supported with neo for a short while.   This
   was weaned off prior to her admission, however her SBPs ran in the high
   80
s to low 100
s overnight, most recently in the low 100s. Her
   outpatient records show that her normal SBP ranges in the 90's to
   100's.  Given concern for a Hct drop postoperatively ( from 37.3 to 26
   and INR of 1.8), she was given 1 unit of FFP, 1 unit of PRBC, and Vit K
   overnight.  Her Hct had an appropriate rise to the blood and has
   remained stable around 30.  She received a total of > 9 L of fluid
   yesterday and continues to sat well on 2 L NC.  She has remained
   afebrile; her UA did show 14 WBC, few back, and [**Last Name (un) **] leuk.  Another
   cause for her lowish BP could have been the dilaudid PCA which was
   being given for pain control.
   - Will check [**Hospital1 **] Hct and monitor JP output.
   - F/u UCx, BCx.
   # S/p colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair:
   - F/u surgery recs.
   - NPO for now.
   - Ostomy and surgical wound care.
   - Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
   - Cefazolin and flagyl per surgery for postop antibiotic ppx.
   # Oligura: The patient had only made 192 cc of urine in 10 hours intra
   and postoperatively.  She was given 3 L LR during the case and another
   4 L in the PACU.  Cr was 1.4 postoperatively which is within her most
   recent baseline.  Her oliguria may represent ATN given her hypotension
   in the OR.  This am her Cr is stable at 1.5, however her UOP remains
   low with only 34 cc in 6 hours.  She was given a trial of 40 mg IV
   lasix last night without response.  Her FENA is 0.1, however she was on
   lasix as an outpatient making this unreliable.  Her FEUrea is 16.89 %
   which is also consistent with prerenal ARF.
   - Will obtain a renal US this am to rule out postrenal causes such as
   obstruction from her recent surgery as well as obtain dopplers to check
   blood flow to the kidney.
   - Most likely her oligura represents ATN secondary to hypotension in
   the OR.  She has been unresponsive to IVF making prerenal ARF unlikely
   even though her urine electorlytes support a prerenal etiology.
   - Will try another 40 mg IV lasix.
   - Monitor urine output closely.
   # Atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement for tachy-brady
   syndrome:  Patient is currently atrially paced.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q6h while NPO, restart po metoprolol once taking
   POs.
   - Restart amiodarone and coumadin once able to take POs.
   - Holding on the lovenox bridge for now given concern for bleeding; d/w
   surgery when to restart
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient with an EF of >55%, but with
   diastolic heart failure.  No sign of volume overload, as above is
   likely volume deplete.
   - Patient was given a trial of 40 mg of IV lasix as above, wil given
   another trial this am as above.
   # Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine 25 mcg IV daily while NPO.  Restart her
   home synthroid dose when taking POs.
   # COPD/OSA: Patient has a history of COPD, but is not on medications as
   an outpatient.  Also has a history of OSA, but refuses to wear CPAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute renal failure, hypotension, and an elevated blood glucose level. The patient received a transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), packed red blood cells (PRBC), and vitamin K. His hematocrit (Hct) levels improved from 22% to 31.4% after the transfusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate (HR) of 61 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 109/39 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 106. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), lactic acid, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating renal dysfunction. The patient is on furosemide for fluid management and is being monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated levels of BUN, Cr, and lactic acid suggest ongoing renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte"
