","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, esophageal cancer, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type II. She was admitted with hematemesis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient experienced a significant drop in blood pressure and heart rate overnight and was intubated for airway protection. She received 4 liters of intravenous fluids and 3 packed red blood cells. Levophed was initiated this morning, and the patient is planned to undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Esophageal source of bleeding: The patient's history of esophageal cancer and current hematemesis suggest that the bleeding may be originating from the esophagus. This could potentially lead to further bleeding or perforation if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which could be due to blood loss. If not treated promptly, it may result in organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Respiratory distress: Intubation was performed for airway protection, but the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored. Any signs of respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation should be addressed immediately.
4. Infection: The patient's prolonged immobilization and invasive procedures increase the risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBS"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, esophageal cancer, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type II. She was admitted with hematemesis and experienced significant bleeding, requiring intubation and blood transfusions. The patient is currently hypotensive and tachycardic. She has a history of stent placement for esophageal cancer and has undergone an EGD procedure. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions that have increased in size despite talc pleurodeisis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing blood loss and hypotension.
2. Respiratory distress due to compromised airway protection and potential aspiration.
3. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, which may be exacerbated by the patient's current condition.
4. Infection risk due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
5. Thromboembolic events like deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
6. Nutritional deficiencies due to NPO status and prolonged ICU stay.
7. Electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing losses and medication administration.
8. Complications related to the patient's underlying malignancies, such as tumor progression or metastasis.
9. Renal dysfunction due to hypoperfusion and potential use of nephrotoxic medications.
10. Psychological distress for the patient and her family due to the severity of the illness and prolonged"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and recently diagnosed esophageal cancer with stent placement. She presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and her condition has progressively worsened overnight with ongoing bleeding and hypotension. She was intubated for airway control due to hematemesis.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's primary concern is UGIB, which may be due to an esophageal source or gastritis. Endoscopic examination (EGD) is planned to localize and intervene on the bleeding site.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, likely due to ongoing blood loss. Aggressive fluid and colloid resuscitation will be continued to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) above 10. Pressors may also be weaned when mean arterial pressure (MAP) is above 60.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for airway control due to hematemesis. It is important to monitor and manage her respiratory status closely, including checking arterial blood gases (ABG).

4. Pleural effusions: The patient appears to have mildly increased pleural effusions compared to previous films. This should be monitored and addressed appropriately.

5. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and recently diagnosed esophageal cancer with stent placement. She presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hematemesis, and hypotension overnight. The patient was intubated for airway control and is currently on low-dose pressor support. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 34.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 80%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the removal of an unplanned line/catheter, placement of a right internal jugular (RIJ) line, and elective intubation. Additional blood transfusions have been given to maintain hemodynamic stability.

The patient's laboratory results show a decreased hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 29.8%. The platelet count is within normal range at 286 K/uL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are also provided.

Imaging studies reveal fibrotic changes in the esophagus and bilateral small effusions, with no significant changes from the previous day. Microbiology blood cultures are pending.

The patient's assessment includes ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding"

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and esophageal cancer who was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and additional stent placement. The source of bleeding was confirmed to be in the esophagus, but intervention was not possible according to the GI team. The patient is at high risk for rebleeding and becoming unstable.

The patient has been receiving IV fluids and blood transfusions due to hypotension secondary to blood loss. She is also on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and NPO (nothing by mouth). Her Hct (hematocrit) levels have been monitored and transfused when below 25 or in case of hemodynamic instability. The goal is to maintain a CVP (central venous pressure) between 10-12 and MAP (mean arterial pressure) above 60.

The patient is intubated for airway protection and there have been increasing pressures on the ventilator, which may indicate bronchospasm or overload. Daily chest X-rays will be performed.

The patient has tachycardia, not responsive to IV fluids, suggesting ongoing blood loss or possible atrial fibrillation. Digoxin has been given for atrial fibrillation and Lopressor has been started to control heart rate. 

Leukocytosis is likely due to a stress response. Bilateral pleural effusions have"

   cancer (requiring esophogeal stent), afib, DMII, s/p EGD with
   additional stent placement adm with hematemesis/UGIB initially HD
   stable with decompensation overnight.
   .
   UGIB
   -          confirmed esophageal source, no intervention possible per
   GI, patient high risk to rebleed and become unstable, her son is coming
   in today from [**Country **] to see his mother and at that point the family
   will discuss her status, currently DNR

   -          IV PPI
   -          NPO
   -          Transfuse HCT<25 or HD unstable with precipitous drop in
   HCT, required 5 units blood yesterday
   .
   Hypotension
   -          secondary to blood loss in setting hematemesis
   -          cx NGTD
   -          transfuse HCT<25 or acute drop
   -          keep MAP >60
   -          off pressors
   -          IVF bolus for UOP<30cc/r and goal CVP 10-12, received 6 L
   yesterday
   -          need to place a-line
   .
   Respiratory
   -          intubated for airway protection
   -          follow  ABG and adjust vent settings, currently no change
   indicated
   -          daily CXR
   .
   Tachycardia
   -          not responsive to IVF makes volume depletion less likely,
   persistent blood loss, UOP has been >30cc/hr
   -          atrial fibrillation for which she received digoxin this
   morning
   -          consider adding back BB, although recently off pressors
   -          DDX: PE, ongoing blood loss, atrial fib, infection
   .
   Leukocytosis
   -          likely stress response, f/u diff, check U/A and sputum, cx
   if spikes

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and esophageal cancer, who presented with hematemesis and was found to have a large clot in the esophagus. She required intubation for airway protection and invasive ventilation. She has been receiving blood transfusions due to persistent bleeding and has a low hematocrit level. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, respiratory distress, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and has bilateral pleural effusions. Her medical history also includes atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia suggest ongoing blood loss and potential hemodynamic instability. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and appropriate fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions may be necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for intubation indicate the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, along with daily chest X-rays, is essential.

3. Infection: The leukocytosis may indicate an inflammatory response, which could be due to infection. Further evaluation of the differential white blood cell count, urinalysis, and sputum culture may be needed to identify the source of infection.

4. Pleural effusions: The increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions"

   Critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and recently diagnosed esophageal cancer with stent placement. She presents with hematemesis/upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was initially hemodynamically stable but became progressively hypotensive due to ongoing bleeding. The patient was resuscitated, intubated for airway control, and is currently off pressors.

The patient's medical history includes a large clot in the distal stent, likely caused by esophageal cancer erosion, which did not require intervention due to the risk of increased bleeding. She has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday and 1 unit today, with a current hematocrit level of 38%. The patient remains tachycardic with atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload, for which she has been given digoxin and is being closely monitored.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 143 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/64 mmHg to 130/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. Her arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 263 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 105 mmHg.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and recently diagnosed esophageal cancer with stent placement. She presents with hematemesis/upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and ongoing bleeding. The patient is intubated for airway control and has been on mechanical ventilation since 05:52 PM on 04-15-2138. An endoscopy performed yesterday showed a large clot in the distal stent, likely due to erosion from esophageal cancer.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (T) of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate (HR) of 143 beats per minute with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 118/64 mmHg to 130/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 10,366 mL and output of 1,370 mL since admission.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 12.0 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 12.0 x 10^9/L, platelet count (Plt) of 286 x 10^9/L, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose level of 107 mg/dL, and potassium (K+) level of 4.0 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH 7.32, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 263, and lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging shows a chest X-ray with pleurodesis, chronic right effusion, and no obvious change. The microbiology results are negative for blood cultures.

The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring with hemodynamic and oxygen saturation checks every four hours, keeping the patient NPO (nothing by mouth), continuing intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), large bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) access, and right internal jugular (IJ) catheter. The patient's atrial fibrillation and tachycardia are being managed with digoxin loading and restarting beta-blockers. Hypotension is being treated with aggressive colloid and intravenous fluids (IVF) and has tapered off pressors. Respiratory failure is managed with intubation for airway control. Pleural effusions are monitored, and cardiac abnormalities are noted.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension"

She was admitted with hematemesis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) initially stable but later decompensated. The source of bleeding is confirmed to be esophageal, and no intervention is possible according to the gastroenterology team. The patient is at high risk of rebleeding and becoming unstable. Her son is expected to arrive today from another country, and at that point, the family will discuss her status. Currently, the patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient has ongoing bleeding from an esophageal source. She is at high risk of rebleeding and becoming unstable. Measures such as HCT transfusion, IV PPI, and NPO are in place to manage this condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is secondary to blood loss in the setting of hematemesis. Transfusion of HCT <25 or HD unstable with precipitous drop in HCT is required. The goal is to keep the mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, and the patient should be off pressors. IV fluid bolus is administered for urine output (UOP) <30cc/hr, and the central venous pressure (CVP) should be maintained between 10"

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, esophageal cancer, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type II. She was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and initially stable but later decompensated and became non-intervenable. The patient's family made the decision to forgo life-sustaining measures (CMO) yesterday after extensive discussion. The goals of care are focused on comfort, with the patient currently on morphine and being considered for a T-piece trial to be off the ventilator.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 71-87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 4,445 mL, output of 4,070 mL, with a net balance of 4,095 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including metoprolol and diltiazem for cardiovascular support, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and various antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits, as are the amylase and lipase levels. The arterial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with esophageal cancer who has undergone a palliative stent placement. She has experienced an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed due to the cancer eroding through the stent. The patient's family met with the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and understands the prognosis. The patient is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) and is receiving a morphine drip for comfort. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 54/43 to 71/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition could worsen, leading to respiratory failure due to the inability to breathe adequately on her own.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, indicating possible hemodynamic instability and the need for careful monitoring and management.
3. Infection: The patient's prolonged intubation and immobility increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections.
4. Bleeding: Although the patient has already experienced a UGI bleed, there is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of esophageal cancer who presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed due to the cancer eroding through a palliative stent. The patient is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) and is unresponsive. She is still mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 54/43 to 71/87 mmHg, heart rate between 92 and 174 beats per minute, and a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's family has been informed of the prognosis, and decisions regarding withdrawal of life support have been made.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to blood loss from the gastrointestinal bleed or the effects of the cancer on the cardiovascular system. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation should be done to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is still mechanically ventilated, indicating respiratory failure. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. Adequate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer, who is currently receiving comfort measures only (CMO) care. He was admitted due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent palliative stenting. The patient's esophagus is clotted off, preventing further bleeding. He is comfortable on morphine infusion and has an endotracheal tube (ET tube) in place to prevent any future UGIB.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and changes in oxygenation should be done. Appropriate antibiotics may be required if infection is suspected.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment for signs of DVT, such as swelling, redness, and warmth in the lower extremities, should be performed. Prophylactic measures like compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin may be considered.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and the use of certain medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Close monitoring for symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or black tarry stools should be done. Proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 blockers may be prescribed as prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of esophageal cancer who has undergone a palliative stent placement. She presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed due to the cancer eroding through the stent. The patient is currently unresponsive and on invasive ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has decreased peripheral pulses. She has been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's family understands her prognosis, and her code status is comfort measures only. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding due to the ongoing erosion of the cancer through the stent.
2. Respiratory complications from invasive ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
3. Cardiovascular complications, such as hypotension or arrhythmias, due to the patient's decreased peripheral pulses.
4. Infection, particularly since the patient is unresponsive and may not be able to protect her airway.
5. Malnutrition or poor glycemic control due to inadequate nutrition support.
6. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
7. Stress-related mucosal damage or ulcers due to prolonged critical illness and immobility.
8. Acute kidney injury or electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration or renal dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with esophageal cancer who has undergone a palliative stent placement. She is currently experiencing an upper gastrointestinal bleed due to the cancer eroding through the stent. The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide a history. 

24-hour events include invasive ventilation being stopped at 09:41 AM and an arterial line being stopped at 10:02 PM. A line was also disconnected. 

Vital signs show a heart rate of 87 (87-116) bpm, blood pressure of 75/43 (54) mmHg, and respiratory rate of 10 (8-16) breaths per minute. The patient's height is 61 inches, and there has been a total intake of 459 mL of fluid and a total output of 80 mL. 

Physical examination reveals diminished pulses in both radial and dorsal pedis arteries, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, and absent extremity movements. Neurological assessment shows the patient to be unresponsive. 

Lab results indicate a hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 172 K/uL, blood glucose level of 184 mg/dL, sodium level of 22 mEq/L, potassium level of 0.4 mg/dL, and chloride level of 103 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.
