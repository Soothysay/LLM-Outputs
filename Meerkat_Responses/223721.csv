   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his
   Cypher DES, and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   #. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol
   #. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Lung sounds are clear
   this am with net output of 1.75L yest. Creatinine rising this am.
   - F/u am CXR.
   - Hold lasix for now and follow I/O (goal < even) given worsening ARF.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - Likely CHF given elevated filling pressures, cxr
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypertension: Continues to be labile
   - Wean nitro gtt keeping SBP <150.
   - Continue home lisinopril, metoprolol
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   - Potential etiologies include pre-renal from poor forward flow,
   intrinsic end-organ damage from hypertension. Last creatinine checked
   was 2 years ago. Will trend for now, if rising check sediment and urine
   lytes. Continue diuresis for now.
   #. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   #. Diabetes
   - Confirm home medication and likely will half glargine while NPO once
   med rec completed.
   - RISS for now, insulin gtt if difficult to control
   - Check A1c
   #. FEN: NPO for now, lyte repletion
   #. Access: swan with access port, PIV
   #. PPx: lansoprazole, SC heparin once sheath pulled
   #. Code: Full
   #. Dispo: CCU for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient underwent evacuation of clot and POBA to the distal RCA. Troponin levels climbed to 5.28, and MB peaked at 92.

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient's condition was managed by evacuating the clot and performing POBA to the distal RCA. The patient is on a regimen of clopidogrel, aspirin, statin, and metoprolol.

2. Acute Systolic HF: An echo showed new systolic dysfunction following an IMI. Lung sounds are clear, and the net output is 1.75L. The patient's creatinine level is rising. Further follow-up is planned, including an am CXR. Lasix is being held for now, and I/O will be monitored (goal < even) due to worsening ARF.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing CHF given elevated filling pressures and CXR findings. Vent settings will be weaned as tolerated.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains labile. Nitro gtt will be weaned while keeping the SBP <150. The patient will continue taking home"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient received treatment for the STEMI/in-stent thrombosis including evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA, as well as medication adjustments to include Plavix, atorvastatin, aspirin, Integrilin, Lopressor, and lisinopril.

The patient also showed signs of respiratory failure likely due to CHF, and hypertension. He is suspected to have acute kidney injury with potential etiologies including pre-renal from poor forward flow and intrinsic end-organ damage from hypertension. Other medical conditions present include a history of stroke, diabetes, and femoral-popliteal bypass.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable with an elevated heart rate, blood pressure fluctuations, and fever. He has been sedated and intubated. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels, along with other abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI/in-stent thrombosis: The patient initially presented with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis. If left untreated or recurrent, this condition can lead to further myocardial damage and potentially life-threatening complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
2. Acute CHF"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including fever, respiratory failure, anemia, hypertension, acute kidney injury, h/o stroke, diabetes, and FEN. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and lack of infiltrates on chest X-ray may suggest a potential infection. Close monitoring for signs of worsening infection is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to be a concern due to acute CHF and potential pneumonia. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously, and appropriate respiratory support should be provided as needed.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped significantly, indicating anemia. Blood transfusion may be required to maintain an adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains labile, and careful monitoring is essential to prevent complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or acute heart failure.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest AKI, which may be due to pre-renal causes or intrinsic renal damage. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his
   Cypher DES, and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   #. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   - will add amlodipine 10mg
   #. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Lung sounds are clear
   this am with net output of 1.75L yest. Creatinine rising this am.
   - F/u am CXR.
   - Hold lasix for now and follow I/O (goal < even) given worsening ARF.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - Likely CHF given elevated filling pressures, improved with diuresis
   overnight
   - Wean vent as tolerated, will continue lasix today for goal of
   additional 1L negative
   # Fever: Pt febrile to temp [**Age over 90 2224**] yesterday, pan-cultured, CXR with no
   evidence of infiltrate
   - f/u micro data
   - f/u CXR, no clear evidence of infiltrate
   # Anemia: pt with HCT drop to 30 this am, likely blood loss related to
   procedure and hematuria, will transfuse for HCT<25, consider CT scan to
   evaluate for RP bleed if continues to drop
   # Hypertension: Continues to be labile in setting of agitation
   - Wean nitro gtt keeping SBP <150.
   - Continue home lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine as above
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   - Potential etiologies include pre-renal from poor forward flow,
   intrinsic end-organ damage from hypertension. Last creatinine checked
   was 2 years ago. Will trend for now, if rising check sediment and urine
   lytes. Continue diuresis for now.
   #. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   #. Diabetes
   - Confirm home medication and likely will half glargine while NPO once
   med rec completed.
   - RISS for now, insulin gtt if difficult to control
   - Check A1c
   #. FEN: NPO for now, lyte repletion
   #. Access: swan with access port, PIV, will DC swan today
   #. PPx: lansoprazole, SC heparin once sheath pulled

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES (drug-eluting stent). The patient also has acute CHF (congestive heart failure), likely ischemic/diastolic.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient experienced a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis. This requires ongoing management to prevent further complications.

2. Acute Systolic HF: The patient has new systolic dysfunction following an IMI (intramyocardial infusion). This may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and reduced cardiac output.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to underlying conditions such as CHF.

4. Fever: The patient is febrile, which may indicate an infection. Cultures have been obtained, and further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly, likely due to blood loss during a procedure and ongoing hematuria. Blood transfusion may be required to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

6. Hypertension: The patient continues to have labile blood pressure readings, particularly in the setting of agitation. Careful management"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and in-stent thrombosis. This is a serious condition that requires immediate intervention to restore blood flow to the heart.

2. Acute CHF: The patient is experiencing acute heart failure, which is characterized by fluid overload in both the left and right sides of the heart. This can lead to shortness of breath, fluid retention, and other complications related to inadequate pumping of the heart.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure, which could be secondary to CHF or a previous aspiration event. This can result in inadequate oxygenation of the blood and the need for mechanical ventilation.

4. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to further damage to the heart and other organs if not managed appropriately.

5. Likely Acute Kidney Injury: The patient may be at risk for acute kidney injury due to pre-renal causes (poor forward flow) or intrinsic end-organ damage from hypertension. Monitoring kidney function through trending creatinine levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his
   Cypher DES, and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   # Altered Mental Status
   Patient is less reponsive on exam this am. He has a h/o L sided
   weakness, although his LUE/LLE appear to be weaker than prior, he is
   not following commands, and has persistent gaze deviation. In the
   setting of paroxysmal severe HTN (up to 250/100) yesterday, would be
   most concerned for an ICH or CVA.
   - Stat noncon CT head
   - Follow neuro exam
   #. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   #. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Was positive 1L yesterday
   and received IV furosemide early this am.
   - Goal fluid balance 1L negative with lasix boluses.
   - PM lytes
   # Respiratory Failure
   Likely from acute heart failure. Tolerated PSV trial this am.
   - Cont spont breathing trials and attempt to wean vent.
   - D/c PA cath
   # Fever: Pt remains febrile, pan-cultured, CXR with no evidence of
   infiltrate
   - f/u micro data
   # Anemia: Pt with hct slowly trending down. Threshold for transfusion
   is under 25. Consider CT A/P if continues to drop.
   - Check PM hct.
   # Hypertension: More stable after acute increase/decrease yest morning,
   now off nitro and labetalol gtts.
   - Cont lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   - Ulytes c/w ATN, creatinine stable.
   - Follow up urine sediment
   - Trend creatinine
   #. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   #. Diabetes
   - Cont glargine and ISS
   #. FEN: NPO for now, lyte repletion
   #. Access: swan with access port, PIV, will DC swan today
   #. PPx: lansoprazole, SC heparin once sheath pulled
   #. Code: Full
   #. Dispo: CCU for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a history of STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient has shown several potential medical complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is less responsive on examination this morning, with a history of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and persistent altered mental status. These symptoms raise concern for an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

2. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and in-stent thrombosis of the distal RCA. Management involved evacuation of the clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTC) to the distal RCA. The patient is currently on a regimen including clopidogrel (Plavix), aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

3. Acute Systolic HF: An echocardiogram revealed new systolic dysfunction following an ischemic myocardial injury. The patient was positive for 1L yesterday and received intravenous furosemide early this morning. The goal is to achieve a fluid balance of 1L negative with lasix boluses and manage electrolyte imbalances.

   Patient is a 62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his
   Cypher DES, and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   # Altered Mental Status
   Patient is less reponsive on exam this am. He has a h/o L sided
   weakness, although his LUE/LLE appear to be weaker than prior, he is
   not following commands, and has persistent gaze deviation. In the
   setting of paroxysmal severe HTN (up to 250/100) yesterday, would be
   most concerned for an ICH or CVA.
   - Stat noncon CT head
   - Follow neuro exam
   #. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   #. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Was positive 1L yesterday
   and received IV furosemide early this am.
   - Goal fluid balance 1L negative with lasix boluses.
   - PM lytes
   # Respiratory Failure
   Likely from acute heart failure. Tolerated PSV trial this am.
   - Cont spont breathing trials and attempt to wean vent.
   - D/c PA cath
   # Fever: Pt remains febrile, pan-cultured, CXR with no evidence of
   infiltrate
   - f/u micro data
   # Anemia: Pt with hct slowly trending down. Threshold for transfusion
   is under 25. Consider CT A/P if continues to drop.
   - Check PM hct.
   # Hypertension: More stable after acute increase/decrease yest morning,
   now off nitro and labetalol gtts.
   - Cont lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   - Ulytes c/w ATN, creatinine stable.
   - Follow up urine sediment
   - Trend creatinine
   #. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   #. Diabetes
   - Cont glargine and ISS
   #. FEN: NPO for now, lyte repletion
   #. Access: swan with access port, PIV, will DC swan today
   #. PPx: lansoprazole, SC heparin once sheath pulled
   #. Code: Full

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient's condition has been complex and dynamic, with various medical complications arising during his ICU stay.

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has shown decreased responsiveness on examination, with a history of left-sided weakness. There is persistent gaze deviation, and the patient is not following commands. This could be indicative of an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). A stat noncontrast CT head has been ordered, and the neuro exam will be followed up.

2. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient had an acute myocardial infarction and in-stent thrombosis of the distal RCA. The clot was evacuated, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with balloon angioplasty was performed. The patient is currently on Plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

3. Acute Systolic HF: An echocardiogram revealed new systolic dysfunction post-infarction myocardial ischemia. The patient received intravenous furosemide and is being managed with goal fluid balance of 1 liter negative with lasix boluses. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his
   Cypher DES, and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   #. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   - will add amlodipine 10mg
   #. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Lung sounds are clear
   this am with net output of 1.75L yest. Creatinine rising this am.
   - F/u am CXR.
   - Hold lasix for now and follow I/O (goal < even) given worsening ARF.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - Likely CHF given elevated filling pressures, improved with diuresis
   overnight
   - Wean vent as tolerated, will continue lasix today for goal of
   additional 1L negative
   # Fever: Pt febrile to temp [**Age over 90 2224**] yesterday, pan-cultured, CXR with no
   evidence of infiltrate
   - f/u micro data
   - f/u CXR, no clear evidence of infiltrate
   # Anemia: pt with HCT drop to 30 this am, likely blood loss related to
   procedure and hematuria, will transfuse for HCT<25, consider CT scan to
   evaluate for RP bleed if continues to drop
   # Hypertension: Continues to be labile in setting of agitation
   - Wean nitro gtt keeping SBP <150.
   - Continue home lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine as above
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   - Potential etiologies include pre-renal from poor forward flow,
   intrinsic end-organ damage from hypertension. Last creatinine checked
   was 2 years ago. Will trend for now, if rising check sediment and urine
   lytes. Continue diuresis for now.
   #. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   #. Diabetes
   - Confirm home medication and likely will half glargine while NPO once
   med rec completed.
   - RISS for now, insulin gtt if difficult to control
   - Check A1c
   #. FEN: NPO for now, lyte repletion
   #. Access: swan with access port, PIV, will DC swan today
   #. PPx: lansoprazole, SC heparin once sheath pulled

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient has been managed with evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. He is currently receiving multiple medications including clopidogrel, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and amlodipine.

The patient also has acute systolic HF, as evidenced by an echocardiogram showing new systolic dysfunction post-infarct myocardial injury (IMI). Lung sounds are clear, but there is a net output of 1.75L yesterday. The patient's creatinine level is rising this morning, so diuretics will be continued, and fluid intake/output (I/O) will be monitored closely.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to CHF given the elevated filling pressures and improvement with diuretics overnight. Ventilator weaning will be done as tolerated, and lasix will be continued today for an additional 1L negative output.

Additionally, the patient has fever, and blood cultures have been sent. A chest X-ray showed no evidence of infiltrate. Microbiology data and repeat chest X-ray will be followed up.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his
   Cypher DES, and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   #. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   - will add amlodipine 10mg
   #. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Lung sounds are clear
   this am with net output of 1.75L yest. Creatinine rising this am.
   - F/u am CXR.
   - Hold lasix for now and follow I/O (goal < even) given worsening ARF.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - Likely CHF given elevated filling pressures, improved with diuresis
   overnight
   - Wean vent as tolerated, will continue lasix today for goal of
   additional 1L negative
   # Fever: Pt febrile to temp [**Age over 90 2224**] yesterday, pan-cultured, CXR with no
   evidence of infiltrate
   - f/u micro data
   - f/u CXR, no clear evidence of infiltrate
   # Anemia: pt with HCT drop to 30 this am, likely blood loss related to
   procedure and hematuria, will transfuse for HCT<25, consider CT scan to
   evaluate for RP bleed if continues to drop
   # Hypertension: Continues to be labile in setting of agitation
   - Wean nitro gtt keeping SBP <150.
   - Continue home lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine as above
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   - Potential etiologies include pre-renal from poor forward flow,
   intrinsic end-organ damage from hypertension. Last creatinine checked
   was 2 years ago. Will trend for now, if rising check sediment and urine
   lytes. Continue diuresis for now.
   #. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   #. Diabetes
   - Confirm home medication and likely will half glargine while NPO once
   med rec completed.
   - RISS for now, insulin gtt if difficult to control
   - Check A1c
   #. FEN: NPO for now, lyte repletion
   #. Access: swan with access port, PIV, will DC swan today
   #. PPx: lansoprazole, SC heparin once sheath pulled
   #. Code: Full

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic or diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the distal RCA. He is currently on multiple medications including clopidogrel, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and amlodipine.

The patient's recent events include an episode of hypotension (BP 70s/40s) that was initially treated with labetalol but was later stopped due to concerns of worsening renal function (ARF). The patient received a 500cc bolus and is now on amlodipine. The patient also has ongoing fevers, with no evidence of infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a possible non-infectious cause. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been dropping, likely due to blood loss related to the procedure and hematuria. The patient is planned for blood transfusion if Hct falls below 25.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 162/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension requiring intervention, has an elevated lactate level indicating potential tissue hypoperfusion, and is showing signs of acute kidney injury as indicated by the FENa and FEurea values. The patient also has a fever and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is being treated for it.

The patient's vital signs show hypertension and tachycardia. The heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient's respiratory status is being supported with mechanical ventilation, and the ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis with compensatory metabolic acidosis.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels, suggesting myocardial injury. Other labs such as liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are abnormal.

The patient's diagnosis includes fever, malignant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, acute myocardial infarction, acute diastolic heart failure, and acute respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, kidney injury progressing to renal failure, sepsis, and further cardiac complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and urine output. Frequent reassessment of electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his
   Cypher DES, and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   #. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   - will add amlodipine 10mg
   #. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Lung sounds are clear
   this am with net output of 1.75L yest. Creatinine rising this am.
   - F/u am CXR.
   - Hold lasix for now and follow I/O (goal < even) given worsening ARF.
   # Respiratory Failure
   - Likely CHF given elevated filling pressures, improved with diuresis
   overnight
   - Wean vent as tolerated, will continue lasix today for goal of
   additional 1L negative
   # Fever: Pt febrile to temp [**Age over 90 2224**] yesterday, pan-cultured, CXR with no
   evidence of infiltrate
   - f/u micro data
   - f/u CXR, no clear evidence of infiltrate
   # Anemia: pt with HCT drop to 30 this am, likely blood loss related to
   procedure and hematuria, will transfuse for HCT<25, consider CT scan to
   evaluate for RP bleed if continues to drop
   # Hypertension: Continues to be labile in setting of agitation
   - Wean nitro gtt keeping SBP <150.
   - Continue home lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine as above
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   - Potential etiologies include pre-renal from poor forward flow,
   intrinsic end-organ damage from hypertension. Last creatinine checked
   was 2 years ago. Will trend for now, if rising check sediment and urine
   lytes. Continue diuresis for now.
   #. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   #. Diabetes
   - Confirm home medication and likely will half glargine while NPO once
   med rec completed.
   - RISS for now, insulin gtt if difficult to control
   - Check A1c
   #. FEN: NPO for now, lyte repletion
   #. Access: swan with access port, PIV, will DC swan today
   #. PPx: lansoprazole, SC heparin once sheath pulled
   #. Code: Full

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES. The patient was admitted with acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. STEMI/in-stent thrombosis: The patient has a history of STEMI and in-stent thrombosis, which increases the risk of further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

2. Acute systolic heart failure: The patient is experiencing new systolic dysfunction post-intracoronary intervention (IMI). This can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and decreased cardiac output.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest potential AKI, which can be caused by pre-renal factors (e.g., poor forward flow) or intrinsic renal damage from hypertension. Monitoring and managing fluid balance, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and treating the underlying cause are important in preventing further kidney damage.

4. Hypertension: The patient continues to have labile blood pressure readings, particularly in the setting of agitation. Proper management of blood pressure is crucial to prevent end-organ damage, including hypertensive encephalopathy or stroke.

5. Fever: The patient's febrile state requires investigation for potential sources of infection, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infection."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has a history of delirium/confusion, fever, hypertension (malignant), type II diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, acute diastolic heart failure, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 78-90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/68 to 178/83 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently receiving propofol and labetalol infusions, as well as other medications such as lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin T levels. The electrocardiogram (EKG) shows changes consistent with an acute myocardial infarction.

The patient has been receiving respiratory support through CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 276, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 25 mEq/L.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,901 mL and total output of 1,905 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 4 mL. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is 36/21 mmHg, and blood cultures have been obtained.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and further deterioration of heart function leading to cardiogenic shock. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, blood pressure, and cardiac function. Additionally, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued for the suspected VAP, and measures to prevent DVT and stress ulcer bleeding should be implemented. Frequent reassessment of the patient's mental status is necessary due to the presence of delirium/confusion."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention:

1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and a clot formation in the stent. This was managed by removing the clot and using percutaneous intervention to open the blocked coronary artery.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, and labetalol has been restarted to control it. The patient is also on medications such as aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril for ongoing management of hypertension.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, indicating anemia. A transfusion threshold of under 25 has been set, and consideration for a CT angiography (CTA) may be needed if the hemoglobin continues to drop.

4. Fever: The patient has a fever, which appears to be related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) have been started for treatment.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure due to acute heart failure. His mental status has improved, but it is unclear if he still needs air"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES,
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   2. Hypertension: Patient was again hypertensive yesterday and labetalol
   was restarted.
   - Cont lisinopril and amlodipine
   - continue IV labetalol for now and then transition to PO labetalol
   after extubated
   3. Anemia
   Pt with hct slowly trending down. Threshold for transfusion is under
   25. Consider CT A/P if continues to drop.
   4. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP.
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   5. Respiratory Failure
   Likely from acute heart failure. Patient
s mental status has improved,
   but it is unclear if he may still need airway protection.
   - discontinue propafol and recheck RSBI
   - if patient
s mental status improves, extubate
   6. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Was positive 1L yesterday
   and received IV furosemide early this am.
   - Goal fluid balance 1L negative with lasix boluses.
   - PM lytes
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient is less reponsive on exam this am. He has a h/o L sided
   weakness, although his LUE/LLE appear to be weaker than prior, he is
   not following commands, and has persistent gaze deviation. In the
   setting of paroxysmal severe HTN (up to 250/100) yesterday, would be
   most concerned for an ICH or CVA.
   - Stat noncon CT head
   - Follow neuro exam
   8. Acute Kidney Injury
   Differential diagnosis likely ATN.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES (drug-eluting stent). He also has acute congestive heart failure likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. 

The patient's current condition includes hypertension, anemia, fever, respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, altered mental status, and acute kidney injury. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. In-stent thrombosis recurrence: There is a risk of further clot formation within the stent, leading to recurrent myocardial infarction or other cardiac complications.

2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's acute systolic heart failure may worsen, resulting in fluid accumulation, shortness of breath, and reduced cardiac output.

3. Infection: The patient's fever suggests an ongoing infection, which could be related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or another source. Timely identification and treatment are crucial to prevent its progression.

4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and gaze deviation raise concerns for possible cerebrovascular events such as an ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. A stat noncontrast CT head should be performed to evaluate for these conditions.

5. Acute kidney injury progression: The patient's renal function is compromised, and it is essential to monitor and"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES,
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   Managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. Trop climbed to
   5.28, MB peaked at 92.
   - Cont plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   2. Hypertension: Patient was again hypertensive yesterday and labetalol
   was restarted.
   - Cont lisinopril and amlodipine
   - continue IV labetalol for now and then transition to PO labetalol
   after extubated
   3. Anemia
   Pt with hct slowly trending down. Threshold for transfusion is under
   25. Consider CT A/P if continues to drop.
   4. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP.
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   5. Respiratory Failure
   Likely from acute heart failure. Patient
s mental status has improved,
   but it is unclear if he may still need airway protection.
   - discontinue propafol and recheck RSBI
   - if patient
s mental status improves, extubate
   6. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI. Was positive 1L yesterday
   and received IV furosemide early this am.
   - Goal fluid balance 1L negative with lasix boluses.
   - PM lytes
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient is less reponsive on exam this am. He has a h/o L sided
   weakness, although his LUE/LLE appear to be weaker than prior, he is
   not following commands, and has persistent gaze deviation. In the
   setting of paroxysmal severe HTN (up to 250/100) yesterday, would be
   most concerned for an ICH or CVA.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient has been managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. The Trop level climbed to 5.28, and MB peaked at 92.

The patient has several ongoing medical conditions that require attention:
1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient is being managed with continued antiplatelet therapy (plavix, aspirin), statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.
2. Hypertension: The patient was again hypertensive yesterday, and labetalol was restarted. The plan is to continue lisinopril and amlodipine, with IV labetalol for now and transition to PO labetalol after extubation.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is slowly trending down. A threshold for transfusion is under consideration, and a CT A/P may be needed if the HCT continues to drop.
4. Fever: The etiology of the fever appears likely related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Vanc and Zosyn will continue to be administered.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure from acute heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont high dose plavix , aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   - follow-up with patient and PCP regarding medication adherence
   2. Hypertension:
   Patient was again hypertensive yesterday and labetalol was restarted.
   - Cont lisinopril and amlodipine
   - continue IV labetalol for now and then transition to PO labetalol
   after extubated
   - will aim for tight BP monitoring in the setting of extubation and
   peri-extubation
   3. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased secretions
   - treat for 7 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia
   4. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI.
   - Goal fluid balance 1L negative with lasix boluses of 120 furosemide.
   - PM lytes
   5. Anemia
   Pt with hct slowly trending down. Threshold for transfusion is under 21
   given no evidence of end-organ ischemia.
   - recheck PM Hct
   6. Respiratory Failure
   Likely from acute heart failure. Patient
s respiratory status is
   markedly improved and mental status is improved.
   - extubate today
   - low threshold for reintubation if patient has altered mental status
   or respiratory distress
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient
s altered mental status is improved.
   - Follow neuro exam
   8. Acute Kidney Injury
   Differential diagnosis likely ATN and has improved slowly.
   - continue trend
   9. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   10. Diabetes
   - Cont glargine and ISS

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient's current condition includes hypertension, fever, acute systolic HF, anemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute kidney injury, history of stroke, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient experienced a thrombosis in his coronary stent, leading to a STEMI. This condition requires ongoing management with antiplatelet therapy, statin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and lifestyle modifications.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medical treatment. Tight control of blood pressure is essential to prevent further cardiac complications.

3. Fever: The patient has an elevated temperature, which could be indicative of an infection. This may require further investigation and treatment for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

4. Acute Systolic HF: The patient's heart function has deteriorated, leading to systolic dysfunction post-myocardial infarction (MI). Close monitoring of fluid balance and use of diuretics are necessary to manage this condition.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are decreasing, indicating anemia. Regular transfusion may be required to maintain adequate oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and previous myocardial infarction, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving labetalol, furosemide, heparin, and various antibiotics. Vital signs are stable with a slight decrease in hemoglobin levels. The patient's oxygenation has improved with increased PEEP, but this will need to be decreased prior to extubation. Fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating adequate fluid removal. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis with adequate oxygenation. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, potassium, and troponin T levels. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is not assessed. The assessment and plan include anemia, delirium, fever, hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and the possibility of prolonged ventilation should be considered, especially if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Infection: The patient has received multiple antibiotics, indicating a concern for infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or changes in mental status, is necessary.
3. Fluid overload: Despite the negative fluid balance, there is still a risk of fluid"

   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont high dose plavix , aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   - follow-up with patient and PCP regarding medication adherence
   2. Hypertension:
   Patient was again hypertensive yesterday and labetalol was restarted.
   - Cont lisinopril and amlodipine
   - continue IV labetalol for now and then transition to PO labetalol
   after extubated
   - will aim for tight BP monitoring in the setting of extubation and
   peri-extubation
   3. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased secretions
   - treat for 7 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia
   4. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI.
   - Goal fluid balance 1L negative with lasix boluses of 120 furosemide.
   - PM lytes
   5. Anemia
   Pt with hct slowly trending down. Threshold for transfusion is under 21
   given no evidence of end-organ ischemia.
   - recheck PM Hct
   6. Respiratory Failure
   Likely from acute heart failure. Patient
s respiratory status is
   markedly improved and mental status is improved.
   - extubate today
   - low threshold for reintubation if patient has altered mental status
   or respiratory distress
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient
s altered mental status is improved.
   - Follow neuro exam
   8. Acute Kidney Injury
   Differential diagnosis likely ATN and has improved slowly.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES (drug-eluting stent). The patient also has acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic or diastolic dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. STEMI/In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient had a recent thrombosis in his coronary artery despite having a stent placed four years ago. This increases the risk of future thrombotic events and potential cardiac complications.

2. Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive multiple times during his ICU stay. Poorly controlled hypertension can lead to further end-organ damage and increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

3. Fever: The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is a common complication in critically ill patients and can be associated with increased mortality if not promptly identified and treated.

4. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of new systolic dysfunction secondary to an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). This condition can lead to further decline in cardiac function and may require ongoing management with medications and possibly additional interventions.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is slowly trending down, indicating a potential development of"

The patient has experienced several medical complications during his ICU stay.

1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient had a thrombosis in his stent, which was managed by clot evacuation and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently on high-dose Plavix, aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. Follow-up with the patient and primary care physician regarding medication adherence is recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to fluid overload and poor airway protection. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, and efforts are being made to wean him off as tolerated. Aggressive diuresis is also being performed to remove excess fluid. Deep suctioning is being done to manage secretions.

3. Mental status change: The patient is sedated and does not follow commands. Further evaluation of his mental status is needed, including checking thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, and vitamin B12 levels. If the mental status change does not improve, consideration should be given to performing an MRI of"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic.
   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont high dose plavix , aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   - follow-up with patient and PCP regarding medication adherence
   2. Hypertension:
   Patient was again hypertensive yesterday and labetalol was restarted.
   - Cont lisinopril and amlodipine
   - continue IV labetalol for now and then transition to PO labetalol
   after extubated
   - will aim for tight BP monitoring in the setting of extubation and
   peri-extubation
   3. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased secretions
   - treat for 7 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia
   4. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI.
   - Goal fluid balance 1L negative with lasix boluses of 120 furosemide.
   - PM lytes
   5. Anemia
   Pt with hct slowly trending down. Threshold for transfusion is under 21
   given no evidence of end-organ ischemia.
   - recheck PM Hct
   6. Respiratory Failure
   Likely from acute heart failure. Patient
s respiratory status is
   markedly improved and mental status is improved.
   - extubate today
   - low threshold for reintubation if patient has altered mental status
   or respiratory distress
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient
s altered mental status is improved.
   - Follow neuro exam
   8. Acute Kidney Injury
   Differential diagnosis likely ATN and has improved slowly.
   - continue trend

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient has undergone several interventions and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The note mentions treating the patient with a 7-day course of vancomycin and Zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has shown signs of AKI, possibly due to acute heart failure or other factors. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, likely secondary to acute heart failure. However, the patient's respiratory status has improved with treatment.
4. Altered mental status: The patient initially presented with altered mental status, which has also improved with treatment. Continued neurologic monitoring is essential.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which requires ongoing management with antihypertensive medications.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is trending downward, indicating the need for further evaluation and potential transfusion.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis measures should be taken"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) due to a blood clot in the coronary artery, leading to blockage of the stent placed in his coronary artery.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is evidence of fluid overload and the need for airway protection.

3. Mental Status Change: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to sedation or other causes. Further evaluation is needed, including checking thyroid function (TSH), folate, and vitamin B12 levels.

4. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure that requires medication management.

5. Fever: The patient had a fever, which was likely related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently afebrile and receiving a 7-day course of antibiotics for VAP.

6. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has new systolic dysfunction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure (diastolic), hypertension, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of heart failure. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

During the course of the patient's stay in the ICU, several events occurred. The patient had loose stools and was started on an antibiotic for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was also found to be vitamin B12 deficient and began receiving B12 shots. The patient's blood pressure was difficult to control, and labetalol was titrated up. Lasix drip was continued for fluid management. An echocardiogram showed improvements, with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation. 

The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 74-81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/60-191/78 mmHg, respiratory rate at 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 86.1 kg to 79.6 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,894 mL since 12 AM. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of baseline MS, unknown Coumadin use or history of atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient was admitted to the ICU with a presentation of altered mental status, respiratory failure, anemia, delirium/confusion, malignant hypertension, and acute diastolic heart failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by Clostridium difficile infection, for which he is receiving appropriate treatment. He also has a history of vitamin B12 deficiency, which has been addressed with B12 shots.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support system. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and early identification of any signs of infection are crucial.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation. Monitoring of cardiac function and fluid status is essential to prevent worsening of heart failure symptoms.

3. Hypertension: The patient has malignant hypertension, which can lead to end-organ damage if not managed appropriately. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and timely intervention are necessary to control hypertension.

4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, and careful management of blood glucose levels is important to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient has a history of stroke, diabetes, hypertension, and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, mental status change, hypertension, fever, acute systolic HF, anemia, acute kidney injury, and h/o stroke. The patient is being treated with various medications and interventions aimed at managing these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient's history of in-stent thrombosis may increase the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further lung complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Mental Status Change: The patient's mental status change may be indicative of neurological issues, including the possibility of a stroke or delirium.
4. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension could lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney damage.
5. Fever: The patient's fever may indicate an infection, potentially leading to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
6. Acute Systolic HF: The patient's new systolic dysfunction may worsen heart failure symptoms and reduce cardiac output.
7. Anemia: Severe anemia can result in fatigue,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. He underwent clot evacuation and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications since admission. These include:

1. STEMI/In-Stent Thrombosis: The cause of this thrombosis is unclear, occurring four years after stent placement. Management includes continued antiplatelet therapy (Plavix), high-dose aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. Follow-up with the patient and primary care physician regarding medication adherence is recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had volume overload and inability to protect the airway, leading to reintubation. He continues to be ventilated and efforts are being made to wean him off the ventilator. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid overload, and daily respiratory system assessment is planned.

3. Mental Status Change: The patient's mental status has changed, possibly related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Repletion of B12 is underway, and thyroid function tests are normal. An MRI of the head may be considered if mental status does not improve, and an EEG is being repeated to evaluate for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. He underwent evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. The patient has a history of stroke and diabetes. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient experienced a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and thrombosis in his coronary stent. This condition requires ongoing management with antiplatelet medications, statins, and other cardiac supportive measures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient has shown mental status changes, which could be related to various factors such as hypoxia, stroke, or electrolyte imbalances. Further evaluation and management are necessary.

4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive medications.

5. Fever: The patient had a fever, which may be related to an infection such as VAP. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and source control measures should be implemented.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA.

- The patient is currently being managed with multiple medications including clopidogrel, high-dose aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. Follow-up with a nurse practitioner (NP) and primary care physician (PCP) is planned to discuss medication adherence.

- The patient experienced respiratory failure initially due to volume overload and inability to protect the airway, possibly secondary to mental status changes (MS change). The patient was extubated on [**4-13**] but reintubated on [**4-14**]. White blood cell count (WBC) is down, and there is no fever on vancomycin/Zosyn.

- The patient's mental status change is being evaluated, and vitamin B12 deficiency has been identified and is being repleted. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and folate levels are normal. An MRI head may be considered if mental status does not improve, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) is"

   24 Hour Events:
 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING - At [**2173-4-16**] 02:15 AM
   CXR: Endotracheal tube has been repositioned, with tip now about 6 cm
   above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm but
   side port is near the GE junction level. Heart size is normal, and
   pulmonary edema has resolved. Marked improved aeration at the lung
   bases with residual patchy opacities in the retrocardiac regions.
   Apparent resolution of right pleural effusion and decreased but small
   residual left pleural effusion.
   Labetalol increased to 600mg PO TID
   MRI: Prelim with mult small acute infarcts, largest L corona radiate, L
   parietal/occipital
   Neuro: Agree wtih MRI
   EEG:IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow background with occasional
   epochs of diffuse attenutation. These findings are suggestive of a
   widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
   structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infections are
   among the most common causes. Hypoxia is another possible explanation.
   Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing although
   encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. There are no clearly
   epileptiform features.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty to the distal RCA. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, mental status changes, hypertension, fever, acute systolic heart failure, anemia, acute kidney injury, h/o stroke, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient experienced a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and thrombosis in his coronary stent. This condition can lead to further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, recurrent myocardial infarction, or cardiogenic shock.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This could progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is a common complication in critically ill patients.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient is sedated and not following commands, indicating altered mental status. This may be due to hypoxia, medication effects, metabolic disturbances, or infections. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should also be considered.

4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that needs to be managed carefully, especially during extubation and post-extubation"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot and
   POBA to distal RCA.
   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   2. Respiratory Failure
   CXR shows resolution of volume overload. Less secretions. Appears to
   have improved on vanc/zosyn. Remains intubated given concern for mental
   status.
   - Pressure support trial
   - wean propofol
   - deep suction PRN
   - f/u cx data (urine legionella neg, RPR neg, C diff neg)
   - VAP: continue vanco/zosyn (day 1 of 8: [**2173-4-11**])
   3. Mental status change: EEG with diffuse slowing, MRI with small acute
   infarcts although not enough to account for his altered mental status
   per neuro.
   - appreciate neuro following, will discuss with them re: prognosis
   - B12 low so repleting
   4. Hypertension:
   Remains hypertensive on regimen below, but will allow autoregulation in
   setting of acute infarcts.
   - Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10 and PO labetolol 600 TID
   5. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased secretions.
   Afebrile
   - treat for 8 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia (day 1 [**2173-4-11**])
   6. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - continue lasix gtt to balance tube feed inputs with goal fluid
   balance even.
   7. Anemia
   Hct stable. Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no evidence of
   end-organ ischemia.
   - recheck in am.
   8. Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN. Bumped recently likely from diuresis.
    - continue trend
   9. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   - Consider heparin gtt given PAF

The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely ischemic/diastolic. He underwent emergency coronary intervention, including evacuation of clot and percutaneous orbital atrial revascularization (POBA) to the distal RCA. The patient remains intubated due to concerns about his mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient had a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis, which was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to the distal RCA. It is unclear what triggered this thrombosis 4 years after stent placement. The patient is being continued on clopidogrel, high-dose aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to have improved on the ventilator, with resolution of volume overload as shown on the chest X-ray. However, the patient remains intubated due to concerns about mental status changes. A pressure support trial, weaning of propofol, deep suctioning as needed, and follow-up CX data are planned.

3. Mental status change: The patient has an abnormal EEG with diffuse slowing, and MRI shows small acute infarcts, although not enough to account for his altered mental status per neuro"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot and
   POBA to distal RCA.
   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   2. Respiratory Failure
   CXR shows resolution of volume overload. Less secretions. Appears to
   have improved on vanc/zosyn. Remains intubated given concern for mental
   status.
   - Pressure support trial
   - wean propofol
   - deep suction PRN
   - f/u cx data (urine legionella neg, RPR neg, C diff neg)
   - VAP: continue vanco/zosyn (day 1 of 8: [**2173-4-11**])
   3. Mental status change: EEG with diffuse slowing, MRI with small acute
   infarcts although not enough to account for his altered mental status
   per neuro.
   - appreciate neuro following, will discuss with them re: prognosis
   - B12 low so repleting
   4. Hypertension:
   Remains hypertensive on regimen below, but will allow autoregulation in
   setting of acute infarcts.
   - Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10 and PO labetolol 600 TID
   5. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased secretions.
   Afebrile
   - treat for 8 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia (day 1 [**2173-4-11**])
   6. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - continue lasix gtt to balance tube feed inputs with goal fluid
   balance even.
   7. Anemia
   Hct stable. Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no evidence of
   end-organ ischemia.
   - recheck in am.
   8. Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN. Bumped recently likely from diuresis.
    - continue trend
   9. h/o Stroke
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   - Consider heparin gtt given PAF

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent clot evacuation and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the distal right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, mental status changes, hypertension, fever, acute systolic heart failure, anemia, acute kidney injury, history of stroke, and diabetes.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. STEMI/in-stent thrombosis: There is a risk of further thrombosis or re-occurrence of the STEMI, especially since the patient had in-stent thrombosis four years after stent placement. Monitoring and management of antiplatelet therapy, such as clopidogrel and aspirin, will be important to prevent future thrombotic events.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated due to concern for mental status changes. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected VAP. Regular suctioning and weaning off propofol may be necessary to improve respiratory function.

3. Mental status changes: The patient has diffuse"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical history and current condition can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with STEMI (heart attack) and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES stent, along with acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient underwent clot evacuation and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA (right coronary artery). 

The patient was initially extubated but had to be reintubated due to respiratory failure caused by volume overload, inability to protect the airway, and secretions with low lung volumes. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased and there is no fever, indicating that the infection is under control.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and the ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 104, plateau pressure is 18 cmH2O, and the patient's oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient's mental status has changed, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. The patient's electrolytes, including calcium and magnesium levels, are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, anemia, delirium, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and heart failure. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a chest X-ray, which showed marked improvement in lung aeration but residual patchy opacities, resolution of right pleural effusion, and decreased left pleural effusion. The patient's EEG revealed abnormal findings suggestive of widespread encephalopathy. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygenation, and ventilation parameters is essential to ensure adequate oxygenation and prevent further deterioration.
2. Hypertension: The patient has malignant hypertension, which requires aggressive blood pressure control to prevent end-organ damage. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and administration of antihypertensive medications are necessary.
3. Heart Failure: The patient is experiencing acute diastolic heart failure. Continuous monitoring of cardiac function and fluid balance is crucial to prevent fluid overload and cardiac complications.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and insulin administration are required to maintain glycemic control and prevent hyperglycemic crises.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which needs to be corrected through appropriate transfusion therapy to improve"

 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING - At [**2173-4-16**] 02:15 AM
   CXR: Endotracheal tube has been repositioned, with tip now about 6 cm
   above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm but
   side port is near the GE junction level. Heart size is normal, and
   pulmonary edema has resolved. Marked improved aeration at the lung
   bases with residual patchy opacities in the retrocardiac regions.
   Apparent resolution of right pleural effusion and decreased but small
   residual left pleural effusion.
   Labetalol increased to 600mg PO TID
   MRI: Prelim with mult small acute infarcts, largest L corona radiate, L
   parietal/occipital
   Neuro: Agree wtih MRI
   EEG:IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow background with occasional
   epochs of diffuse attenutation. These findings are suggestive of a
   widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
   structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infections are
   among the most common causes. Hypoxia is another possible explanation.
   Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing although
   encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. There are no clearly
   epileptiform features.

   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot and
   POBA to distal RCA.
   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   2. Respiratory Failure
   CXR shows resolution of volume overload. Less secretions. Appears to
   have improved on vanc/Zosyn. Remains intubated given concern for mental
   status.
   - continue vent, wean as tolerated: AC 550/15/8/40%
   - wean propofol  in attempt to wean vent
   - diurese aggressively, I/O goal: neg 3 liters, continue lasix gtt
   - deep suction
   - f/u repeat sputum cx and blood cx
   - VAP: continue vanco/Zosyn day [**6-11**] (day 1: [**2173-4-11**])
   - daily RSBI/SBT as tolerated
   2. Mental status change:
   - appreciate neuro following
   - B12 low so repleting;  TSH, folate WNL
   - consider MRI head if MS does not improve
   - F/U EEG to eval for non convulsive status
   3. Hypertension:
   Labetalol gtt weaned. Hypertensive overnight.
   - Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10 and PO labetolol 400 TID,
   uptitrate as tolerated
   - may need to start labetalol/nitro gtt peri-extubation
   - will aim for tight BP monitoring in the setting of extubation and
   peri-extubation
   4. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased secretions.
   Afebrile
   - treat for 8 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia (day 1 [**2173-4-11**])
   5. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI.  EF 30-40% [**2173-4-9**]. EF
   improved yesterday 50-55%
   - continue lasix gtt for improved respiratory status until Cr bumps; cr
   stable
   - PM lytes
   6. Anemia
   Hct stable at 23-25.  Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no
   evidence of end-organ ischemia.
   - recheck PM Hct
   8. Acute Kidney Injury
   Differential diagnosis likely ATN and is improving slowly. Cr stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot and
   POBA to distal RCA.
   1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   2. Respiratory Failure
   CXR shows resolution of volume overload. Less secretions. Appears to
   have improved on vanc/zosyn. Remains intubated given concern for mental
   status.
   - Pressure support trial
   - wean propofol
   - deep suction PRN
   - f/u cx data (urine legionella neg, RPR neg, C diff neg)
   - VAP: continue vanco/zosyn (day 1 of 8: [**2173-4-11**])
   3. Mental status change: EEG with diffuse slowing, MRI with small acute
   infarcts although not enough to account for his altered mental status
   per neuro.
   - appreciate neuro following, will discuss with them re: prognosis
   - B12 low so repleting
   4. Hypertension:
   Remains hypertensive on regimen below, but will allow autoregulation in
   setting of acute infarcts.
   - Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10 and PO labetolol 600 TID
   5. Fever
   Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased secretions.
   Afebrile
   - treat for 8 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia (day 1 [**2173-4-11**])
   6. Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - continue lasix gtt to balance tube feed inputs with goal fluid
   balance even.
   7. Anemia
   Hct stable. Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no evidence of
   end-organ ischemia.
   - recheck in am.
   8. Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN. Bumped recently likely from diuresis.
    - continue trend

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent evacuation of a clot and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. He remains intubated due to concerns about his mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient had a myocardial infarction and in-stent thrombosis of his coronary stent. This condition can lead to further complications such as recurrent myocardial ischemia or infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently compromised, as evidenced by his need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can be caused by infection from the endotracheal tube.

3. Mental Status Change: The patient has experienced altered mental status, which may be due to various factors including hypoxia, sepsis, or neurological complications. Further evaluation and monitoring are required to determine the cause and prognosis.

4. Hypertension: The patient remains hypertensive despite medication. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to complications such as cardiac hypertrophy, stroke, or kidney damage.

5. Fever: The patient's fever may indicate an infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure. The patient underwent evacuation of a clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. The patient's current condition is stable, with improvements in respiratory function and mental status. However, the patient still has hematuria and bloody secretions, and is hypertensive. The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, mental status change, strokes/atrial fibrillation, acute systolic heart failure, hypertension, fever, anemia, acute kidney injury, and diabetes. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antiplatelet agents, statins, beta-blockers, and diuretics. The patient's family has been notified.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is still compromised, as indicated by the presence of secretions and the need for continued pressure support.
2. Mental Status Change: The patient experienced an altered mental status, which has partially improved but requires further evaluation and monitoring.
3. Strokes/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of strokes and atrial fibrillation, which may require further management and treatment.
4. Acute Systolic Heart Failure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot and
   POBA to distal RCA.
   STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   Respiratory Failure
   CXR shows resolution of volume overload. Less secretions, but still a
   lot. Appears to have improved on vanc/zosyn. Mental status is much
   improved compared to yesterday, patient is following commands and now
   has a Gag. Patient still not coughing despite secretions.
   - Continue pressure support
   - keep propofol off
   - deep suction PRN
   - f/u cx data (urine legionella neg, RPR neg, C diff neg)
   - VAP: continue vanco/zosyn (day 1 of 8: [**2173-4-11**])
   Mental status change: EEG with diffuse slowing, MRI with small acute
   infarcts although not enough to account for his altered mental status
   per neuro. His mental statis is much improved this morning compared to
   yesterday
   - appreciate neuro following
   - B12 low so repleting
   Strokes/atrial fibrillation
   - Aggrenox changed to plavix
   - start heparin gtt given PAF and strokes
   Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - continue lasix gtt to balance tube feed inputs with goal fluid
   balance even to slightly negative
   Hypertension:
   Remains hypertensive on regimen below, but will allow autoregulation in
   setting of acute infarcts.
   - Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10
   - increase PO labetolol to 800 TID
   Fever
   Now afebrile. Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased
   secretions.
   - treat for 8 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia (day 1 [**2173-4-11**])
   Anemia
   Hct stable. Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no evidence of
   end-organ ischemia.
   - recheck in am.
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN. Bumped recently likely from diuresis. And
   now improving

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient underwent clot evacuation and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, and his chest X-ray shows resolution of volume overload. He appears to have improved on vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's mental status has also improved, and he is now following commands.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including clopidogrel (plavix), high-dose aspirin, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril, furosemide (Lasix), and heparin. He is also being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient has a history of strokes/atrial fibrillation, acute systolic HF, hypertension, fever, anemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state from being in the ICU and receiving multiple medications"

   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , metoprolol, and lisinopril
   2. Respiratory Failure
   CXR shows resolution of volume overload. Less secretions. Appears to
   have improved on vanc/zosyn. Remains intubated given concern for mental
   status.
   - Pressure support trial

   - VAP: continue vanco/zosyn (day 1 of 8: [**2173-4-11**])
   3. Mental status change: EEG with diffuse slowing, MRI with small acute
   infarcts although not enough to account for his altered mental status
   per neuro.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient underwent evacuation of clot and POBA to the distal RCA. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, mental status change, hypertension, fever, acute systolic HF, anemia, acute kidney injury, h/o stroke, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient experienced a thrombosis in his stent, which required intervention. The cause of this thrombosis is unclear and may pose a risk for future thrombotic events.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to concerns about mental status changes. There is a need for continued monitoring and support of respiratory function.
3. Mental Status Change: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to various causes such as hypoxia, sepsis, or neurological issues. Further investigation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause and potential complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient has persistent hypertension despite medication. This may increase the risk of further cardiovascular events and requires careful management.
5. Fever: The patient has a fever likely related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate antibiotic therapy and infection control measures should be continued to prevent or treat this condition.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute congestive heart failure. He underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. The patient's thrombosis occurred four years after stent placement, and the cause is unclear. He is currently on multiple medications including clopidogrel, high-dose aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

The patient has also been diagnosed with respiratory failure, mental status changes, strokes/atrial fibrillation, acute systolic heart failure, hypertension, fever, anemia, and acute kidney injury. His condition has been improving over time, with improvements in mental status and resolution of volume overload on chest X-ray. The patient's recent events include unplanned extubation, invasive ventilation stop, and self-extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period. The recent increase in secretions and fever may indicate an infection, and the patient is being treated for VAP with antibiotics.
2. Stroke: The patient has a history of strokes and atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of future strokes.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of CVA, atrial fibrillation, anemia, delirium, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, and obesity. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and altered mental status, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to aspiration or impaired cough reflexes.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which may lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia, especially if proper hygiene and secretion clearance measures are not maintained.
4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at an increased risk of developing stress ulcers due to the body's stress response, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Delirium: The patient's pre-existing delirium could worsen during ICU stay due to various factors such as medication effects, sleep disturbances, or infections.
6. Worsening heart failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure may progress if not appropriately managed, leading to further respiratory compromise and fluid overload.
7. Hypertensive crisis: The"

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of CVA (stroke), atrial fibrillation, anemia, delirium, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and altered mental status. The patient presented to the ICU with an acute onset of altered mental status, confusion, delirium, respiratory failure, and malignant hypertension.

24-hour events include an unplanned extubation initiated by the patient, which was successfully managed. The patient's sodium levels improved after water flushes and the addition of D5W. The patient's Lantus dose was uptitrated to 48 U, and a PICC request was made. The patient received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 161/64 mmHg to 94/55 mmHg, heart rate between 55 and 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 86.1 kg at admission to 78.1 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,339 mL and output of 3,797 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,458 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot and
   POBA to distal RCA.
   STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , labetalol, and lisinopril
   Respiratory Failure
   Patient is s/p self-extubation on [**2173-4-17**] and has tolerated
   supplemental O2. Etiology likely related to fluid overload now much
   improved and pneumonia, now also improved on vancomycin and zosyn.
   - discontinue vanc / zosyn today to complete 8 day course (3/8-15/09)
   - discontinue lasix gtt
   - continue aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   Mental status change: Mental status is much improved s/p extubation.
   Etiology of altered mental status is likely related to prolonged
   hospitalization, multiple sedating medications related to intubation,
   infection given VAP, fluid overload, B12 deficiency, and multiple small
   acute infarcts as seen on MRI.
   - continue to follow-up EEG
   - continue B12 repleteion
   - appreciate neuro recs
   Strokes/atrial fibrillation
   - continue plavix
   - for anticoagulation, continue heparin gtt for now; once patient
   clinical status is more stable
   - consider starting warfarin tomorrow
   - for rate control, continue beta blocker
   Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - discontinue lasix gtt and transition to PO lasix
   - continue beta blocker and ACEI
   Hypertension:
   Remains hypertensive on regimen below, but will allow autoregulation in
   setting of acute infarcts.
   - Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine, beta blocker
   - add nitrate
   Fever
   Now afebrile. Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased
   secretions.
   - to complete 8 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia (day 1 [**2173-4-11**]
 Day 8 [**2173-4-18**])
   Anemia
   Hct stable. Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no evidence of
   end-organ ischemia.
   - continue to trend
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN. Bumped recently likely from diuresis. And
   now improving
    - continue trend

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA.

The patient has experienced several medical complications during his ICU stay. These include respiratory failure, mental status changes, strokes/atrial fibrillation, acute systolic heart failure, hypertension, fever, anemia, acute kidney injury, and diabetes.

The patient's respiratory failure was initially attributed to fluid overload and pneumonia. He was treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. The etiology of his altered mental status is multifactorial, including prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection (ventilator-associated pneumonia), fluid overload, vitamin B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI.

The patient has also had episodes of atrial fibrillation and strokes. He is being continued on clopidogrel (Plavix) and will be started on warfarin for anticoagulation. Rate control is being managed with a beta-blocker.

The patient's acute systolic heart failure is believed to be secondary to myocardial infarction and has improved with an ejection fraction of 50-55%. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic. He underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous oxygenation balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. The patient also had respiratory failure, mental status changes, strokes/atrial fibrillation, acute systolic HF, hypertension, fever, anemia, acute kidney injury, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient experienced a thrombosis in his stent, which required intervention. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this thrombosis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure, possibly due to fluid overload and pneumonia. He has been improved with supplemental O2 and antibiotics.
3. Mental Status Change: The patient had altered mental status likely related to prolonged hospitalization, sedating medications, infection (ventilator-associated pneumonia), fluid overload, B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts seen on MRI.
4. Strokes/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has had strokes and atrial fibrillation. He is currently on Plavix and will require anticoagulation with heparin and consideration of warfarin once stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/oM admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES
   and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot and
   POBA to distal RCA.
   STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what my have triggered this thrombosis 4 years after
   stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , labetalol, and lisinopril
   Respiratory Failure
   Patient is s/p self-extubation on [**2173-4-17**] and has tolerated
   supplemental O2. Etiology likely related to fluid overload now much
   improved and pneumonia, now also improved on vancomycin and zosyn.
   - discontinue vanc / zosyn today to complete 8 day course (3/8-15/09)
   - discontinue lasix gtt
   - continue aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   Mental status change: Mental status is much improved s/p extubation.
   Etiology of altered mental status is likely related to prolonged
   hospitalization, multiple sedating medications related to intubation,
   infection given VAP, fluid overload, B12 deficiency, and multiple small
   acute infarcts as seen on MRI.
   - continue to follow-up EEG
   - continue B12 repleteion
   - appreciate neuro recs
   Strokes/atrial fibrillation
   - continue plavix
   - for anticoagulation, continue heparin gtt for now; once patient
   clinical status is more stable
   - consider starting warfarin tomorrow
   - for rate control, continue beta blocker
   Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - discontinue lasix gtt and transition to PO lasix
   - continue beta blocker and ACEI
   Hypertension:
   Remains hypertensive on regimen below, but will allow autoregulation in
   setting of acute infarcts.
   - Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine, beta blocker
   - add nitrate
   Fever
   Now afebrile. Etiology appears likely related to VAP given increased
   secretions.
   - to complete 8 day course of vanc and zosyn for ventilator-associated
   pneumonia (day 1 [**2173-4-11**]
 Day 8 [**2173-4-18**])
   Anemia
   Hct stable. Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no evidence of
   end-organ ischemia.
   - continue to trend
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN. Bumped recently likely from diuresis. And
   now improving
    - continue trend
   Diabetes

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent evacuation of a clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. 

The patient's respiratory failure was initially attributed to fluid overload and pneumonia, for which he received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. His mental status has improved post-extubation, and the etiology of the altered mental status is likely related to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection (ventilator-associated pneumonia), fluid overload, vitamin B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts seen on MRI. 

The patient continues to have strokes and atrial fibrillation, for which he is on clopidogrel, heparin, and a beta-blocker. He also has acute systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50-55% and hypertension, which remains uncontrolled despite medication. His fever has resolved, and the etiology appears to be related to ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

The patient has anemia and acute kidney injury, both of which are improving. His diabetes is managed with glargine and insulin sliding scale. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male admitted with [**Year (4 digits) **] and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher
   DES and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot
   and POBA to distal RCA. Hospital course complicated by respiratory
   failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke now improved.
   Mental status change: Mental status continues to improve s/p
   extubation. Etiology of altered mental status is likely related to
   prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications related to
   intubation, infection given VAP, fluid overload, B12 deficiency, and
   multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI.
   - continue to follow-up EEG
   - continue B12 repleteion
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - S+S consult
   Respiratory Failure
   Patient is s/p self-extubation on [**2173-4-17**] and has tolerated
   supplemental O2. Etiology likely related to fluid overload now much
   improved and pneumonia. S/p 8 day course of vancomycin and pip/tazo
   ([**2079-4-20**]).
   - continue prn lasix 200mg IV with metolazone 5mg to aim for goal I/Os
   to be even
   - continue aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   [**Name (NI) **] / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what may have triggered this thrombosis 4 years
   after stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , labetalol, and lisinopril
   Strokes/atrial fibrillation
   - continue plavix
   - for anticoagulation, continue heparin gtt for now and transition to
   PO coumadin
   - for rate control, continue beta blocker
   Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - aim for goal I/Os to be even with prn lasix 200mg IV with metolazone
   5mg
   - continue beta blocker and ACEI
   Hypertension:
   Remains hypertensive on regimen but improved since starting imdur.
   - Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine, beta blocker, and imdur
   Leukocytosis
   Etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] has now completed VAP treatment and no
   additional symptoms.
   - send blood and urine cultures
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN. Creatinine has been in the range of 2.4-2.7.
   - continue to avoid nephrotoxic agents

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES and acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent percutaneous intervention with balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. Since then, the patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke, which have now improved.

The patient's mental status change is attributed to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications related to intubation, infection given ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fluid overload, B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI. The patient continues to follow-up with EEG, B12 repletion, and neuro recommendations.

The patient also has respiratory failure, likely related to fluid overload and pneumonia, which has improved after an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient will continue with aggressive suctioning, chest physical therapy, and even diuresis.

Regarding the in-stent thrombosis, it remains unclear what triggered this thrombosis 4 years after stent placement. The patient was managed with evacuation of clot and POBA to the distal RCA. The patient will continue on clopidogrel, high-dose aspirin, statin, labetalol, and lisinopril"

The plan is to continue prn lasix 200mg IV with metolazone 5mg to aim for goal I/Os to be even and continue aggressive suctioning and chest PT.

Regarding his in-stent thrombosis, it remains unclear what triggered this thrombosis 4 years after stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to distal RCA. The plan is to continue Plavix, high-dose aspirin, statin, labetalol, and lisinopril.

The patient also has a history of strokes/atrial fibrillation. The plan is to continue"

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES (drug-eluting stent). The patient underwent evacuation of a clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA (right coronary artery). 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- The patient is still hypertensive despite being on a regimen of medications including lisinopril, amlodipine, and a beta-blocker. Nitrate has been added to the regimen.
- The patient has shown improvement in respiratory failure, likely related to fluid overload and pneumonia. Antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) have been discontinued to complete an 8-day course.
- The patient's mental status has improved since extubation, and the etiology of altered mental status is likely related to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection (ventilator-associated pneumonia), fluid overload, vitamin B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI.
- The patient's acute systolic heart failure is now improving with an ejection fraction of 50-55%. Lasix gtt has been discontinued, and the patient is transitioning to PO (oral) lasix. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are being continued.
- The patient has a history of strokes and atrial fibrillation, for which Plavix and anticoagulation (heparin gtt) have been continued. Warfarin therapy is planned once the patient's clinical status stabilizes, and beta-blockers are being used for rate control.
- The patient's acute kidney injury is improving, likely initially from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and recently bumped likely from diuresis.
- The patient's diabetes is being managed with glargine and ISS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient remains hypertensive despite medication adjustments, which can lead to complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or cardiac complications if left uncontrolled.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk of recurrent pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
3. Stroke: The patient has a history of strokes, and the continued use of Plavix and anticoagulation may help reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. However, the patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension increase the risk of future cerebrovascular events.
4. Acute kidney injury: Although the patient's kidney function is improving, there is still a risk of worsening renal function or the development of chronic kidney disease.
5. Diabetic complications: The patient's diabetes needs to be closely monitored for complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a history of STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute congestive heart failure. The patient underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was given medications such as Plavix, aspirin, statin, labetalol, and lisinopril. 

During his hospital course, the patient developed respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke. He was intubated and received mechanical ventilation. The patient also had episodes of self-extubation and required repeated suctioning. 

He had a positive blood culture for VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), for which he received an appropriate antibiotic regimen. 

The patient experienced mental status changes, which are believed to be multifactorial due to prolonged hospitalization, sedating medications, infection, fluid overload, B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts seen on MRI. 

He underwent an MRI of the brain, which revealed multiple small acute infarcts. The patient's renal function worsened, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), initially thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but subsequent urine eosinophil testing indicated allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). 

The patient's hypertension was difficult to control despite multiple antihypertensive medications. His diabetes required adjustment of insulin therapy. 

The patient's condition improved gradually, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. Since admission, the patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke, which are now improving.

The patient has been hypertensive despite multimeds, but has shown improvement since starting imdur. The plan is to continue lisinopril, amlodipine, labetalol, and imdur, and to uptitrate imdur as needed for improved control. The patient's urine metanephrines will be followed up.

The patient has also experienced acute kidney injury (AKI), initially thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) but now suggested to be allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to the presence of eosinophils in the urine and the discontinuation of antibiotics. The patient's creatinine has been fluctuating between 2.4-2.7, with a peak of 3.3. Renal consultation will be sought if creatinine continues to worsen. ACE inhibitors will be held for now.

Leukocytosis is still present, but its et"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher drug-eluting stent (DES), as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to ischemic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA.

The patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke. The patient's mental status has improved since extubation, and the etiology of altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection given ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fluid overload, vitamin B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI.

The patient passed speech and swallow evaluations and is currently following up with EEG. The patient is also being repleted with vitamin B12 and receiving neurologic recommendations.

Regarding respiratory failure, the patient self-extubated on [**2173-4-17**] but tolerated supplemental oxygen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his coronary artery stent. He also had acute congestive heart failure, which was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the distal RCA. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke. He is currently improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication, indicating uncontrolled hypertension.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has developed acute kidney injury, likely initially from acute tubular necrosis but now positive for allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to antibiotics. His creatinine levels are elevated.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, but the etiology is unclear.
4. Mental Status Change: The patient has experienced altered mental status, which is improving after extubation. The cause is multifactorial, including prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection (ventilator-associated pneumonia), fluid overload, vitamin B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts seen on MRI.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure, likely due to fluid overload and pneumonia. He was treated with antibiotics and is now tolerating supplemental oxygen.
6. STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis: The patient experienced a"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES. The hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke, but is now improving. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including hypertension, acute kidney injury (AIN), leukocytosis, mental status change, respiratory failure, post-myocardial infarction syndrome, strokes/atrial fibrillation, acute systolic heart failure, diabetes, anemia, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The assessment and plan section of the note outlines the following:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication. It is recommended to continue the current antihypertensive regimen and consider uptitrating Imur as needed for improved control.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AIN): The patient likely has AIN due to antibiotics, which have been discontinued. The creatinine level is worsening, and it is advised to examine urine casts, continue avoiding nephrotoxic agents, and seek a renal consult if creatinine continues to worsen.

3. Leukocytosis: The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, and follow-up blood and urine cultures are recommended.

4. Mental status change: The patient's mental status continues to improve after extubation. The etiology is likely multifactorial and includes prolonged hospital"

   62 yo male admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher
   DES and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot
   and POBA to distal RCA. Hospital course complicated by respiratory
   failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke now improving.
   Hypertension: BP labile and high despite multimeds.
   Remains hypertensive on regimen but improved since starting imdur.
   -Cont lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine, labetolol, and imdur
   -can continue to uptitrate imdur as needed for improved control
   -will f/u urine metanephrines
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN but urine eos positive suggesting AIN.  He is
   now off antibiotics which were likely to be contributing to AIN. Also
   with worsening in setting of lasix diuresis pre-renal azotemia is
   positive. Creatinine has been in the range of 2.4-2.7. Up to 3.3 today.
   -exam urine casts
   -continue to avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Renal consult tomorrow if creatinine continues to worsen.
   - hold ACE for now
   Leukocytosis
   Etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] has now completed VAP treatment and no
   additional symptoms.
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   Mental status change: Mental status continues to improve s/p
   extubation. Etiology of altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   related to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications
   related to intubation, infection given VAP, fluid overload, B12
   deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI.  Passed
   speech and swallow
   - continue to follow-up EEG
   - continue B12 repleteion
   - appreciate neuro recs
   Respiratory Failure
   Patient is s/p self-extubation on [**2173-4-17**] and has tolerated
   supplemental O2. Etiology likely related to fluid overload now much
   improved and pneumonia. S/p 8 day course of vancomycin and pip/tazo
   ([**2079-4-10**]).
   - continue as needed lasix 200mg IV with metolazone 5mg to aim for goal
   I/Os to be even
   - continue aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what may have triggered this thrombosis 4 years
   after stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , labetalol, and lisinopril
   and imdur
   Strokes/atrial fibrillation
   - continue plavix
   - for anticoagulation, continue heparin gtt with bridge to PO coumadin,
   INR 1.5 today
   - for rate control, continue beta blocker
   Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - aim for goal I/Os to be even with prn lasix 200mg IV with metolazone
   5mg
   - continue beta blocker and ACEI
   Diabetes
   - Cont to uptitrate glargine to improve control and less need for ISS
   - discontinuing tube feeds today
   Anemia
   Hct stable. Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no evidence of
   end-organ ischemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES. He also had acute congestive heart failure (CHF), which is now improving. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still high despite being on multiple medications. However, it has improved since starting imdur.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AIN): The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated, ranging from 2.4-2.7, with a recent peak of 3.3. The diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is suggested by urine eosinophils. Antibiotics were likely contributing to AIN, so they have been discontinued. Further evaluation, such as urine casts, will be done. Renal consult is planned for tomorrow if creatinine continues to worsen. ACE inhibitors should be avoided for now.
3. Leukocytosis: The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear. VAP treatment has been completed, and no additional symptoms are present. Follow-up blood and urine cultures will be done.
4. Mental status change: The patient's mental status continues to improve after extubation. The etiology of altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating"

   additional symptoms.
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   Mental status change: Mental status continues to improve s/p
   extubation. Etiology of altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   related to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications
   related to intubation, infection given VAP, fluid overload, B12
   deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI.  Passed
   speech and swallow
   - continue to follow-up EEG

","The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a history of STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure likely ischemic/diastolic. He underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. The hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke, which are now improving.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention. These include:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile and high despite being on multiple medications. It has improved since starting imdur.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient likely initially had acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but urine eosinophils (eos) are positive, suggesting allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient is now off antibiotics, which were likely contributing to AIN. His creatinine levels have been in the range of 2.4-2.7, and today's value is 3.9. Renal consultation is recommended, and ACE inhibitors should be held for now, along with oral lasix. A renal ultrasound should be followed up.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated but trending down. The etiology is unclear. It may be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but since VAP treatment is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute CHF. The hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke. The patient's current condition includes hypertension, acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, mental status change, respiratory failure, and a history of STEMI/in-stent thrombosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and on various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile and high despite being on multiple medications. There is a need for improved control, and the plan is to continue amlodipine, labetalol, and imdur. The hypertension should be closely monitored to prevent any further complications.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AIN): The patient has a positive urine eosinophil test, suggesting acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The antibiotics were likely contributing to AIN, and the patient is now off antibiotics. The creatinine levels have been increasing, ranging from 2.4-2.7, with a recent value of 3.9. Renal casts should be examined, nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and a renal consult is needed. Holding ACE inhibitors and PO lasix is advised.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated but trending down. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute CHF. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile and high despite medication. It has improved since starting imdur.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient likely initially had acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but urine eosinophils are positive suggesting allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient is now off antibiotics, which were likely contributing to AIN. Creatinine levels have been in the range of 2.4-2.7 and are up to 3.9 today.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is down trending, but the etiology is unclear. The patient has completed treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and shows no additional symptoms.

4. Mental status change: The patient's mental status continues to improve since extubation. The etiology of the altered mental status is likely multifactorial, related to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection given VAP, fluid overload, B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts seen on MRI.

   ([**2079-4-10**]).
   - continue aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what may have triggered this thrombosis 4 years
   after stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure. The patient underwent evacuation of a clot and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. The hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke. The patient's hypertension remains uncontrolled despite multimeds but has improved since starting imdur. The patient also has acute kidney injury likely from initially acute tubular necrosis (ATN) but with a positive urine eosinophil (eos) suggesting allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing and are now at 3.9. The patient has leukocytosis that is downtrending, and the etiology is unclear. The patient's mental status has improved after extubation and is likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection given ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fluid overload, vitamin B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI. The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to fluid overload and pneumonia. The patient's STEMI/in-stent thrombosis remains unclear and was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to the distal RCA.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   - No complaints except pain at Foley site today
   - Renal U/S yesterday - kidneys normal in size, but has a ?bladder
   filling defect
   - slightly hypotensive and oliguric this morning
   - creatinine appears to have peaked at 4.1, now 3.9.  HCT 25%
   - urine eos persistently (+)
   Physical Examination
   JVP <7 at 30 deg
   syst murmur of MR
   no edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Imp:
   - CAD, s/p MI
   - pneumonia, resolved
   - renal failure
   - hypovolemia
   Plan:
   - 1 unit PRBC
   - liberalize PO intake
   - hold off warfarin for now in case procedures needed
   - urology consultation
   CCU care required because of hemodynamic instability, advanced renal
   failure

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, along with acute congestive heart failure. The patient underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. The hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke, which are now improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has experienced an unclear cause of acute kidney injury, possibly dry (Feurea 35) vs. acute interstitial nephritis from Zosyn. Creatinine peaked at 4.1 but is still making urine. Renal dosing of medications should be considered.
2. Bladder wall filling defect: A bladder wall filling defect was noted on renal US, and a urology consult is pending for further evaluation, possibly cystoscopy.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is actually low today, and antihypertensive medications like Imur may need to be stopped, while continuing labetalol.
4. Leukocytosis: The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, and follow-up blood and urine cultures should be done after completing VAP treatment.
5. Mental status change: The mental status change appears to have resolved, likely due to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection, fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, as well as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) likely ischemic/diastolic. The patient underwent evacuation of a clot and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. 

Since admission, the patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke, which are now improving. The patient has also developed acute kidney injury (AKI), possibly due to dry mouth or adverse effects of the antibiotic Zosyn. 

Further evaluation is needed for a bladder wall filling defect observed on renal ultrasound. The patient's hypertension has improved, and adjustments have been made to his antihypertensive medications. Leukocytosis is down-trending, and an etiology is unclear. The patient has completed treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is asymptomatic. 

Mental status changes have resolved, likely due to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications, infection, fluid overload, vitamin B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts seen on MRI. 

The patient previously experienced respiratory failure, but this has improved with aggressive suctioning, chest physical therapy, and weaning off supplemental oxygen. 

The patient remains on dual antiplatelet therapy with Plavix and aspirin, as"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male admitted with STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher
   DES and acute CHF likely ischemic/diastolic now s/p evacuation of clot
   and POBA to distal RCA. Hospital course complicated by respiratory
   failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke now improving.
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely initially from ATN but urine eos positive suggesting AIN or
   cholesterol emboli. Also with low FEurea, possibly suggesting prerenal
   from overdiuresis. He is now off antibiotics which were likely to be
   contributing to AIN. Peak creatinine yest at 4.1, now 3.9. Developed
   mild AG metabolic acidosis, perhaps from uremia. Renal consulted
   yesterday.
   - Will hold diuretics and IVF and allow patient to take in POs as
   tolerated.
   - continue to avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - hold ACE for now
   - F/u C3, C4
   Bladder wall filling defect
   Noted on renal US and rads recommended urology consult.
   - Urology consult pending for further eval, possible cystoscopy
   (although may be difficult given anticoagulation).
   Hypertension: BP better controlled overnight.
   -Cont to hold  lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **], as above
   -continue amlodipine, labetolol, and imdur
   -will f/u urine metanephrines
   Leukocytosis Downtrending, etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] has now completed
   VAP treatment and no additional symptoms.
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   Mental status change: Appears to have resolved. Likely was from
   prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications related to
   intubation, infection given VAP, fluid overload, B12 deficiency, and
   multiple small acute infarcts as seen on MRI.  Perhaps also from uremia
   given renal failure.
   - continue B12 repleteion
   - appreciate neuro recs
   Respiratory Failure
   Patient is s/p self-extubation on [**2173-4-17**] and has tolerated
   supplemental O2. Etiology likely related to fluid overload now much
   improved and pneumonia. S/p 8 day course of vancomycin and pip/tazo
   ([**2079-4-10**]).
   - continue aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   STEMI / In-Stent Thrombosis:
   It remains unclear what may have triggered this thrombosis 4 years
   after stent placement. He was managed by evacuation of clot and POBA to
   distal RCA.
   - Cont plavix , high dose aspirin, statin , labetalol, and lisinopril
   and imdur
   Strokes/atrial fibrillation-currently sinus and rate controlled
   - continue plavix
   - for anticoagulation, continue heparin gtt
   -d/c coumadin in case further procedures are needed
   - for rate control, continue labetolol
   Acute Systolic HF
   Echo showed new systolic dysfunction s/p IMI, now improved with EF
   50-55%.
   - aim for goal I/Os to be even
   -holding PO lasix
   - continue beta blocker but holding ACEI for renal failure
   Bladder filling defect: concern for mass/malignancy.
   -          f/u urology recs
   -          urine cytology
   Diabetes
   - Cont to uptitrate glargine, now on 50U to improve control and less
   need for ISS
   - eating diabetic diet
   Anemia
   Hct stable. Threshold for transfusion is under 21 given no evidence of
   end-organ ischemia.
   - continue to trend

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 62-year-old male, was admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES, followed by acute CHF. He underwent evacuation of clot and percutaneous orbital athectomy (POBA) to the distal RCA.
- The hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke, which are now improving.
- The patient developed acute kidney injury, initially thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but further evaluation suggests the possibility of allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) or cholesterol emboli. Low FEurea levels indicate the possibility of prerenal azotemia from overdiuresis.
- The patient's peak creatinine level was 4.1, and it has now improved to 3.9. He also developed a mild anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to uremia.
- Renal consultation recommended holding diuretics and intravenous fluids, allowing the patient to take in oral fluids as tolerated. They also advised continuing to avoid nephrotoxic agents and monitoring C3 and C4 levels.
- A bladder wall filling defect was noted on renal ultrasound, and the radiologist recommended a urology consult.
- The patient's hypertension is better controlled overnight, and lisinopril has been held. The current antihypertensive regimen includes amlodipine, labetalol"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, leukocytosis, impaired muscle performance, atrial fibrillation, other anemia, malignant hypertension, acute diastolic heart failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes a recent arterial line stop, renal consultation, and urology consultation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 131/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications. The patient's weight is currently 75.8 kg, down from 86.1 kg at admission.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are progressively increasing, indicating worsening renal function. Glucose levels are within normal range. Electrolyte imbalances are present with low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not available.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other systems. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher DES. He also presented with acute congestive heart failure, which is likely ischemic or diastolic in nature. The patient underwent clot evacuation and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. His hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, and stroke, but he is now improving.

The patient's current medical issues include acute kidney injury with unclear cause, possibly due to dehydration or acute interstitial nephritis from Zosyn. His creatinine level peaked at 4.1 but is still producing urine. The patient's bladder wall filling defect was noted on renal ultrasound, and a urology consult has been recommended for further evaluation, possibly including cystoscopy.

The patient's hypertension is being managed by stopping Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) and continuing labetalol. His leukocytosis is downtrending, and the etiology is unclear. The patient's mental status change appears to have resolved, likely due to prolonged hospitalization, multiple sedating medications related to intubation, infection given ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fluid overload, vitamin B12 deficiency, and multiple small acute infarcts seen on MRI.

The patient's respiratory failure is thought to be caused by fluid overload and pneumonia. He underwent"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) and in-stent thrombosis of his Cypher stent. He underwent clot evacuation and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the distal RCA. The hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, stroke, and acute kidney injury (ARF).

The patient's current condition includes:
- Acute Kidney Injury: The cause is unclear, but it may be due to dehydration (Feurea) or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) from Zosyn. Creatinine levels are improving, and the patient is still making urine. Diuretics have been held, as well as medications that are contraindicated in renal impairment. Renal dosing of medications has been initiated, and a renal follow-up has been scheduled.
- Bladder wall filling defect: This was noted on renal US, and a urology consult has been recommended. The patient will follow up with an outpatient urology consult.
- Hypertension: The patient will continue on labetalol and amlodipine. Metanephrines are high, likely due to a stress reaction.
- Respiratory Failure: The patient self-extubated on [**2173-4-17**]. Further respiratory support is required.
