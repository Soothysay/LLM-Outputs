   Transfered from TICU, L IJ placed before transfer.  Post-placement XR
   showed catheter tip against far right edge of SVC, catheter was
   withdrawn 2 cm.
   Code status discussed with family, decided full code.  Also, the
   patient's two sons deny that he has been drinking at all for the past
   year.  They do not live with him and they report that he tends to hide
   his medical problems, but they insist that he has not been drinking
   over the past year.
   Overnight he was on stable vent settings, stable vitals weaned off
   Levophed by 3 am.  However, he continued to have decreased hematocrits
   despite transfusions.  Initial Hct on MICU arrival was 25, following 1
   unit PRBC it actually decreased to 22.  Then after another 3 units it
   increased again to 25.  2 more units PRBC were ordered.   Small amount
   of old blood seen on lactulose enema overnight, but no other visible
   evidence of active bleeding.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9234**] is a 73 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for MELD
   21 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and varices, EtOH
   abuse, HTN, and recent MVA admitted for hematemesis now transferred to
   the MICU for hypotension, ARF, and leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hematemesis/anemia: Possible variceal bleed given EGD with grade 3
   varices now s/p banding.  Also could be [**3-5**] duodenal ulcer, or other
   intraabdominal injury s/p MVA.   Persistent anemia could also be
   secondary to hemolysis, although labs may be difficult to interpret in
   the setting of significant transfusion.
   - Continue to watch closely for signs of worsening bleed
 especially
   variceal.
   - Trend hct Q6H, transfuse as needed to keep Hct above 25 . Correct
   coagulopathy as needed.
   - Platelets remain low, will follow closely.
   - Continue PPI IV BID per liver
   - Pip/tazo/cipro for possible SBP
   - Follow-up liver recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential at this time includes bleeding as above,
   liver disease, possible SIRS/sepsis.  Cardiogenic shock unlikely given
   TTE performed today with preserved LVEF.  Potential sources of
   infection include aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis or SBP.  Lactate
   continues to trend down.  UA negative, CXR with small LLL consildation
   in setting of hematemesis likely representing aspiration.  Now
   significantly fluid positive, off pressors, hemodynamically stable
   currently.
   - Monitor hemodynamics, maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr, CVP>12,
   ScVO2>70. Trend lactate.
   - Vancomycin, pip/tazo, and cipro given unclear source of infection.
   - Pan-culture including BCx x2, sputum culture. Will consider
   ultrasound abdomen and perform diagnostic paracentesis today.
   - Trend hct as above.
   - Active T+S, crossmatch.
   - Attempt to wean sedation today.
   - check with surgery for advice on possible imaging to assess question
   of intra-abdominal bleeding
   - check bladder pressure.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process with potential
   sources including SBP or aspiration pneumonia versus chemical
   pneumonitis.  Alternatively, this may be reactive in setting of
   variceal bleed.
   - Trend fever curve and WBC.
   - Empiric antimicrobials as above with pan-culture.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient intubated for airway protection at OSH.
   Ventilating and oxygenating well.
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with adjustments based on ABG.
   - Can consider extubation when patient stabilizes hemodyanmically.
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 21 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by
   varices and encephalopathy. Transaminases mildly elevated, although
   elevated INR and low albumin suggest decreased synthetic function.
   Patient also has worsening hyperbilirubinemia acutely (likely also
   influenced by transfustions).
   - Lactulose PR until able to place OGT. Will start rifaxamin when OGT
   in place.
   - Follow-up liver recs
   - Follow-up viral hepatitis serologies
   - Hold on OGT x4 days per liver given esophageal banding.
   - Trend LFTs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: creatinine improving, will continue to follow.
   - Monitor UOP with goal UOP>30 cc/hr
   - Midodrine, octreotide, and albumin for possible HRS
   - Trend creatinine and electrolytes.
   .
   # CV: Patient with ECG on admission without acute ST-T wave changes
   suggestive of ischemia. Cardiac biomarkers flat, will continue to
   monitor.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of MELD 21 alcoholic cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy and varices. He also has hypertension and was recently involved in a motor vehicle accident.
- The patient presented to the hospital with hematemesis and is now in the ICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis.
- Possible causes of the hematemesis include variceal bleed, duodenal ulcer, or other intra-abdominal injury from the MVA. Anemia could also be secondary to hemolysis.
- The patient's hypotension may be due to bleeding, liver disease, or possible SIRS/sepsis.
- The patient has been receiving various treatments including PPI IV, antibiotics for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and diagnostic paracentesis.
- The patient's respiratory status is stable while on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's liver disease is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin.
- The patient's acute renal failure is improving, and fluid management is being closely monitored.
- Cardiac function appears to be normal based on the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
- The patient's electrolytes and other lab results are being trended regularly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleed: The patient has a history of esophageal varices, which can lead to bleeding"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9234**] is a 73 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for MELD
   21 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and varices, EtOH
   abuse, HTN, and recent MVA admitted for hematemesis now transferred to
   the MICU for hypotension, ARF, and leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential at this time includes SIRS/sepsis in
   setting of leukocytosis and vasopressor requirement, ESLD with
   signifcant peripheral/splachnic vasodilation, and hypovolemia either
   from bleeding or third-spacing in setting of recent MVA.  Cardiogenic
   shock unlikely given TTE performed today with preserved LVEF.
   Potential sources of infection include aspiration pneumonia vs.
   pneumonitis or SBP.  Lactate rising trending down from 5.7 to 4.4,
   although levels difficult to interpret in setting of liver disease.  UA
   negative, CXR with small LLL consildation in setting of hematemesis
   likely representing aspiration.
   - Monitor hemodynamics, maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr, CVP>12,
   ScVO2>70. Trend lactate.
   - IVF bolus, colloid/blood products, and norepinephrine as necessary to
   maintain hemodynamic goals
   - Vancomycin, pip/tazo, and cipro given unclear source of infection.
   - Pan-culture including BCx x2, sputum culture. Will ultrasound abdomen
   and perform diagnostic paracentesis if possible.
   - Trend hct Q8H, transfuse to maintain hct<21, active hemorrhage, or
   end organ perfusion.
   - Active T+S, crossmatch for 2units PRBC.
   - Switch sedation from propafol to fent/midaz
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process with potential
   sources including SBP or aspiration pneumonia versus chemical
   pneumonitis.  Alternatively, this may be reactive in setting of
   variceal bleed.
   - Trend fever curve and WBC.
   - Empiric antimicrobials as above with pan-culture.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient intubated for airway protection at OSH.
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with adjustments based on ABG.
   - Can consider extubation when patient stabilizes hemodyanmically.
   .
   # Hematemesis/anemia: Likely variceal bleed given EGD with grade 3
   varices now s/p banding.
   - Trend hct Q6H, transfuse as above. If patient rebleeds, will correct
   coagulopathy with goal INR<1.5.
   - Continue PPI IV BID per liver
   - Pip/tazo for SBP prophylaxis
   - Follow-up liver recs if any
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 21 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by
   varices and encephalopathy. Transaminases mildly elevated, although
   elevated INR and low albumin suggest decreased synthetic function.
   Patient also has worsening hyperbilirubinemia in acute setting.
   - Lactulose PR until able to place OGT. Will start rifaxamin when OGT
   in place.
   - Abdominal u/s with dopplers
   - Follow-up liver recs
   - Follow-up viral hepatitis serologies
   - Hold on OGT x4 days per liver given esophageal banding.
   - Pip/tazo for SBP prophylaxis.
   - Trend LFTs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear baseline creatinine, although creatinine
   at OSH on [**9-8**] was 1.1 ([**1-8**] 0.9) suggesting acute renal failure.
   Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN in setting of
   hypotension, and HRS.  Creatinine has trended down from peak of 2.5 on
   admission to 1.9 today.
   - Check urine lytes, sediment, and eos
   - Monitor UOP with goal UOP>30 cc/hr
   - Midodrine, octreotide, and albumin for possible HRS
   - Trend creatinine and electrolytes.
   .
   # EtOH: Currently on midazolam for sedation. Will plan on adding ativan
   per CIWA scale when extubated.
   - Thiamine, folate, and MVI.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to sequestration in setting of
   liver disease and portal hypertension.  Platelets on [**9-8**] 71, [**1-8**] 52
   - Trend platelets.
   .
   # CV: Patient with ECG on admission without acute ST-T wave changes
   suggestive of ischemia. Cardiac biomarkers during admission with
   elevated CK in 400s with flat MB (CK 578 on [**1-8**]) but with rising TnT
   0.08->0.19 suggesting demand ischemia and/or impaired clearance in
   setting of ARF.
   - Trend TnT, repeat ECG.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver disease, hypertension, and recent motor vehicle accident (MVA). He was admitted for hematemesis and is now in the MICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, airway protection issues, acute renal failure, alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal bleed, and potential sources of infection such as aspiration pneumonia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation.

The assessment and plan include monitoring hemodynamics, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65, urine output (UOP) > 30 cc/hr, central venous pressure (CVP) > 12, and systemic vascular oxygen saturation (ScVO2) > 70. The patient is also receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and norepinephrine to maintain hemodynamic goals, as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting culture results. Blood products are being transfused as needed, and a diagnostic paracentesis is planned if possible. Sedation is being switched from propofol to fentanyl and midazolam.

Leukocytosis is concerning for an infectious process, possibly SBP or aspiration pneumonia, or it may be reactive due to variceal bleeding. Respiratory management includes volume-cycled assist control ventilation with adjustments based on arterial blood"

   2.       Anemia: Received 6 U PRBC since last PM and HCT only 25- even
   if some was dilutional given massive resuscitation it is still
   concerning for active ongoing blood loss. Sources could be oozing

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and shock, concerning for evolving sepsis. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise:

1. Shock: The patient initially presented with hemorrhagic shock, but there is concern for evolving sepsis due to worsening hypotension, rising white blood cell count (WBC), and stable hematocrit (HCT) despite aggressive resuscitation. Sepsis may be caused by pneumonia or peritonitis.

2. Anemia: The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since the last day, but the HCT remains low. This is concerning for ongoing blood loss from sources such as oozing varices or ulcers.

3. GI bleed: The patient underwent banding for variceal bleeding, and access should be maintained for serial HCT monitoring. The INR should be kept less than 1.5, and Cipro prophylaxis should be continued. Consultation with the gastroenterology team is recommended for further management, including the possibility of endoscopy.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently requiring full ventilatory support due to shock. The rate can be adjusted as needed. Weaning off ventilatory support may be considered once the patient's condition stabilizes.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function may be"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of variceal bleed and cirrhosis. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient requires more blood over night, indicating ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and liver disease, including cirrhosis. They also have multiple comorbidities such as renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are unstable with hypotension and altered mental status. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and evidence of liver dysfunction. The patient's arterial blood gas reveals respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates poor perfusion and may lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which could be due to hypotension or direct liver injury.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of variceal bleeding and ongoing blood requirement suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory compromise. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to high peak inspiratory pressures.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As a result of liver cirrhosis, the patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is variceal bleed and cirrhosis. 

The patient requires more blood over night, indicating ongoing bleeding or other causes of hemodynamic instability. They have been intubated and sedated, suggesting respiratory distress or failure requiring mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension (low blood pressure) and tachycardia (elevated heart rate). Their oxygen saturation is within normal range at 98%. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which is a chronic liver disease that can lead to complications such as portal hypertension and increased risk of variceal bleeding.

The patient's flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid administration and output, indicating the need for careful fluid balance management in critically ill patients. The patient's respiratory support indicates the use of endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation with settings including controlled mode ventilation (CMV) and assist/autoflow modes.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), indicating possible infection or coagulopathy. Liver function tests reveal elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), while kidney function tests show signs of acute renal failure (elevated creatinine and BUN levels). Electrolyte imbalances are present, particularly low potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-).

   1.       Shock: DDX was initially hemmorhagic but now seems evolving
   sepsis is likely given worsening hypotension with rising WBC and stable
   HCT in face of  aggressive resuscitation- dount cardiac given warm and
   normal echo and SCVo2.
   For Sepsis: sourced would be PNA, peritonitis
 not enough to tap based
   on imaging, Vanco Zosyn CIpro empiric and pan culture
   Keep CVP 8-12, SCVO2 was in good range in 80
s, using albumin challenge
   per Liver and can also use blood
   Hemorrhage- trend serial HCT. Cardiac
 trend SCVO2
   2.       Anemia: get 6 U PRBC since last PM and HCT on;y 25- even if
   some was dilutional gven massive resuscitation it is still concerning
   for active ongoing blood loss.
                  GI bleed: s/p banding, , maintain access and serial HCT,
   keep inr less than 1.5 Cipro prophylaxis
                   Check hemolysis labs
                   Consider repeat imaging
   3.       Resp Failure: in setting of shock, currently requiring full

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and shock. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient has been experiencing worsening hypotension despite aggressive resuscitation. This could be due to evolving sepsis, as indicated by the rising white blood cell count and stable hematocrit. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt management.

2. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): The patient is intubated and sedated, which increases the risk of aspiration. Regular assessment of the airway and consideration of extubation when appropriate should be considered.

3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient has evidence of renal dysfunction, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including fluid and electrolyte balance, are necessary.

4. Cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which increases the risk of hepatic complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and portal hypertension. Monitoring liver function tests and implementing appropriate interventions to prevent further liver damage is important.

5. Gastrointestinal bleed, other (GI bleed, GIB): The patient has an ongoing"

The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and shock, concerning for evolving sepsis. He has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to ongoing blood loss and is currently on mechanical ventilation support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is maintained between 8-12 mmHg, and he is off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's initial diagnosis was hemorrhagic shock, but there is now concern for evolving sepsis due to worsening hypotension and rising white blood cell count (WBC) despite aggressive resuscitation. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and the source of infection is being investigated.
2. Anemia: The patient has received 6 units of PRBCs since the previous day, but his hematocrit (HCT) is still low at 25%. This is concerning for ongoing active blood loss, possibly from oozing varices or an ulcer. The role of a repeat endoscopy should be discussed with gastroenterology.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires full ventilatory support,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history significant for MELD 21 EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, varices, EtOH abuse, HTN, and recent MVA. He was admitted for hematemesis and now transferred to the MICU for hypotension, ARF, and leukocytosis.

The patient has shown several potential medical complications:

1. Hematemesis/anemia: The patient has experienced hematemesis, which is vomiting of blood. The etiology is unknown, but it could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) or extraluminal/retroperitoneal bleeding. The patient has undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding of grade 3 varices, which are dilated blood vessels in the esophagus commonly seen in cirrhosis patients. The Hct (hematocrit) has been stable over the last day, indicating no active bleeding at the moment.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires levophed, a medication used to increase blood pressure. The cause of hypotension is likely distributive shock (liver vs SIRS/sepsis) or hypovolemia. Bladder pressures are stable, ruling out abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient's preserved EF (ejection fraction) suggests good heart function.

3. Leukocyt"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of MELD 21 EtOH cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy and varices, EtOH abuse, HTN, and recent MVA. He was admitted for hematemesis and is now in the MICU for hypotension, ARF, and leukocytosis.

24-hour events include a trend of decreasing blood pressure, administration of levophed and 50g albumin, stable Hct and INR, stable bladder pressure, and no plans for liver scope until signs of active bleeding. The patient had a femoral triple lumen catheter removed. No known drug allergies were reported.

Infusions include midazolam, octreotide, and fentanyl. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/44 to 90/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 23 mmHg, bladder pressure of 19 mmHg, and fluid balance with a total input of 4,773 mL, total output of 1,375 mL, and urine output of 1,375 mL.

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, encephalopathy, and varices. He was admitted for hematemesis and is now in the MICU for hypotension, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and leukocytosis. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. Proper hand hygiene, oral care, and lung exercise should be performed to prevent VAP. Weaning of sedation and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be considered if tolerated.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of encephalopathy related to his cirrhosis. Lactulose therapy should be continued to manage this condition.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presented with hematemesis and may have a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) secondary to variceal bleeding. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion should be done as indicated. Continued use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is recommended.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has evidence of AKI with elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output (UOP) and fluid balance is important. Goal-directed fluid therapy and diures if necessary should be considered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and shock. There are concerns about evolving sepsis, as indicated by worsening hypotension with rising white blood cell (WBC) count despite aggressive resuscitation. The patient's condition includes pneumonia, aspiration, hypotension (not in shock), renal failure (acute), cirrhosis of the liver (alcoholic), and gastrointestinal bleed (other).

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Shock: The patient is currently experiencing shock, which is characterized by inadequate blood flow to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not promptly treated.

2. Sepsis: The patient's worsening hypotension, rising WBC count, and symptoms suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on various factors, including the patient's mental status and ability to protect their airway.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). This could be due to pre-renal causes such as dehydration or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with a chief complaint of shock, gastrointestinal bleed, and cirrhosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving multiple interventions to stabilize his condition. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving octreotide, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions. He is also receiving antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/50 to 138/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 of 40%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 4,773 mL and output of 1,375 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,398 mL. His central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 23 mmHg. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 238, suggesting adequate oxygenation and ventilation. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 6.8 to 7.3 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.9 g/dL, and decreased platelet count of 36-40 K/uL. Liver function tests reveal elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), increased total bilirubin (T Bili), and decreased albumin level of 2.5 g/dL. Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure (ARF) with elevated serum creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, aspiration, hypotension (not in shock), altered mental status, acute renal failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's airway is at risk for aspiration due to altered gag reflex and cough. 

ICU care includes ongoing respiratory support, glycemic control, central venous and arterial line monitoring, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's sons have been informed of his condition, and he will continue to be managed in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with a chief complaint of shock, GI bleed, and cirrhosis. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 109/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been receiving various medications including octreotide, fentanyl, midazolam, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to being intubated and sedated, which increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which may indicate ongoing shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Airway Compromise: The patient's inability to protect his airway poses a risk for further aspiration and potential respiratory compromise.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible acute renal failure.
5. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleed increases the risk of rebleeding or ongoing blood loss.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and shock, concerning for evolving sepsis. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, aspiration, acute renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration), altered gag reflex, and altered airway clearance. The patient is intubated and sedated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with hemorrhagic shock but now there is concern for evolving sepsis, which is likely given worsening hypotension with rising white blood cell count (WBC) and stable hematocrit (HCT) despite aggressive resuscitation.
2. Anemia: The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, and measures should be taken to maintain access for serial HCT and keep INR less than 1.5. Ciprofloxacin prophylaxis should be continued.
3. Respiratory Failure: In the setting of shock, the patient is able to wean off ventilator support using pressure support ventilation (PSV). However, mental status and sedation remain major barriers to extubation.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): ARF could be pre-renal in origin due to shock, but it is less likely to be hepatorenal given the patient's response to resuscitation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, encephalopathy, varices, hypertension, and recent motor vehicle accident. He was admitted for hematemesis and is now in the ICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from variceal bleeding, and is undergoing banding. His blood pressure is stable with the use of vasopressors, and his lactate levels are trending down. There are concerns about an infectious process, possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's cirrhosis is worsening, with elevated liver enzymes and decreased albumin levels. He also has acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels are improving. The patient's cardiovascular status appears stable without any acute changes on the ECG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his own airway increases the risk of aspiration, leading to pneumonia.
2. Variceal bleeding: The patient has a history of varices and has already experienced hematemesis. There is a risk of further bleeding.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory"

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a significant past medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis, encephalopathy, varices, hypertension, and recent motor vehicle accident. He was admitted for hematemesis, hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis. The patient has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and is now stable, off pressors, with a stable hematocrit (HCT) and leukocytosis resolved. He is on pressure support and remains depressed in mental status, preventing extubation. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is ventilating and oxygenating well. He has a positive cough and gag reflex but is off sedation. 

The patient had hematemesis and anemia with an unknown etiology, likely variceal bleed, but now underwent banding. His HCT has been stable for the past two days. The liver plan is to not scope unless signs of acute bleeding occur. 

The patient was hypotensive but is now normotensive, off levophed for over 24 hours. His creatinine is improving, and he has preserved ejection fraction. 

Leukocytosis was initially concerning for an infectious process but is now stable and normal for the past 48 hours.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, hypertension, and recent motor vehicle accident admitted for hematemesis. He is now in the ICU for hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is being ventilated and oxygenated well. He has a cough and gag reflex present. The plan is to wean sedation and extubate when his mental status allows.

The patient's hematemesis and anemia may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from esophageal varices given his history of cirrhosis. His hematocrit has been stable over the last day. There are plans to follow platelets daily and continue proton pump inhibitor IV every 12 hours. Ciprofloxacin has been started for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis, and vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam have been discontinued.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and his creatinine levels are improving. He has preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, and sources of infection include aspiration pneumonia versus SBP. Lactate levels are trending down. A CT scan with contrast is preferred if abdominal surgery is needed.

The patient's leukocytosis may be reactive in the setting of variceal bleeding, but it is now stable and normal for 48 hours. Vancomycin and piper"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, who presented to the hospital with massive hematemesis following a motor vehicle accident. He was intubated and transferred to this hospital due to acute respiratory failure, leukocytosis, and hypotensive episodes. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed grade III esophageal varices that were banded. He received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has stabilized since then. The patient has been on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode with a set tidal volume of 5 mL/kg and is looking good. A yeast infection in the sputum culture was identified. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/43 mmHg to 144/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on FiO2 of 40%. He is in sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has increased from 106 kg at admission to 116.6 kg currently. His central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range. The total fluid intake since midnight is 1,895 mL, including 799 mL of IV fluids, and the total output is 1,120 mL of blood products and 1,550 mL of urine. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 505 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, soft and distended abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema of 4+. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately, but movement, tone, and other neurological assessments could not be evaluated.

Laboratory results show stable hemoglobin levels, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Blood cultures were obtained on multiple occasions. Other lab values are within normal limits or show no significant changes.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is breathing well, but limited by poor mental status. Lactulose will be started through the nasogastric tube, and pressure support ventilation (PSV) will continue at 5 cmH2O.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has received a total of 15 L of fluids since admission, so diuresis will be initiated.
3. Poor mental status:"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and cirrhosis (MELD 21) admitted to the ICU for hematemesis, hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently intubated due to airway protection and is stable on pressure support. However, the patient has a depressed mental status preventing extubation. 

The patient has received multiple interventions, including banding for suspected variceal bleeding, placement of an OG tube, and prophylactic antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 125/58 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, anemia, and evidence of fluid overload. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions and prominent pulmonary vessels suggestive of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 

The patient's current plan includes monitoring respiratory function, managing anemia, maintaining normotension, and managing potential infections. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis, encephalopathy, and varices. He was admitted for hematemesis and is currently in the ICU. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is on pressure support. He has a depressed mental status and is producing copious secretions. His respiratory status is stable with adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, and he is no longer on vasopressors. His leukocytosis has resolved. The patient has a history of recent motor vehicle accident, hypertension, and EtOH abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and early identification of any signs of infection are crucial.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a history of hematemesis and variceal bleed. There is a risk of re-bleeding or development of new gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment for any signs of bleeding is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cirrhosis, GIB, ARF, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with increased work of breathing requiring increased ventilator settings. He is on a lasix drip for fluid overload and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's sedation level is currently high, and there are concerns about his ability to protect his own airway. There is evidence of infection with gram-negative rods and yeast in the sputum culture. The patient's labs show abnormalities in electrolytes and liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern. Due to fluid overload and inability to clear secretions, there is a risk of further respiratory failure. The patient's ventilation parameters need to be closely monitored, and a spontaneous breathing trial may be attempted soon.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by the use of lactulose and rifaximin. Monitoring for changes in mental status and neurological function is essential.

3. Infection: The sputum culture shows an infection with gram-negative rods and yeast. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the sensitivity results, and the source of the infection should be investigated.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleed, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and ARDS. The patient's current condition includes fluid overload, hypotension, inability to protect airway, and altered mental status. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with increased vent settings due to increased work of breathing. Lasix drip has been started to manage fluid overload. Rifaximin has been started for cirrhosis management. Sputum culture shows gram-negative rods and yeast. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a high risk of further deterioration due to ARDS. Continued monitoring and management of ventilation settings are necessary.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient is showing signs of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis management is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, fluid overload, or renal failure. Proper hemodynamic monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation or vasopressor support may be required.
4. Inability to Protect Airway: The patient's altered"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and liver failure. The patient has been in the ICU and requires various interventions and medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/50 to 157/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 373 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 29.6 mmHg and a fluid balance of -2,225 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including furosemide (Lasix) drip, pantoprazole (Protonix), and antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure and fluid resuscitation for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has a history of cirrhosis and encephalopathy, and is currently sedated on propofol. The patient is experiencing fluid overload and requires a significant amount of fluid removal, aiming for 2 liters today. He is being treated with lasix, rifaximin, lactulose, and ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with stable creatinine levels. His condition is critical, and he is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload needs to be carefully managed to avoid complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.
3. Cirrhosis/Encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and encephalopathy may lead to further deterioration in mental status or development of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. GI Bleed: There is a risk of rebleeding or ongoing bleeding from the GI tract, which could worsen the patient's condition.
5. ARF: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if not appropriately managed, leading to further deterioration in renal function.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing hospital"

- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypernatremia in the afternoon, resulting in a sodium level of 150. Free water was increased in tube feeds.
- The patient's blood pressure dropped twice, with the first time decreasing propofol and the second time slowing down the lasix gtt. A 250cc bolus was given, which had a good effect. The lasix gtt was restarted around 10 or 11 pm as the systolic blood pressure was in the 120s.
- The goal for the day is to remove 2 liters of fluid.
- The patient has bloody respiratory secretions and was given 5 units of vitamin K because the patient has not been eating for several days.
- The patient's respiratory rate is high at 2 am, with concerns about fatigue. The pressure support was increased from 9-5 to 15/5.
- The patient has allergies to no known drugs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving propofol sedation but is difficult to arouse. There is evidence of fluid overload, and the patient has been given lasix to promote diuresis. The patient's electrolytes and liver function tests are within normal limits. The patient's anemia is likely secondary to recent gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid overload.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there are concerns about the progression of renal failure.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia is likely due to recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a risk of recurrent bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing additional infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Sedation: The patient is heavily sedated with propofol, and there is a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been intubated and sedated on propofol. He has a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), cirrhosis of the liver, renal failure, and aspiration pneumonia.

24-hour events include hypernatremia corrected by free water administration, hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, increased respiratory rate, bloody respiratory secretions, and goal for tidal volume (TBB) of -2L.

Vital signs show a stable blood pressure but elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation remains within normal limits. The patient's fluid balance shows a significant positive balance due to ongoing fluid administration.

Lab results indicate electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate levels, low fibrinogen levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Assessment and plan include management of electrolyte and fluid disorders, pneumonia, hypotension, airway management, acute renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to fluid overload, and continuous lasix drip is being continued. Pressure support has been increased due to fatigue, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted either this"

   #Anemia, h/o recent GIB: HCT and platelets stable.
   -bloody secretions yesterday, though HCT has been stable, no other
   evidence of bleeding. Bronchoscopy showed evidence of recent mild
   bleeding, possible bronchial abrasions.
   -INR has been stable at 1.6, but with poor nutritional status. Vitamin
   K given [**10-1**].
   #Cirrhosis: Continue lactulose, rifaxamin. Had been on Cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis, now on Vanco/Zosyn.
   -f/u liver recs

   Disposition:  ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and other conditions. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, and anemia. He has been sedated on propofol and is intubated.

Recent events include a bronchoscopy that showed small amounts of blood in the left bronchi, likely abrasions from suctioning. The patient's endotracheal tube was repositioned, and a post-repositioning chest X-ray showed the tube in a better position. The patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric treatment of a suspected pneumonia.

The patient experienced a large amount of stool emptied from the rectal tube bag, and the lactulose dose was reduced. The patient's oxygenation has been challenging, with decreased PaO2/FiO2 ratio despite increasing the FiO2 levels. The patient also had rigors and a mild temperature increase, leading to the suspicion of an infectious component to his respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 66-81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/48-137/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 99%. The patient's central venous pressure is 13 mmHg, indicating fluid overload"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, GIB, and renal failure. He was admitted with respiratory failure and an altered mental state. The patient has been experiencing fever, rigors, increased respiratory rate, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray. He underwent bronchoscopy and was started on empiric vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected pneumonia. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia and hypokalemia. His liver function tests are abnormal, but his renal function remains stable. He is currently sedated on propofol and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by potential complications such as aspiration, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure indicates a critical condition that requires immediate intervention. The presence of fever and new infiltrates on chest X-ray raises suspicion for infectious causes like pneumonia or aspiration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever with rigors overnight suggests an ongoing systemic inflammatory response, potentially indicating sepsis. The combination of respiratory failure, fever, and suspected pneumonia increases the risk of sepsis.
3. Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's underlying cirrhosis and renal failure, along with the current respiratory distress and potential infection, there is a risk of MODS involving multiple organs"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of fluid resuscitation for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has increased secretions, rigors, and requires more ventilatory support, indicating the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has cirrhosis and encephalopathy, for which he is being treated with rifaximin and lactulose.

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count within normal limits, but there is an elevation in the platelet count. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and liver function tests are stable. The microbiology results from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 158/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg, and he has right and left lower extremity edema.

The patient's condition is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on imaging. He also has acute kidney injury (AKI"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with respiratory failure and a gastrointestinal bleed. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving fluid resuscitation. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with vital signs including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation being recorded regularly. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a recent increase in PEEP to 8 cmH2O. The patient experienced rigors overnight and underwent bronchoscopy, which showed findings consistent with suction trauma and a BAL of the left lower lobe was performed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased secretions, need for more ventilatory support, and rigors suggest the possibility of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and monitoring of respiratory system compliance and incentive spirometry are recommended to prevent VAP.

2. Liver failure/cirrhosis with encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, and it is important to monitor for signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin and lactulose are being administered to manage this condition.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are stable, indicating no immediate signs of renal failure. However, close monitoring of kidney function is necessary.

4. Sedation/propofol use: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to fluid overload and suspected infectious component. The patient has been sedated on propofol and mechanically ventilated. The patient's condition has been complicated by fevers, hypotension, renal failure, and electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by increased respiratory rate and the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the underlying cause (infection or fluid overload) is not adequately addressed.

2. Infection: The patient presents with fevers, and there is suspicion of an infectious component contributing to the respiratory failure. The patient is on empiric antibiotic therapy (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin), which should cover common hospital-acquired infections. However, the source of infection needs to be identified, and cultures should be monitored for appropriate treatment adjustments.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels. Fluid management and diuresis should be continued to maintain adequate urine output and prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte disorder, particularly hypernatremia (elevated sodium levels). Frequent monitoring and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is unknown, but there have been several significant events over the past 24 hours. These events include attempts to diurese due to low blood pressures, the use of levophed and lasix drip, consideration for renal ultrafiltration, increased respiratory rate after sedation reduction, increased ventilation support, fevers, and cultures pending.

The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, furosemide (lasix), pantoprazole (protonix), and propofol. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 114/48 to 124/55 mmHg, heart rate between 63 and 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 15 and 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is 109.6 kg, and height is 65 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is at 15 mmHg, and fluid balance shows a total input of 4,923 mL and total output of 3,580 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure and fluid resuscitation for gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been diagnosed with various conditions, including cirrhosis/encephalopathy, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and sedation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. The respiratory culture results are negative, indicating no current infection. However, the physician has decided to continue the antibiotics to prevent VAP.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, and there are concerns about the development or exacerbation of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is being treated with rifaximin and lactulose to manage this condition.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has shown some diuresis overnight but still requires further management to prevent fluid overload. Metolazone has been added to the treatment plan to help with fluid removal.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is experiencing hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and hypokalemia (low potassium levels). These electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected through free water repletion and potassium repletion, respectively."

   #Respiratory failure: likely [**3-5**] fluid overload, but now with increased
   suspicion for possible infectious component. Continuing to diurese,
   currently negative 1.5 liters.  Sedation reduced also.
   -continue diuresis with Lasix and metolazone 2.5 [**Hospital1 7**] for added diuretic
   effect for 1.5 liters negative goal today
   -started on empiric vanco/Zosyn/cipro, now day 5 of 7 day course, for
   previous new infiltrate read on CXR. Also with fevers/rigors and
   increased secretions three days ago, though improved now.
   - BAL final culture negative.
   - Currently on pressure support 15/5. Will attempt to wean further and
   will prepare for extubation tomorrow AM.
   #MS: Improved  now that weaning down propofol
   -continue lactulose and rifaximin with good BM.
   -will continue to attempt reducing propofol - lipase elevated to 211
   from 150 on [**10-4**].
   -re-check lipase tomorrow
    #Fevers:  new infiltrate seen on CXR, with continued low-grade fevers
   and uptrending white count.   Respiratory status improved. Continue
   with current management since all cultures negative to date.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn/cipro
   -BAL culture negative, blood cx negative to date
   -Trend temperature, Tylenol PRN for fevers, with max daily dose < 2
   grams.
    #Anemia, h/o recent GIB: HCT and platelets stable.
   -bloody secretions resolved, HCT has been stable, no other evidence of
   bleeding.
   -INR remains stable, no signs of active bleeding.
   #Cirrhosis: Continue lactulose, rifaxamin. Previously on Cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis, now on Vanco/Zosyn.
   -continue lactulose/rifaximin
 good bowel movements recently.
   -continue PPI
   #ARF: stable creatinine with good urine output, continuing diuresis.
   -will continue to monitor creatinine and electrolytes.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   We will hold tube feeds in am for planned extubation and continue to
   mobilize edema with lasix infusion. He will need to have family at
   bedside to assist with translation in case of anxiety peri-extubation.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, and other electrolyte and fluid disorders. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, renal failure, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation with propofol. The patient's condition has improved over time, with reduced sedation and weaning off propofol. However, the patient still has low potassium levels and elevated sodium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to fluid overload and potential infectious component.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels remain elevated despite increasing free water flushes. This can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not corrected.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium levels are trending low, which can cause muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other electrolyte disturbances.
4. Infection: The patient has been febrile with new infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicating a possible respiratory infection. The patient is still receiving antibiotics empirically.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and there is ongoing monitoring of creatinine and electrolyte levels.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and although the"

   Disposition:
","The patient's condition is stable, with improvements in respiratory status and urine output. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, possibly due to fluid overload. Although the respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk for further respiratory complications.

2. Infection: The patient has fevers, increased white blood cell count, and a previous new infiltrate on the chest X-ray. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. There is a suspicion of pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia given the patient's inability to protect their airway.

3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has persistent hypernatremia (high sodium) and hypokalemia (low potassium). Close monitoring and repletion of these electrolytes are necessary.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Monitoring of renal function and diuresis is important to prevent further deterioration.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, although it seems to be resolved at the moment. Continued monitoring for any signs of bleeding is important.

6. Cirrhosis: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, and management includes lactulose and rifaximin to prevent hepatic encephalopathy. Prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) should also be considered.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding, cirrhosis of the liver, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hypernatremia (high sodium), fever of unknown origin, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia (aspiration), hypotension, inability to protect airway, renal failure, alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal bleed, and possible Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's current treatment plan includes diuresis with Lasix and metolazone to manage fluid overload and negative 1.5 liters goal today. The patient is also on empiric vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for previous new infiltrate read on chest X-ray and fevers/rigors. The patient's sedation has been reduced, and there is an attempt to wean off propofol. The patient's nutritional support includes Nutren 2.0 at 30 mL/hour. Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, and VAP precautions with elevated head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening hypernatremia, development of sepsis due to the unknown origin of fever, worsening electrolyte and fluid disorder, worsening pneumonia, hypotension, further airway compromise,"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 9877**] appears ready for extubation with continued net negative
   fluid balance and stable oxygenation. He will have body position
   optimized and family at bedside to help with anxiety that has likely
   caused problems with [**Name (NI) 1398**] of > 130. I suspect that once his ETT has
   been pulled, we will have better control of BP and ability to tolerate
   diuretics ( including aldactone). Full antibiotic course to conclude
   this week.

   -continue diuresis with Lasix and metolazone 2.5 [**Hospital1 7**] for added diuretic
   effect for 1.5 liters negative goal today
   -started on empiric vanco/Zosyn/cipro, now day 6 of 7 day course, for
   previous new infiltrate read on CXR. Also with fevers/rigors and
   increased secretions three days ago, though improved now.
   - BAL final culture negative.
   - Currently on pressure support [**1-5**]. Will attempt to wean further and
   consider extubation, though pulling rather small tidal volumes
   currently.
   #MS: Improved  now that weaning down propofol

   #Electrolytes:  Sodium remains consistently elevated despite increasing
   free water flushes, potassium trending low.
    -continue to replete potassium, mag, phos.
   -continue D5W at increased rate and free water flushes.  Follow lytes
   Q12.
   -continue potassium repletion
 add K to D5W fluids.
   -add spironolactone as low na and high k probably potentiated by high

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history significant for MELD 21 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and varices, EtOH abuse, HTN, and recent MVA admitted for hematemesis now transferred to the MICU for hypotension, ARF, and leukocytosis. The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding which has resolved but is now experiencing pneumonia and volume overload. The patient is attempting to diurese and extubate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, likely due to fluid overload, but there is an increased suspicion for possible infectious component. The patient is being diuresed and sedation has been reduced.

2. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient's sodium levels remain consistently elevated despite increasing free water flushes.

3. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia): The patient has had fevers and rigors for the past three days, although they have improved now.

4. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other: The patient has low potassium levels and is at risk for developing further electrolyte imbalances.

5. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has an increased suspicion for possible infectious component in their respiratory failure, which may be due to aspiration pneumonia.

6. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient has a history of hypotension"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 21 EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, varices, EtOH abuse, HTN, and recent MVA. The patient was admitted for hematemesis and is now in the MICU due to hypotension, ARF, and leukocytosis. The patient has GIB that has resolved, but now has concerns about pneumonia and volume overload. The patient is attempting to diurese and extubate.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 131/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's CVP is 10 mmHg, and the fluid balance shows a positive input of 7,444 mL and an output of 8,090 mL with a negative balance of -646 mL.

Laboratory results show potassium levels ranging from 3.0 to 4.3 mEq/L, sodium levels between 136 and 145 mg/dL, and a glucose level of 176 mg/dL. Other labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's creatinine level is stable, and there is evidence of moderate pulmonary edema and stable moderate cardiomeg"

- He was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a massive upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and required intubation.
- Banding of esophageal varices was performed, and the patient developed hypotension, renal failure, and leukocytosis.
- The patient was extubated yesterday, and renal failure and leukocytosis resolved.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support 15/5.
- He is alert and much improved.
- There are concerns regarding possible infections, pneumonia, anemia due to recent GIB, cirrhosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient's sodium levels remain elevated, and potassium levels are very low.
- The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and appropriate treatments and interventions are being implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, which has improved after diuresis and antibiosis. He is now extubated.
2. Pneumonia: The patient had a new infiltrate on chest X-ray, and empiric antibiotics were started. BAL culture was negative.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and hypokalemia (low potassium levels). These imbalances need to be managed carefully.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He has remained extubated and is diuresing wel with dry MM. He does
   have issues with anxiety on account of the language barrier. He will
   transition to PO
s today and have a formal S/S evaluation in am [**2187-10-9**].
   Hopefully, aldactone will preclude the need for vigorous K repletion
   too.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is ill but improving with hopes of transitioning to floor in am

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred from the emergency department to the MICU after experiencing a massive upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB). He underwent banding of large esophageal varices and subsequently developed hypotension, renal failure, and leukocytosis. The patient has been extubated and is currently alert, conversant, and slightly agitated. He has coarse bilateral breath sounds but with good air movement in anterior lung fields. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and positive for bowel sounds. The patient also has pedal edema bilaterally but has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to fluid overload and possible pneumonia. After receiving diuretics and antibiotics, his respiratory status has improved, and he is now extubated.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are consistently elevated, indicating hypernatremia. It is essential to monitor and manage his fluid and electrolyte balance carefully.
3. Fever, Unknown Origin: The patient had fevers and rigors several days ago, although he is now afebrile. There is a possibility of ongoing infection, and further investigation may be required.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance need to be closely monitored and managed due to his history of cirrhosis, recent gastrointestinal"

The patient has since been extubated and his renal failure and leukocytosis have resolved.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia, hypotension, inability to protect airway, renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal bleeding, and aspiration pneumonia. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had fluid overload, but now has possible pneumonia superimposed. He is improving after diuresis and antibiosis. Continue diuresis with Lasix and add metolazone and spironolactone for added diuretic effect.

2. Hypernatremia: Continue to replete potassium, magnesium, and phosphate. Increase potassium repletion and add K to D5W fluids.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin: Continue to trend temperature and administer Tylenol PRN for fevers, with a maximum daily dose of 2 grams.

4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: Monitor creatinine and electrolytes. Continue diuresis with Las"

   -lab value peaked 2 days ago, now decreasing slowly
   -off propofol
   -continue to trend and monitor symptoms, imaging if clinically
   indicated.
    #Possible infection:  Afebrile, leukocytosis resolved for past 2 days
   after 2 day increase.   Respiratory status improved. Continue with
   current management since all cultures negative to date.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn/cipro
   -BAL culture negative, blood cx negative to date
   -Trend temperature, Tylenol PRN for fevers, with max daily dose < 2
   grams.
    #Anemia, h/o recent GIB: HCT and platelets stable.  Will continue to
   follow given history of recent UGIB.
   -GI recommends repeat banding next week - will follow recs.
   -INR remains stable, no signs of active bleeding.
   -Continue PPI
   #Cirrhosis: Continuing lactulose, rifaxamin. Previously on Cipro for
   SBP prophylaxis, now on Vanco/Zosyn.
   -restart cipro now that d/c-ing vanco/zosyn
   #ARF: stable creatinine with good urine output, continuing diuresis.
   -will continue to monitor creatinine and electrolytes.
   -continue diuresis with lasix and metolazone/spironolactone when
   cleared by s&s, goal 1-2 liters negative per day.
   #Electrolytes:  Sodium remains consistently elevated though slightly
   improved from several days ago, potassium remains very low.
    -continue to replete potassium, mag, phos.
   -continue D5W at increased rate and free water flushes.  Follow lytes
   Q12.
   -increase potassium repletion
 add K to D5W fluids.
   -with spironolactone, expect to increase

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU is as follows:

1. The patient has respiratory failure due to fluid overload and possible pneumonia. Diuretics and antibiotics have improved the condition, and the patient was successfully extubated yesterday.
2. The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and is being managed with diuretics to achieve a negative fluid balance.
3. The patient has fever of unknown origin and is being treated empirically for various infections. Cultures have been negative to date.
4. The patient has renal failure and is being managed with diuretics to maintain good urine output. Creatinine levels are stable.
5. The patient has cirrhosis of the liver and is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin. Prophylactic antibiotics have been given for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
6. The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding and is being monitored closely with ongoing management of the bleeding risk.
7. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, with consistently elevated sodium levels and low potassium levels. Aggressive repletion of potassium, magnesium, and phosphate is ongoing.
8. The patient's anemia is likely related to a recent gastrointestinal bleed, but platelet and hematocrit levels are stable.
9. The patient's agitation may be due to elevated lipase levels, possibly indicating pancreatitis. Sedation"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, likely due to fluid overload and possible pneumonia.
- The patient has shown improvement after diuretics and antibiotics were administered.
- The patient was extubated yesterday and is alert and much improved.
- The patient has a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding and cirrhosis of the liver.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- The patient's electrolyte levels remain imbalanced, with elevated sodium and low potassium.
- The patient's renal function is stable, and diuretics will continue to be used to manage fluid balance.
- The patient's lipase levels are elevated, but decreasing slowly.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending, and previous cultures have been negative.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, which may have been caused by fluid overload and possible pneumonia. Although the patient has shown improvement, there is still a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or further fluid accumulation.

2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's sodium levels remain consistently elevated, and potassium levels remain low. This imbalance needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent any potential complications related to electrolyte disturbances.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can be exacerbated by factors such as dehydration or further electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), cirrhosis of the liver, renal failure, aspiration pneumonia, and electrolyte imbalances. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had acute respiratory failure initially, which improved after diuresis and antibiosis. However, there is a possibility of pneumonia superimposed on fluid overload. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function is necessary.
2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium) and hypokalemia (low potassium). Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is required.
3. Fever, unknown origin: The patient has been experiencing fever without a known source. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding, which may have led to anemia. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and following recommendations for repeat banding next week is advised.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, and management includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin. Monitoring of liver function and ascites formation is necessary.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and close monitoring of creatinine and electrolytes is needed. Continuing diuresis with metolazone/spironolactone and repletion of potassium, magnesium, and phosphate are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-inch, 98.6 kg individual admitted to the ICU with complaints of GI bleed and respiratory failure. The patient is currently extubated and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/90 to 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient has a CVP of 8 mmHg, total fluid intake of 3,407 mL, and total fluid output of 5,265 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,858 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix) and Lasix. 

The patient's blood work shows a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 65 K/uL, platelet count of 28 mg/dL, sodium level of 146 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride level of 99 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 38 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 34.0%, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, glucose level of 169 mg/dL, and lipase level of 183 IU/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has respiratory failure post-resuscitation for a GI bleed and is now extubated. Volume overload is still present, but the patient is diuresing well. Lasix drip has been turned off, and the goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 1-1.5 L. The elevated lipase level is trending down. The patient will undergo a gastrointestinal (GI) scope and banding next week. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Respiratory failure due to the patient's initial condition and possible ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
2. Volume overload, which has been addressed with Lasix therapy.
3. Elevated lipase level, which could indicate pancreatitis or another pancreatic disorder.
4. GI bleed, which may require further intervention such as endoscopy or surgery.
5. Infection due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines and devices.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan."
