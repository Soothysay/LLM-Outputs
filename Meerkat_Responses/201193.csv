   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient underwent an EGD, however she began becoming agitated and
   desated so she had to be intubated so that the EGD could be finished.
   On EGD a firm area of ulceration which was thought to be a mass was
   visualized.  Given her elevated INR, no biopsy was taken.  There did
   not appear to be active bleeding.
   - She was left intubated overnight with plans to extubate her in the
   am.
   - Hct after admission decreased from 29.3 to 25 so she was transfused 1
   unit of PRBC.  Repeat INR was 1.2.

   hematemesis is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.
   - pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt for suspected upper source, no octreotide as
   low probability of varices
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - active type and will keep 4 units active crossmatch tonight,
   transfuse to ~30
   - f/u GI, per ED, they plan to scope tonight
   .
   # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA. depending on findings on EGD, ERCP vs EUS
   vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this indeed arises
   from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.

   # atrial fibrillation:
   - hold anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who presents with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and a mass in the duodenum. The patient was initially managed with pantoprazole and fentanyl, and later intubated due to agitation and desaturation during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). A firm area of ulceration resembling a mass was visualized during the EGD, but no biopsy was taken due to the patient's elevated INR. The patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and her repeat INR was 1.2.

The patient has a history of painless jaundice and chalky stools, which are concerning for cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). Further evaluation with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be helpful in determining the origin of the mass.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 119/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

","The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and a mass in the duodenum. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a firm area of ulceration and a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum. The mass appeared to have stigmata of recent bleeding and was of malignant appearance. The lumen of the duodenum was also narrowed by the lesion. Despite this, the scope was able to traverse the mass, and injections of epinephrine were applied for hemostasis, which were successful.

The patient's INR was elevated, so a biopsy could not be taken. Her Hct decreased from 29.3 to 25, so she received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Her repeat INR was 1.2.

The patient was left intubated overnight with plans to extubate her in the morning. However, she became agitated and desaturated, necessitating intubation again to complete the EGD.

   visualized.  Given her elevated INR, no biopsy was taken.  There did
   not appear to be active bleeding.
   - She was left intubated overnight with plans to extubate her in the
   am.
   - Hct after admission decreased from 29.3 to 25 so she was transfused 1
   unit of PRBC.  Repeat INR was 1.2.
   This am the patient is awake and gestures that she wants the ETT
   removed.

   EGD ([**2-11**]): Protruding Lesions: An ulcerated circumferential mass with
   stigmata of recent bleeding and of malignant appearance was found at
   the proximal second part of the duodenum just past the apex of the
   duodenal bulb. The mass was able to be traversed by the scope, but the
   lumen appeared to be narrowed by the lesion. 4 injections of [**1-27**] cc of
   Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier **] were applied for hemostasis with success.
   Impression: Blood in the duodenum

   # Respiratory support: Patient intubated for the EGD secondary and
   continued on the ventilator overnight to allow sedation time to wear
   off.  This am she is alert and indicating that she wants the tube
   removed.
   - Will extubate her this am.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Melena followed by
   hematemesis is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a
   mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.
   - Change pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt to po bid
   - Patient only has 1 18-guage PIV and she has very difficult access.
   Consider placing a PICC.
   - active type and has 3 units active crossmatch currently, transfuse to

   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Will keep the patient NPO for now.
   - Hct is stable this am at 30.3. (Had gotten 3 units total since
   arriving at [**Location (un) 78**]).  Will check q8h Hct.
   - Will have discussion with the patient and the family about the
   findings on EGD and their wishes of how aggressive they want to be
   regarding diagnosis and treatment options before making further plans
   for diagnosis.
   # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.
   - Will discuss the findings of the EGD once the patient is extubated
   and alert with her and her family to decide on how aggressive they want
   to be with diagnosis.
   - CXR showed a possible nodule, will likely need to have a chest CT for
   workup for metastatic disease.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, presenting with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and a mass in the duodenum. She underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a firm area of ulceration that appeared to be a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum. The mass was concerning for malignancy and there were stigmata of recent bleeding. The patient became agitated and desaturated during the EGD, so she had to be intubated for the procedure to be completed.

The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) for a decrease in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 29.3 to 25. She was also transfused with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 14.2. Her INR is now stable at 1.2.

The patient's respiratory support includes being intubated and on a ventilator, but she is alert and indicating that she wants the tube removed. She will be extubated in the morning.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), as well as abnormal liver function tests including alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) and total bilirubin (Tot Bilirubin). Her blood cultures are"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - successfully extubated
   - patient told about mass and very high likelihood that it is cancer,
   also told about the lung nodules and that those may be metastases.
   Explained possibility of biopsy vs. palliative pancreatic/duodenal
   stent placement. Patient said she is leaning towards stent placement as
   she's 'had a good life' and would prefer to focus on comfort.  She
   asked about possibility of surgery or chemo - explained that the
   surgery would not be able to entirely remove the mass nor is she a good
   candidate given her age and that chemo is systemically toxic though
   could explore options if she and family are interested.
   - called daughter and relayed above information - she plans on coming
   in on Monday to discuss
   - social work consult placed
   - likely plan for CT Monday (not yet ordered) to further evaluate lung
   nodules
   - need to call ERCP Monday to set up for this week (more urgently if
   spikes)
   - hct stable 32--->30--->25.1, got 1u pRBC overnight, repeat hct this

   - patient told about mass and very high likelihood that it is cancer,
   also told about the lung nodules and that those may be metastases.
   Explained possibility of biopsy vs. palliative pancreatic/duodenal
   stent placement. Patient said she is leaning towards stent placement as
   she's 'had a good life' and would prefer to focus on comfort.  She
   asked about possibility of surgery or chemo - explained that the

   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source:  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   Melena followed by hematemesis is c/w upper GI
   bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan
   demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection, density suspicious for
   blood, involving the duodenum with compression of the CBD with
   intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying malignancy may have
   eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally and out of the
   lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a mass in the
   proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning for
   malignancy.
   - discussed findings with patient and daughter
 patient expressed that
   she is leaning towards palliative stenting, daughter to come in today
   to discuss with team
   - coninute pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt to po bid
   - check pm hct goal  >27
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Will keep the patient NPO for now.
   - Hct is stable this am at 30.3. (Had gotten 3 units total since
   arriving at [**Location (un) 78**]).  Will check q8h Hct.
   - Will have discussion with the patient and the family about the
   findings on EGD and their wishes of how aggressive they want to be
   regarding diagnosis and treatment options before making further plans
   for diagnosis.
   # Respiratory support: Extubated successful yyesterday morning. Patient
   was intubated for the EGD secondary and continued on the ventilator
   overnight to allow sedation time to wear off.
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.
   - Will discuss the findings of the EGD once the patient is extubated
   and alert with her and her family to decide on how aggressive they want
   to be with diagnosis.
   - CXR showed a possible nodule, will likely need to have a chest CT for
   workup for metastatic disease
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient is on coumadin at home and by report had
   an INR > assay at [**Location (un) 78**] and received 2 units of FFP.  Here her INR
   has been <2, this am was 1.1.
   - hold anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding
   - Restart diltiazem.

","Summary:
The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, who was admitted to the ICU for acute blood loss anemia/upper GI source. She has a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum, concerning for malignancy. The patient underwent an EGD, which revealed a mass with stigmata of recent bleeding and a diverticulum in the second part of the duodenum. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 115/58 mmHg and a heart rate of 66 bpm. The patient's Hct is stable at 30.3%. She is currently NPO and receiving pantoprazole 40mg IV qbid. The patient's family has been informed about the findings and is discussing further plans for diagnosis and treatment. The patient's respiratory support has been weaned off, as she was successfully extubated yesterday morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper GI bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
3. Anemia: The patient has experienced acute blood loss anemia, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Malignancy: The mass in the proximal second part of the duod"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a mass in the duodenum. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been stable, and they have received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. The source of bleeding is the mass surrounding the duodenum seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient has melena followed by hematemesis, which is consistent with upper GI bleeding. 

The patient underwent an EGD last night, which showed a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum concerning for malignancy. The patient expressed leaning towards palliative stenting, and the daughter will come in today to discuss with the team. Pantoprazole 40mg IV has been continued to be given twice a day.

The patient was intubated for the EGD and continued on the ventilator overnight to allow sedation time to wear off. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday morning.

The patient has a history of painless jaundice and chalk-colored stools, which is concerning for cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer. ERCP, EUS, or MRCP may be helpful in delineating the origin of the mass.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelets, and liver enzymes. The CEA level is elevated at 18 (normal"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - successfully extubated
   - patient told about mass and very high likelihood that it is cancer,
   also told about the lung nodules and that those may be metastases.
   Explained possibility of biopsy vs. palliative pancreatic/duodenal
   [** 80**] placement. Patient said she is leaning towards [** 80**] placement as
   she's 'had a good life' and would prefer to focus on comfort.  She
   asked about possibility of surgery or chemo - explained that the
   surgery would not be able to entirely remove the mass nor is she a good
   candidate given her age and that chemo is systemically toxic though
   could explore options if she and family are interested.
   - called daughter and relayed above information - she plans on coming
   in on Monday to discuss
   - social work consult placed
   - likely plan for CT Monday (not yet ordered) to further evaluate lung

   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 3505**] has extubated safely and is aware of current medical issues.
   She had a sense that a malignant diagnosis might be the problem given
   early satiety and weight loss. She denies abdominal pain or dyspnea.
   She is agreeable to palliative [**Known lastname 80**] placement if that will temporize
   her symptoms. She wishes to discuss this with her family too. She
   needed one unit of pRBC
s for hct of 25.1
   Exam notable for mild icterusTm 97 BP 116/54 HR 70 RR of 16 with sats
   of 96% on 2lpm . she has marked kyphosis and end inspiratory crackles
   at bothbases. Labs notable for WBC 11.9K, HCT of 29.8, K+ of 3.2 .
   Agree with plan to update family and then request ERCP consultation for
   palliative [**Known lastname 80**] placement. She will likely need intubation for this
   given difficulty with EGD. A chest CT scan will be performed to assess
   RUL nodules today. She will remain on IV PPI today and in the ICU till
   procedures completed. She remains a DNR by prior stated wishes.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a mass in the duodenum. She is currently in the ICU and has been extubated successfully. The patient has been informed about the mass and the possibility of cancer, and she is leaning towards palliative pancreatic/duodenal placement. Her family is also involved in the decision-making process. The patient's condition is stable, but her prognosis is guarded. Potential medical complications that can arise include further bleeding from the mass, complications related to the planned ERCP procedure, and the possibility of metastatic disease given the lung nodules seen on CXR.

   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD and a mass concerning for malignancy on
   EGD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Hct stable at 29.8 this
   morning after 1 unit pRBC overnight.  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by hematemesis
   which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a
   mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.
   - discussed findings with patient and daughter

   findings on EGD and their wishes of how aggressive they want to be
   regarding diagnosis and treatment options before making further plans
   for diagnosis.

   # Respiratory support: Extubated successful yyesterday morning. Patient
   was intubated for the EGD secondary and continued on the ventilator
   overnight to allow sedation time to wear off.
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a mass at the duodenum with dilated common bile duct. The patient has a known malignancy concern and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to a decrease in hemoglobin levels. This can result in symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness.

2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the ongoing treatment and hospitalization, increasing the risk of developing infections.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support, including extubation, should be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or pneumonia.

4. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or bleeding events.

5. Malignancy progression: The presence of a mass in the duodenum and dilated common bile duct raises concerns about the progression of malignancy, which could lead to further complications such as jaundice or liver dysfunction.

6. Thromboembolic events: Immobility and the presence of atrial fibrillation increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emb"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly female with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, mass in the duodenum, and dilated common bile duct. She has been admitted to the ICU and has received 4 units of packed red blood cells during her admission. Her hemoglobin levels have been stable. The source of the upper GI bleeding is a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient wants palliative stenting for the mass.

The patient also has hyponatremia, possibly due to SIADH or slight volume overload. Her sodium levels have decreased from 138 to 132. She does not appear to be volume overloaded, so it is likely SIADH. The plan is to advance her diet, hold intravenous fluids, and let her regulate her intake. If she remains hyponatremic, urine lytes will be checked and fluid restriction will be considered.

The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin at home. Her INR has been below 2, and she received one dose of diltiazem yesterday with asymptomatic hypotension and bradycardia. Anticoagulation will be held until active bleeding has stopped.

Other findings include bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe/lingular and bilateral lower lobes, scattered tree-in-bud opacities in the right upper and left upper lobes, a nodular"

   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD and a mass concerning for malignancy on
   EGD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Hct stable at 29.8 this
   morning after 1 unit pRBC overnight.  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by hematemesis
   which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD which showed a mass in the
   proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning for
   malignancy.
   - The findings were discussed with the patient and her family
 the
   patient expressed that she wants palliative stenting which is now
   planned for [**2-15**]

   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Hct is stable this am at 29.8, will recheck this afternoon, has
   gotten a total of 4 units pRBC
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.  The prelim read on the chest CT did not show metastases.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin who presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a mass at the duodenum with dilated common bile duct. The patient has a known malignancy concern, and the source of bleeding is identified as the mass surrounding the duodenum seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). 

The patient underwent an EGD, which revealed a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum concerning for malignancy. The patient expressed a desire for palliative stenting, which is now planned for February 15th. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole 40 mg orally twice a day.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable at 29.8% this morning after receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) overnight. The patient has received a total of 4 units of pRBC.

Additionally, the patient has a history of painless jaundice and chalk-colored stools, which are concerning for cholangiocarcinoma. An ERCP, EUS, or MRCP may be helpful in delineating the origin of the mass, whether it arises from the biliary tree or neighboring structures. The preliminary read on the chest CT did not show any metastases, but the CA 19-9 level is elevated at 18 (normal 0-"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She has a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum, concerning for malignancy. She also has dilated common bile duct (CBD) with intrahepatic ductal dilatation, possibly due to a mass or fluid collection surrounding the duodenum. This could be indicative of cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer. She has had blood transfusions for acute blood loss anemia. Her vital signs are stable, and she is alert and appropriate. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and mildly low sodium levels. Imaging studies reveal bronchiectasis, scattered tree-in-bud opacities, nodular opacity in the right upper and lower lobes, small bilateral pleural effusions, non-specific bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, extensive atherosclerosis with multifocal areas of ulcerated plaque, and severe biliary dilatation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleeding: The patient has already experienced melena followed by hematemesis, indicating upper GI bleeding. The source of bleeding is a mass surrounding the duodenum, which is concerning for malignancy. Further intervention such as palliative stenting may be necessary.
2. Cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer: The patient's dilated"

   admission (last transfused the night of [**2-12**]).  Source is mass
   surrounding dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by
   hematemesis which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for
   lavage at [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid
   collection, density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with
   compression of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an
   underlying malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both
   intraluminally and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD which showed
   a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning

   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, mass in the duodenum, and dilated common bile duct. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 119/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's family has requested palliative stenting for comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper GI bleeding, which is concerning for potential re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss.
2. Malignancy: The presence of a mass in the duodenum concerning for malignancy raises the possibility of cancer progression or spread.
3. Cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer: The dilated common bile duct and elevated alkaline phosphatase level suggest the possibility of biliary tree involvement, potentially indicating cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level has decreased from 138 to 132, indicating hyponatremia. This may be due to SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion) or slight volume overload.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a mass in the duodenum with dilated common bile duct. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, ibuprofen, aspirin, estrogens, and unknown reactions to fosamax. She received erythromycin as a last dose of antibiotics. The patient is currently on various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), diltiazem, trazodone, colace, and senna. There are no changes to her medical and family history, review of systems, or flow sheet data except where noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's presentation with upper GI bleeding indicates a potential complication related to the duodenal mass. Further evaluation and management are required to address this issue.

2. Anticoagulation reversal: The patient's atrial fibrillation management with Coumadin puts her at risk for bleeding complications. In the setting of GI bleeding, anticoagulation was reversed.

3. Oliguria: The patient is experiencing oliguria, which may indicate renal dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation. This should be further investigated and managed appropriately.

4. Duodenal mass: The presence of a duodenal mass with dilated CBD raises concerns about possible malignancy or obstructive pathology. Further diagnostic evaluation, such as endoscopy or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a mass in the duodenum with dilated common bile duct. The patient's allergies include penicillins, ibuprofen, aspirin, estrogens, and fosamax. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/55 to 139/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on various medications, including pantoprazole, diltiazem, trazodone, colace, and senna. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the upper GI bleeding and duodenal mass. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals a tree-in-bud pattern on chest CT with lymphadenopathy and dilated common bile duct. The patient's urine culture is negative. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper GI bleeding is a significant concern. If not properly managed, it could lead to further blood loss, hypotension, shock, and organ failure.
2. Duodenal mass: The presence of a duodenal mass may"
