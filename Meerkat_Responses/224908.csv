   TACHYCARDIA -- increased from baseline tachycardia (100-120).
   Relatively asymptomatic.  ECG apprears as flutter --> trial of
   adenosine.  Rate control now with Diltiazem drip.  EP consultation to
   assess for chemical vs. electrical cardioversion.
   HYPOTENTION -- relative hypotension.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for seizure.  Continue Keppra.
   FLUIDS -- net volume depleted.  Plan to replete.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who has recently undergone a stem cell transplant for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The patient's medical history includes chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient presented with tachycardia, which was initially controlled using adenosine and then maintained with a diltiazem drip. The patient's vital signs show relative hypotension and they have been NPO (nothing by mouth) since admission.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and no signs of edema. The cardiovascular examination shows a hyperdynamic precordium and normal heart sounds without murmurs or abnormal splits. The respiratory examination is clear bilaterally, and the abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds.

The laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a WBC count of 243 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 43 K/uL, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL. The patient's electrolytes are relatively normal, but their kidney function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. The liver function tests show slightly elevated levels of ALT and AST.

The patient's current plan includes ongoing rate control for tachycardia, fluid repletion, continuation of seizure prophylaxis, and anticoagulation. The patient's disposition remains"

","The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans following a stem cell transplant for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The patient presented to the ICU with tachycardia, transient hypotension, and atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. The patient's vital signs include a blood pressure of 127/61 mmHg, heart rate of 150-155 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, and temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius.

Physical examination findings include a well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, normal pupils, and no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. The cardiovascular examination revealed a hyperdynamic precordium, normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, and no signs of peripheral edema. The respiratory examination showed clear breath sounds bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. The abdominal examination was notable for soft and non-tender bowel sounds, no distension or tenderness, and no palpable masses. The extremities were warm and well-perfused without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination demonstrated oriented and attentive behavior with purposeful movement, normal muscle tone, and no focal deficits.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with [**Year (4 digits) **]
   PO Diltiazem would be ideal however given he could not tolerate any PO
   meds this AM and he is currently requiring a diltiazem gtt. Speech and
   swallow are aware of him and will see him today. Adenosine EKG shows
   clear A. flutter 2:1 with a rate of 150. t EP consult felt that D/C
   cardioversion would be definitive treatment for A. Flutter, however
   with new pneumonitis would hold off unitl
nidus
 resolves. Further D/C
   Cardioversion is complicated by the difficulty in protecting his airway
   for sedation, and amiodarone is obviously a poor choice given his
   underlying bonchiolitis obliterans.  Pt has h.o. of Heparin allergy. In
   terms of the causes of his A. flutter with [**Name (NI) **] pt recently had an Echo
   performed [**2-6**] which showed no evidence of valvular disease given his
   history ischaemic injury is also low on the differential. Will check
   TSH, T4 level.
   - continue IV diltiazem gtt if pt is persistently in A. flutter with
   [**Month/Day (4) **]
   - Speech & swallow assessment tomorrow to determine whether pt is OK to
   start PO regimen which would be ideal
   - if no PO, would discuss PEG with family
   - defer cardioversion until chemical peumonitis resolves
   - A/C tomorrow will be complicated.
   .
   Chemical Pneumonitis: Pt noted to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR, likely
   chemical pneumonitis from his aspiration event. No leukocytosis is
   noted on lab draw, no fevers. His A. flutter predates his aspiration
   event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his A. flutter. It could be
   a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops into a PNA. Will not
   treat for aspiration PNA given lack of infectious signs. If pt become
   febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis would have a low threshold to put
   on abx coverage for aspiration PNA.
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO
   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current
   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to
   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to
   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the
   family they have decided against PEG tubes. NGT would be undesirable
   given his severe sinus disease and recent nasal intubation.
   - f/u S&S tomorrow
   - follow electrolytes
   .
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Suspect pre-renal for the same reason as above.
   -Bolus 1L NS
   .
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on
   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV
   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.
   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper
   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV
   .
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry
   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,
   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral
   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time
   interval would be atypical.
   - will recheck Hct
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Pt was initially admitted with AMS that was thought to be possibly
   seizures given his known temporal lobe mass versus delirium given his
   initial underlying PNA. Since his extubation last week he has remained
   orientated to person, place, time.
   - cont to monitor patient for signs of AMS
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   Pt currently not tolerating PO intake, this AM was noted to have
   increased coughing with medications/liquids. Will keep him NPO for now
   with speech and swallow evaluating tomorrow. As mentioned previously
   family did not want trach placed, NGT also undesirable given his recent
   nasal intubation, sinusitis. Pt has poor opening of his mouth which
   would make an OGT difficult too. Can consider TPN vs PPN whilst pt is
   NPO however the concern would be whether this would be anything more
   than a short term solution.
   - f/u S&S eval tomorrow.
   - NPO for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of malignant neoplasm, chronic GVHD, and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has been experiencing atrial flutter with a rate of 150, which has been present since [**Year (4 digits)**]. He is receiving IV diltiazem as a treatment. The patient also has a recent history of poor PO intake and is currently NPO. He has been started on IV methylprednisolone equivalent dose due to chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient's Hct level was initially 33 but dropped to 19 on the floor draw, indicating possible hemolysis. He is being monitored for signs of altered mental status and alteration in nutrition. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated WBC count of 9.3, slightly low Hct level of 26.1, and slightly elevated Cr level of 1.3. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient has a history of heparin allergy. The patient's current medications"

   - if no PO, would discuss PEG with family
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to discuss ablation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Will need
   bivalirudin if we are considering ablation and wait until tomorrow
   .
   Chemical Pneumonitis: Pt noted to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR, likely
   chemical pneumonitis from his aspiration event. No leukocytosis is
   noted on lab draw, no fevers. His A. flutter predates his aspiration
   event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his A. flutter. It could be
   a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops into a PNA. Will not
   treat for aspiration PNA given lack of infectious signs. If pt become
   febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis would have a low threshold to put
   on abx coverage for aspiration PNA.
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO
   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current
   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to
   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to
   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the
   family they have decided against PEG tubes. NGT would be undesirable
   given his severe sinus disease and recent nasal intubation.
   - f/u S&S tomorrow
   - follow electrolytes
   .
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Suspect pre-renal for the same reason as above.
   -Bolus 1L NS
   .
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on
   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV
   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.
   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper
   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV
   .
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry
   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,
   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral
   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time
   interval would be atypical.
   - will recheck Hct
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Pt was initially admitted with AMS that was thought to be possibly
   seizures given his known temporal lobe mass versus delirium given his
   initial underlying PNA. Since his extubation last week he has remained
   orientated to person, place, time.
   - cont to monitor patient for signs of AMS

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   NPO STATUS:
   This is a major barrier to all of his treatment issues.  Pt currently
   not tolerating PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing
   with medications/liquids. Will keep him NPO for now with speech and
   swallow evaluating tomorrow. As mentioned previously family did not
   want trach placed, NGT also undesirable given his recent nasal
   intubation, sinusitis. Pt has poor opening of his mouth which would
   make an OGT difficult too. Can consider TPN vs PPN whilst pt is NPO
   however the concern would be whether this would be anything more than a
   short term solution.
   - f/u S&S eval tomorrow.
   - NPO for now
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with [**Year (4 digits) **]
   PO Diltiazem would be ideal however given he could not tolerate any PO
   meds this AM and he is currently requiring a diltiazem gtt. Speech and
   swallow are aware of him and will see him today. Adenosine EKG shows
   clear A. flutter 2:1 with a rate of 150. t EP consult felt that D/C
   cardioversion would be definitive treatment for A. Flutter, however
   with new pneumonitis would hold off unitl
nidus
 resolves. Further D/C
   Cardioversion is complicated by the difficulty in protecting his airway
   for sedation, and amiodarone is obviously a poor choice given his
   underlying bonchiolitis obliterans.  Pt has h.o. of Heparin allergy. In
   terms of the causes of his A. flutter with [**Name (NI) **] pt recently had an Echo
   performed [**2-6**] which showed no evidence of valvular disease given his
   history ischaemic injury is also low on the differential. Will check
   TSH, T4 level.
   - continue IV diltiazem gtt if pt is persistently in A. flutter with
   [**Month/Day (4) **]
   - Speech & swallow assessment tomorrow to determine whether pt is OK to
   start PO regimen which would be ideal
   - if no PO, would discuss PEG with family
   - defer cardioversion until chemical peumonitis resolves
   - A/C tomorrow will be complicated.
   .
   Chemical Pneumonitis: Pt noted to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR, likely
   chemical pneumonitis from his aspiration event. No leukocytosis is
   noted on lab draw, no fevers. His A. flutter predates his aspiration
   event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his A. flutter. It could be
   a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops into a PNA. Will not
   treat for aspiration PNA given lack of infectious signs. If pt become
   febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis would have a low threshold to put

 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO
   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current
   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to
   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to
   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), chronic GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and ischemic heart disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, and altered mental status. The patient is unable to tolerate oral intake and has been on nothing by mouth (NPO) status since admission. He has a Foley catheter in place, and his vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids and various medications, including diltiazem, morphine sulfate, and TPN/PPN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to tolerate oral intake and the presence of right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of chemical pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection such as fever and leukocytosis is necessary. If the patient becomes febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis, antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia may be required.

2. Atrial flutter: The patient's EKG shows atrial flutter with a rate of 150."

   cardioversion.  Need to determine alternate regimen.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new progressive RLL infiltrate, concern for
   aspiration event.  Low threshold for antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENTION -- relative hypotension for this patient, although
   clinically acceptable (MAP> 65mmHg).  Monitor BP and MAP.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans post transplant for CML. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, which has improved on iv diltiazem drip, pulmonary infiltrates, hypotension, and seizures. The patient is receiving various medications including adenosine, diltiazem, morphine sulfate, and levetiracetam (Keppra).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia was initially controlled with adenosine but required further intervention with a diltiazem drip. The patient's rate is currently controlled, but there is a need to determine an alternate regimen. Potential complications may arise if the heart rhythm cannot be maintained or if the medication causes side effects.

2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has developed new progressive right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, which is a concern for aspiration event. Low threshold for antimicrobials should be considered to prevent or treat any potential infection. Complications may include worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, or pneumonia.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing relative hypotension, although clinically acceptable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg. Close monitoring of blood pressure and MAP is necessary. Complications may arise if the blood pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with RVR. The patient has multiple medical conditions and allergies, including amphotericin B, Ambisome, Campath, heparin agents, and azithromycin, Bactrim, and acyclovir. The patient is on several medications, including diltiazem, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications. The patient complains of upper back pain and dry mouth but denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Review of systems is unchanged from admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 122/63 to 123/67 mmHg, heart rate between 81-86 bpm, respiratory rate of 20-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,481 mL with an output of 825 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,656 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///32/. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic assessment.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 9.6-10.6 K/uL, Hct of 26.0-26.2%, Plt of 281 K/uL, Cr of 1.0-1.2 mg/dL, TropT of 0.02-0.05 ng/mL, TCO2 of 39-45 mg/dL, Glucose of 42-117 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits. The ECG shows typical atrial flutter with a 4:1 block. The patient is diagnosed with atrial flutter, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, and a history of cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial flutter with RVR may progress to atrial fibrillation, leading to an irregular heartbeat, palpitations, and potential complications like stroke or heart failure.
2. Anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Metabolic alkalosis can lead to symptoms such as confusion, muscle twitching, and increased heart rate.
4. Altered mental status may progress to delirium or dementia, affecting the patient's cognitive function and ability to communicate effectively.
5. Alteration in nutrition can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, weakened immune system, and delayed wound healing.
6. History of cancer increases the risk of recurrence, metastasis, and potential complications related to the underlying malignancy.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable, but close monitoring and management of atrial flutter, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, and nutritional status are crucial to prevent potential medical complications."

   .
   NPO STATUS:
   This is a major barrier to all of his treatment issues.  Pt currently
   not tolerating PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing
   with medications/liquids. Will keep him NPO for now with video swallow
   planned for tomorrow AM. As mentioned previously family did not want
   trach placed, NGT also undesirable/impossible given his recent nasal
   intubation, sinusitis. Pt has poor opening of his mouth which would
   make an OGT difficult too. Can consider TPN vs PPN whilst pt is NPO
   however the concern would be whether this would be anything more than a
   short term solution.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] will discuss PEG with the family
   shortly.
   - f/u S&S eval tomorrow.
   - NPO for now
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   PO Diltiazem would be ideal however given he could not tolerate any PO
   meds this AM and he is currently requiring a diltiazem gtt. Speech and
   swallow are aware of him and will see him today. Adenosine EKG shows
   clear A. flutter 2:1 with a rate of 150. t EP consult felt that D/C
   cardioversion would be definitive treatment for A. Flutter, however
   with new pneumonitis would hold off unitl
nidus
 resolves. Further D/C
   Cardioversion is complicated by the difficulty in protecting his airway
   for sedation, and amiodarone is obviously a poor choice given his
   underlying bonchiolitis obliterans.  Pt has h.o. of Heparin allergy. In
   terms of the causes of his A. flutter with [**Name (NI) **] pt recently had an Echo
   performed [**2-6**] which showed no evidence of valvular disease given his
   history ischaemic injury is also low on the differential. Will check
   TSH, T4 level.
   - continue IV diltiazem gtt if pt is persistently in A. flutter with
   [**Month/Day (4) **]
   - Speech & swallow assessment tomorrow to determine whether pt is OK to
   start PO regimen which would be ideal
   - if no PO, would discuss PEG with family
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to discuss ablation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Will need
   bivalirudin if we are considering ablation and wait until tomorrow
   .
   Chemical Pneumonitis: Pt noted to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR, likely
   chemical pneumonitis from his aspiration event. No leukocytosis is
   noted on lab draw, no fevers. His A. flutter predates his aspiration
   event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his A. flutter. It could be
   a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops into a PNA. Will not
   treat for aspiration PNA given lack of infectious signs. If pt become
   febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis would have a low threshold to put
   on abx coverage for aspiration PNA.
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO
   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current
   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to
   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to
   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the
   family they have decided against PEG tubes. NGT would be undesirable
   given his severe sinus disease and recent nasal intubation.
   - f/u S&S tomorrow
   - follow electrolytes
   .
   Acute Kidney Injury
   Suspect pre-renal for the same reason as above.
   -Bolus 1L NS
   .
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on
   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV
   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.
   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper
   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV
   .
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry
   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,
   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral
   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time
   interval would be atypical.
   - will recheck Hct
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Pt was initially admitted with AMS that was thought to be possibly
   seizures given his known temporal lobe mass versus delirium given his
   initial underlying PNA. Since his extubation last week he has remained
   orientated to person, place, time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial flutter. He has a history of cancer, chronic GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing upper back pain, dry mouth, and is unable to tolerate oral intake. He is receiving IV fluids and has been placed on a nasal cannula for oxygen. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but he has a low heart rate. His blood work shows anemia, altered mental status, and metabolic alkalosis. The patient has a history of heparin allergy and is currently receiving bivalirudin and argatroban. He is being evaluated for a possible PEG tube placement due to his inability to tolerate oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonitis: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which could be indicative of chemical pneumonitis from aspiration. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection or worsening respiratory status.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to tolerate oral intake increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for fever, leukocytosis, and worsening respiratory symptoms is essential.
3. Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may require further evaluation and management. Close monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base balance is necessary.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, suggesting"

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   NPO STATUS:
   This is a major barrier to all of his treatment issues.  Pt currently
   not tolerating PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing
   with medications/liquids. Will keep him NPO for now with video swallow
   planned for today. As mentioned previously family did not want trach
   placed, NGT also undesirable/impossible given his recent nasal
   intubation, sinusitis. Pt has poor opening of his mouth which would
   make an OGT difficult too. Can consider TPN vs PPN whilst pt is NPO
   however the concern would be whether this would be anything more than a
   short term solution.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] will discuss PEG with the family and
   patient.
   - f/u S&S eval today
   - NPO for now
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   PO Diltiazem would be ideal however given he could not tolerate any PO
   meds this AM and he is currently requiring a diltiazem gtt. Speech and
   swallow are aware of him and will see him today. Adenosine EKG shows
   clear A. flutter 2:1 with a rate of 150. t EP consult felt that D/C
   cardioversion would be definitive treatment for A. Flutter, however
   with new pneumonitis would hold off unitl
nidus
 resolves. Further D/C
   Cardioversion is complicated by the difficulty in protecting his airway
   for sedation, and amiodarone is obviously a poor choice given his
   underlying bonchiolitis obliterans.  Pt has h.o. of Heparin allergy. In
   terms of the causes of his A. flutter with [**Name (NI) **] pt recently had an Echo
   performed [**2-6**] which showed no evidence of valvular disease given his
   history ischaemic injury is also low on the differential.
   - continue IV diltiazem gtt if pt is persistently in A. flutter with
   [**Month/Day (4) **]
   - Speech & swallow assessment today to determine whether pt is OK to
   start PO regimen which would be ideal
   - if no PO, would discuss PEG with family
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to discuss ablation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Started
   agratroban in anticipation of possible ablation
   .
   >  Chemical Pneumonitis: Pt noted to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR,
   likely chemical pneumonitis from his aspiration event. No leukocytosis
   is noted on lab draw, no fevers. His A. flutter predates his aspiration
   event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his A. flutter. It could be
   a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops into a PNA. Will not
   treat for aspiration PNA given lack of infectious signs. If pt become
   febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis would have a low threshold to put
   on abx coverage for aspiration PNA.
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO
   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current
   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to
   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to
   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the
   family they have decided against PEG tubes. NGT would be undesirable
   given his severe sinus disease and recent nasal intubation.
   - f/u S&S today
   - follow electrolytes
   .
   >  Renal Insufficiency
   Suspect pre-renal for the same reason as above.  Now resolved
   -Bolus 1L NS
   .
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on
   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV
   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.
   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper
   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV
   .
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry
   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,
   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral
   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time
   interval would be atypical.  B12 level normal
   - follow Hct
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Pt was initially admitted with AMS that was thought to be possibly
   seizures given his known temporal lobe mass versus delirium given his
   initial underlying PNA. Since his extubation last week he has remained
   orientated to person, place, time.

   .
   NPO STATUS:
   This is a major barrier to all of his treatment issues.  Pt currently
   not tolerating PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing
   with medications/liquids. Will keep him NPO for now with video swallow
   planned for today. As mentioned previously family did not want trach
   placed, NGT also undesirable/impossible given his recent nasal
   intubation, sinusitis. Pt has poor opening of his mouth which would
   make an OGT difficult too. Can consider TPN vs PPN whilst pt is NPO
   however the concern would be whether this would be anything more than a
   short term solution.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] will discuss PEG with the family and
   patient.
   - f/u S&S eval today
   - NPO for now
   - will need to revisit nutrition, PEG vs TPN/PPN vs PO intake, pending
   video swallow eval
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   PO Diltiazem would be ideal however given he could not tolerate any PO
   meds this AM and he is currently requiring a diltiazem gtt. Speech and
   swallow are aware of him and will see him today. Adenosine EKG shows
   clear A. flutter 2:1 with a rate of 150. t EP consult felt that D/C
   cardioversion would be definitive treatment for A. Flutter, however
   with new pneumonitis would hold off unitl
nidus
 resolves. Further D/C
   Cardioversion is complicated by the difficulty in protecting his airway
   for sedation, and amiodarone is obviously a poor choice given his
   underlying bonchiolitis obliterans.  Pt has h.o. of Heparin allergy. In
   terms of the causes of his A. flutter with [**Name (NI) **] pt recently had an Echo
   performed [**2-6**] which showed no evidence of valvular disease given his
   history ischaemic injury is also low on the differential.
   - continue IV diltiazem gtt if pt is persistently in A. flutter with
   [**Month/Day (4) **] -> will decrease dilt gtt and start lopressor 2.5 mg IV Q6 in
   attempt to wean off dilt gtt
   - Speech & swallow assessment today to determine whether pt is OK to
   start PO regimen which would be ideal
   - if no PO, would discuss PEG with family
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to discuss ablation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Started
   agratroban in anticipation of possible ablation
   .
   >  Chemical Pneumonitis: Pt noted to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR,
   likely chemical pneumonitis from his aspiration event. No leukocytosis
   is noted on lab draw, no fevers. His A. flutter predates his aspiration
   event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his A. flutter. It could be
   a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops into a PNA. Will not
   treat for aspiration PNA given lack of infectious signs. If pt become
   febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis would have a low threshold to put
   on abx coverage for aspiration PNA.
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO
   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current
   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to
   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to
   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the
   family they have decided against PEG tubes. NGT would be undesirable
   given his severe sinus disease and recent nasal intubation.
   - f/u S&S today
   - follow electrolytes

   >  Renal Insufficiency
   Suspect pre-renal for the same reason as above.  Now resolved
   -Bolus 1L NS
   .
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on
   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV
   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.
   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper
   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV
   .
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry
   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,
   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral
   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time
   interval would be atypical.  B12 level normal
   - follow Hct
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Pt was initially admitted with AMS that was thought to be possibly
   seizures given his known temporal lobe mass versus delirium given his
   initial underlying PNA. Since his extubation last week he has remained
   orientated to person, place, time.
   - cont to monitor patient for signs of AMS

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial flutter. The patient has a history of cancer, chronic GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and is currently on IV medications including diltiazem, morphine sulfate, and others. He is also receiving bivalirudin/argatroban to buy time for a possible ablation procedure. The patient's nutrition is a major concern as he is not tolerating oral intake and has marginal urine output. A video swallow test is planned today to assess his ability to tolerate oral intake. The patient's altered mental status is being closely monitored, and he has an ongoing right pleural effusion. His labs indicate anemia, metabolic alkalosis, and potential renal insufficiency. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's difficulty in tolerating oral intake and the presence of a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest a possible aspiration event leading to chemical pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection and respiratory distress is necessary.
2. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's recent history of poor oral intake may lead to electrolyte disturbances such as metabolic alkalosis and potential pre-renal renal insufficiency. Ongoing monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   TACHYCARDIA -- increased from baseline tachycardia (100-120).
   Relatively asymptomatic.  Rate controlled now with Diltiazem drip -->
   EP consultation following.  Discussion currently supports
   defibrillation or ablation.  Chemical treatment limited by inability to
   take PO regimen at this time.  Cardiac echo performed this AM --> await
   results.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new progressive RLL infiltrate, concern for
   aspiration event.  Monitor off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for
   antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENTION -- relative hypotension for this patient, although
   clinically acceptable (MAP> 65mmHg).  Monitor BP and MAP.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.
   FLUIDS -- net volume replete, now expanded.  Plan to resume diuresis.
   Plan 0.5 L net negative.   Monitor I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Speech/Swallow to evaluation poor/inadequate
   --> video swallow study.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to consider PEG (likely surgical
   will be require) if unable to reliably take po
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   TACHYCARDIA -- increased from baseline tachycardia (100-120).
   Relatively asymptomatic.  Rate controlled now with Diltiazem drip -->
   EP consultation following.  Discussion currently supports
   defibrillation or ablation.  Chemical treatment limited by inability to
   take PO regimen at this time.  Cardiac echo performed this AM --> await
   results.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new progressive RLL infiltrate, concern for
   aspiration event.  Monitor off antimicrobials.  Low threshold for
   antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENTION -- relative hypotension for this patient, although
   clinically acceptable (MAP> 65mmHg).  Monitor BP and MAP.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.
   FLUIDS -- net volume replete, now expanded.  Plan to resume diuresis.
   Plan 0.5 L net negative.   Monitor I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Speech/Swallow to evaluation poor/inadequate
   --> video swallow study.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to consider PEG (likely surgical
   will be require) if unable to reliably take po
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They are currently in the ICU and have a chief complaint of tachycardia. The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is being controlled with diltiazem drip. They are also planned to initiate argatroban this morning in anticipation of ablation treatment for a-flutter. The patient remains NPO (nothing by mouth).

The patient's allergies include amphotericin B, Ambisome (Intraven.), Campath (Intraven.), and heparin agents. Their recent antibiotic doses were azithromycin on 02/25 at 05:19 PM, Bactrim (SMX/TMP) on 02/26 at 03:18 PM, and acyclovir on 02/26 at 08:00 PM.

Infusions include diltiazem at 10 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include morphine sulfate, administered on 02/27 at 05:00 AM. The patient has several ongoing medical conditions, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), GVHD (graft-versus-host disease), and bronchiolitis obliterans.

Review of systems is negative for any significant symptoms, except for fatigue and a history of atrial flutter. The patient has no recent weight loss, chest pain, palpitations, edema, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.

   24 Hour Events:
   - after extensive discussions all around, no ablation, did not give
   argatroban
   - failed video swallow [**3-11**] diffuse muscle weakness and delayed all
   phases of swallowing, thought is this represents general deconditioning
   (per [**Doctor Last Name 1750**], not really asked to S&S) and maybe giving temporary
   nutrition could bridge to improved swallowing
   - [**Doctor Last Name 1750**] discussed G-tube as this ""bridge,"" pt just wants to
   eat..unclear what will happen but gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] to see pt and eval if even
   decent PEG candidate given skin issues
   - held off Lasix since pt very dry and thirsty, extremely uncomfortable
   all day with diffuse pain requiring frequent morphine
   - titrated up metoprolol, 2.5 to 5 to 10, minimal response, at 15,

   Assessment and Plan
   NPO STATUS:
   This is a major barrier to all of his treatment issues.  Pt currently
   not tolerating PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing
   with medications/liquids. Video swallow shows diffuse weakness.Surgical
   evaluation for PEG today, which will require another discussion with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] after. Would be in favor of  PPN as a short term solution.
   - NPO for now
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   PO Diltiazem would be ideal however given he could not tolerate any PO
   meds this AM and he is currently requiring a diltiazem gtt. Speech and
   swallow are aware of him and will see him today. Adenosine EKG shows
   clear A. flutter 2:1 with a rate of 150. t EP consult felt that D/C
   cardioversion would be definitive treatment for A. Flutter, however
   with new pneumonitis would hold off unitl
nidus
 resolves. Further D/C
   Cardioversion is complicated by the difficulty in protecting his airway
   for sedation, and amiodarone is obviously a poor choice given his
   underlying bonchiolitis obliterans.  Pt has h.o. of Heparin allergy. In
   terms of the causes of his A. flutter with [**Name (NI) **] pt recently had an Echo
   performed [**2-6**] which showed no evidence of valvular disease given his
   history ischaemic injury is also low on the differential.
   - would restart IV diltiazem gtt if pt is persistently in A. flutter
   with [**Month/Day (4) **] -> will try intermittent Dilt
   - Need PEG to start oral dilt
   - No ablation
   .
   >  Aspiration Pneumonia: Pt noted to have a persistnet/increasing RLL
   infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated white count.  His A. flutter
   predates his aspiration event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his
   A. flutter. It could be a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops
   into a PNA. At this point, given our previously stated low threshold
   would start abx.
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO
   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current
   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to
   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to
   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the
   family they have decided against PEG tubes. NGT would be undesirable
   given his severe sinus disease and recent nasal intubation.

 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of cancer, chronic GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and previous ischemic injury. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been unable to tolerate oral intake and has shown diffuse muscle weakness and delayed phases of swallowing during a video swallow test. There are concerns about the patient's ability to protect his airway during sedation for cardioversion. The patient has atrial flutter with a rate of 150, and it is uncertain whether it is causing his symptoms or if it is a result of his underlying conditions. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to recent poor oral intake, and acute renal insufficiency, possibly caused by dehydration. There are ongoing discussions about the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or a temporary feeding tube due to the patient's difficulty with swallowing. The patient's anemia is being evaluated, and he is receiving IV methylprednisolone for chronic GVHD and prednisone equivalent for bronchiolitis obliterans. He is also on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to tolerate oral intake and the presence of diffuse muscle weakness and delayed swallowing"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypercarbic Respiratory failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:    This morning
   Mr [**Known lastname 11322**] was noted to be in respiratory distress, somnolent,
   desaturating to the 80
s.  A VBG was performed (by accident) which
   revealed a pH of 7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to
   intubate and anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.
   The differential includes worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash
   pulmonary edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to
   have a persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated
   white count, making pneumonia the most likely explanation.    PE is
   lower on our differential given the absence of tachypnea and more
   likely explanation.  Would be reluctant to perform CTA as creatinine is
   rising, he is a terrible candidate for v/q scan, will check LENI
   CXR is not c/w flash.
   .
   - Start Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl for hospital acquired/aspiration/VAP (per
   abx approval recs)
   - f/u LENI
   - Nasally intubated
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] to readress trach, as it may be necessary in the future
   .
   Hypotension:  Coincided with restarting dilt and the intubation, though
   no agents were used.  Rapidly resolved with 1l NS, and neo, which is
   currently off.  Will treat as septic/peri-septic for now and be liberal
   with IVF if necessary.
   - Bolus PRN
   .
   NPO STATUS:
   This is a major barrier to all of his treatment issues.  While an OG
   tube is in place this is a temporary fix.  Pt currently not tolerating
   PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing with
   medications/liquids. Video swallow shows diffuse weakness.Surgical
   evaluation for PEG today, which will require another discussion with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] after.  Tube feeds for now.
   - surgery to eval for G-Tube
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with RVR
   Currently well rate controlled with no meds, now that we have an OG,
   would start with low dose oral dilt.
   - oral dilt PRN
   .
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis/compensatory metabolic alkalosis given his
   recent history of poor PO intake and marked CO2 retention. His
   Creatinine is 1.5, which is elevated. Pt currently receiving NS IVF
   given his low BP. Will continue to monitor I/Os, and now starting
   tubefeeds.  G-tube must be discussed.
   - follow electrolytes
   .
   >  Acute Renal Insufficiency
   Likely pre-renal, will f/u urine lytes.
   .
   - bolusing as above
   - tubefeeds should help
   .
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on
   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV
   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.
   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper
   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV
   .
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry
   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,
   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral
   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time
   interval would be atypical.  B12 level normal. HCT of 29 today likely
   represents volume contraction.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. There is also a possibility of pulmonary edema and pulmonary embolism.

2. Kidney dysfunction: The patient has acute renal insufficiency with an elevated creatinine level of 1.5. This could be due to pre-renal causes or intrinsic renal damage.

3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which is likely caused by poor oral intake and CO2 retention.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia with a Hct of 19. It is important to evaluate the cause of anemia and consider potential bleeding events.

5. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension coinciding with restarting diltiazem and intubation. This may be related to septic or peri-septic shock.

6. Malnutrition: The patient is unable to tolerate oral intake, and there is a major barrier to nutrition. Temporary feeding through an OG tube has been implemented, but long-term nutritional support through a G-tube needs to be discussed.

7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient requires close monitoring of electrolytes due to recent history of poor oral intake, marked CO2 retention, and the use of IV fluids.

8. Cancer and associated complications: The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), chronic GV"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management).  Consider
   pulmonary embolism (new recent tachycardia).  Plan CT scan (consider
   CTA), consider bronchoscopy to inspect airway patency.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation, sample respiratory tract secretions, monitor
   ABG.  Will need to initiate discussions with family to proceed with
   tracheostomy tube if acceptable to patient.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  Doubt primary
   cardiac (intrinsic ishcemia, valvular heart disease or dyrhythmia).
   Await cardiac echo results (? RV dysfuction), monitor ECG and cardiac
   enzymes.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem, then lopressor.
   Currently off diltiazem and lopressor while hypotensive.  Hope to
   resume chemical control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new progressive RLL infiltrate, suspect
   aspiration event --> now likely aspiration pneumonia.  Plan broad
   antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Has been NPO.  Plan OGT/NGT and initiate  TF.
   Plan to evaluate for PEG (likely surgical rather than percutaneous).
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they have been experiencing progressive recurrent tachycardia throughout the morning. The patient exhibited somnolence and required intubation during AM rounds due to hypotension. The patient's history is limited as they are sedated and have an endotracheal tube in place.

The patient's allergies include amphotericin B, Ambisome (Intraven.), and Campath (Intraven.). They have received various antibiotics including Bactrim, Azithromycin, and Acyclovir. The patient is currently on several medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), metoprolol, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's review of systems is negative for fever, weight loss, and other constitutional symptoms. They also do not have any respiratory complaints such as cough or shortness of breath. The patient's cardiovascular system is negative for chest pain or palpitations, but they do have tachycardia. There are no significant findings in the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, or neurologic systems.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 74/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of chronic obstructive lung disease"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated due to progressive recurrent tachycardia, hypotension, and significant clinical decline. There are multiple potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing ventilatory failure, which is a severe complication of respiratory failure. This may be attributed to evolving right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration) and possibly pulmonary embolism.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. Tachycardia: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The tachycardia is currently being managed with Diltiazem and Lopressor. The goal is to resume chemical control of the heart rate.

4. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient has new progressive right lower lobe infiltrate, which is suspected to be aspiration pneumonia. Broad antimicrobials are being administered to cover for healthcare-associated community pathogens (HCAP).

5. Seizures: The patient has had transient mental status changes, which could indicate partial complex seizures. Continuous EEG is recommended to monitor for any seizure activity, and further neurological consultation may be needed.

6. Fluid management: The"

   Hypercarbic Respiratory failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:   On [**2-28**] Mr
   [**Known lastname 11322**] was noted to be in respiratory distress, somnolent,
   desaturating to the 80
s.  A VBG was performed (by accident) which
   revealed a pH of 7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to
   intubate and anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.
   The differential includes worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash
   pulmonary edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to
   have a persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated
   white count, making pneumonia the most likely explanation.    PE is
   lower on our differential given the absence of tachypnea and more
   likely explanation.  Would be reluctant to perform CTA as creatinine is
   rising, he is a terrible candidate for v/q scan, will check LENI
   CXR is not c/w flash.

   sounds like plan is to t him up as much as possible get him off the
   vent, and make him DNR/DNI
   .
   .
   Nutrition/refeeding:
   An OG tube is in place and is a temporary fix.  Pt currently not
   tolerating PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing with
   medications/liquids. Video swallow shows diffuse weakness.Surgical
   evaluation for PEG today, which will require another discussion with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] after.  Tube feeds for now with [**Hospital1 **] lytes for refeeding
   syndrome. Liberal phosphate and thiamine.
   - surgery to eval for G-Tube

    Hypotension:  Resolved
   - Bolus PRN
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with RVR
   Currently well rate controlled with no meds, now that we have an OG,
   would start with low dose oral dilt.
   - doing well on oral dilt
   .
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis/compensatory metabolic alkalosis given his
   recent history of poor PO intake and marked CO2 retention. His
   Creatinine is 1.5, which is elevated. Pt currently receiving NS IVF
   given his low BP. Will continue to monitor I/Os, and now starting
   tubefeeds.  G-tube must be discussed.
   - follow electrolytes
   .
   >  ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY
   Likely pre-renal, will f/u urine lytes.
   .
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on
   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV
   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.
   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper
   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV
   .
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry
   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,
   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral
   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time
   interval would be atypical.  B12 level normal. HCT of 29 today likely
   represents volume contraction.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cancer, chronic GVHD, and bronchiolitis obliterans. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several interventions including nasally intubated, re-intubation for respiratory distress, and empiric treatment for aspiration pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/65 mmHg to 120/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.5. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's recent events include worsening respiratory distress, somnolence, desaturation to the 80s, and a VBG revealing pH of 7.14 and PCO2 >110. These findings led to the decision of intubation. The differential diagnosis includes worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism. However, given the absence of tachypnea and the presence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, pneumonia is considered the most likely explanation. The patient"

   Hypercarbic Respiratory failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:    This morning
   Mr [**Known lastname 11322**] was noted to be in respiratory distress, somnolent,
   desaturating to the 80
s.  A VBG was performed (by accident) which
   revealed a pH of 7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to
   intubate and anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.
   The differential includes worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash
   pulmonary edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to
   have a persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated
   white count, making pneumonia the most likely explanation.    PE is
   lower on our differential given the absence of tachypnea and more
   likely explanation.  Would be reluctant to perform CTA as creatinine is
   rising, he is a terrible candidate for v/q scan, will check LENI
   CXR is not c/w flash.

   Hypotension:  Coincided with restarting dilt and the intubation, though
   no agents were used.  Rapidly resolved with 1l NS, and neo, which is
   currently off.  Will treat as septic/peri-septic for now and be liberal
   with IVF if necessary.

   NPO STATUS:
   This is a major barrier to all of his treatment issues.  While an OG
   tube is in place this is a temporary fix.  Pt currently not tolerating
   PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing with
   medications/liquids. Video swallow shows diffuse weakness.Surgical
   evaluation for PEG today, which will require another discussion with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] after.  Tube feeds for now.

 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Likely contraction alkalosis/compensatory metabolic alkalosis given his
   recent history of poor PO intake and marked CO2 retention. His
   Creatinine is 1.5, which is elevated. Pt currently receiving NS IVF
   given his low BP. Will continue to monitor I/Os, and now starting
   tubefeeds.  G-tube must be discussed.

   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on
   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV
   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.
   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper
   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV

 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission
   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry
   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,
   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral
   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time
   interval would be atypical.  B12 level normal. HCT of 29 today likely
   represents volume contraction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress this morning, leading to re-intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The initial differential diagnosis included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism. However, pneumonia seems to be the most likely explanation due to a persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and an elevated white blood cell count.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension coincided with restarting diltiazem and intubation. It rapidly resolved with 1 liter of normal saline and neo, which is currently off. The hypotension will be treated as septic/peri-septic for now, and the patient will be given IV fluids as needed.

3. NPO Status: The patient is currently not tolerating oral intake and has been experiencing increased coughing with medications/liquids. A temporary fix is an OG tube, but a surgical evaluation for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is necessary. The patient also requires another discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] regarding tube feeds and possible surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. It is well rate-controlled with no medications at the moment. Oral diltiazem will"

 ETT in place (a bit high but in as far as possible), stable to
   improved R basilar infiltrate, bilateral pleural effusions, stable
   retrocardiac opacity.
   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Baseline has
   severe bronchiolitis obliterans.  Intubated, markedly improved.  Will
   aim to adjust MV to achieve goal PCO2 of ~60-70 w/stable pH.  Acute
   decompensation likely due to continued aspiration and decreased
   clearance of secretions, but will continue antibiotics for 8 day
   course.
   - Antibiotics for HAP for 8days
   - Chest PT, suctioning as needed
   - Adjust minute ventilation for goal PCO2 of 60-70
   - In discussion with family and BMT, plan will likely be to optimize
   respiratory status and aim to extubate and not reintubate
 ATRIAL FLUTTER with RVR
 Improved rate on dilt gtt, now has oral
   access so transitioned to oral diltiazem.  Had discussed ablation or
   cardioversion but will hold off for now.
   - Oral dilt for rate control
   - No anticoagulation for now
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Exact etiology unclear, possibly due to
   radiation gliosis and seizures.  On empiric Keppra, sedation as needed
   for comfort.
   - PRN fent, morphine for pain
   - PRN versed for agitation
   - Keppra for possible seizures
 Decreased NUTRITION
 Has had poor nutrition for >1 month.  Now w/OG
   tube and started on tube feeds.  Family prefers no PEG, but had marked
   aspiration on video swallow.
   - Tube feeds, monitor for refeeding syndrome
   - Now with oral access, so will change what we can to oral route
 HYPOTENSION
 Occurred in the setting of intubation, aflutter w/RVR,
   and restarting dilt gtt.  Improved w/IVF, no resolved.
   - Monitor BP, will try for A line
 .H/O CML and Sarcoma
 S/p BMT for CML in [**2147**], sarcoma s/p resection
   and XRT.  C/b GVH and not tolerating anti-rejection meds.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient also had a history of sarcoma and received resection and radiation therapy. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), altered mental status, decreased nutrition, hypotension, and a history of CML and sarcoma. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation to support their breathing. Antibiotics have been started for possible aspiration pneumonia, and tube feeds have been initiated due to poor nutrition. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Chest X-ray reveals an endotracheal tube in place, stable right basal infiltrate, and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's medical team is discussing goals of care, including optimizing respiratory status and aiming for extubation without reintubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation due to severe bronchiolitis obliterans and ongoing aspiration.
2. Worsening respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest.
3. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Recurrent episodes of atrial flutter with RVR, potentially requiring cardioversion or ablation.
5. Refeeding syndrome due to reint"

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Baseline has
   severe bronchiolitis obliterans.  Intubated, markedly improved.  Will
   aim to adjust MV to achieve goal PCO2 of ~60-70 w/stable pH.  Acute
   decompensation likely due to continued aspiration and decreased
   clearance of secretions, but will continue antibiotics for 8 day
   course.
   - Antibiotics for HAP for 8days
   - Chest PT, suctioning as needed
   - Adjust minute ventilation for goal PCO2 of 60-70
   - In discussion with family and BMT, plan will likely be to optimize
   respiratory status and aim to extubate and not reintubate
 ATRIAL FLUTTER with RVR
 Improved rate on dilt gtt, now has oral
   access so transitioned to oral diltiazem.  Had discussed ablation or
   cardioversion but will hold off for now.
   - Oral dilt for rate control
   - No anticoagulation for now
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Exact etiology unclear, possibly due to
   radiation gliosis and seizures.  On empiric Keppra, sedation as needed
   for comfort.
   - PRN fent, morphine for pain
   - PRN versed for agitation
   - Keppra for possible seizures
 Decreased NUTRITION
 Has had poor nutrition for >1 month.  Now w/OG
   tube and started on tube feeds.  Family prefers no PEG, but had marked
   aspiration on video swallow.
   - Tube feeds, monitor for refeeding syndrome
   - Now with oral access, so will change what we can to oral route
 HYPOTENSION
 Occurred in the setting of intubation, aflutter w/RVR,
   and restarting dilt gtt.  Improved w/IVF, no resolved.
   - Monitor BP, will try for A line
 .H/O CML and Sarcoma
 S/p BMT for CML in [**2147**], sarcoma s/p resection
   and XRT.  C/b GVH and not tolerating anti-rejection meds.

   revealed a pH of 7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to
   intubate and anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.
   The differential includes worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash
   pulmonary edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to
   have a persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated
   white count, making pneumonia the most likely explanation.    PE is

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cancer, chronic GVHD, and bronchiolitis obliterans. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Vanc, Cefepime, and Flagyl. He is also on fentanyl and midazolam infusions for sedation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 98/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and has a right lower extremity edema. The patient's arterial blood gases reveal a pH of 7.43, PCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PO2 of 328 mmHg. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and creatinine level. The patient's sputum gram stain indicates the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and budding yeast. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as respiratory distress and elevated white blood cell count, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs on the sputum gram stain further supports this possibility."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic bronchiolitis obliterans, clear aspiration on video swallow, and markedly hypercarbic requiring intubation. They are also experiencing atrial flutter with RVR, abdominal distension, malnutrition, hypotension, a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and sarcoma post bone marrow transplant (BMT), and an allergy to heparin products. Additionally, the patient has altered mental status but is currently fine on minimal sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures have been taken to prevent VAP, including the use of chlorhexidine and elevating the head of bed.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylaxis with pneumatic compression boots has been initiated.

3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bloodstream infections.

4. Delirium or ICU psychosis: The patient's altered mental status and prolonged sedation may predispose them to delirium or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is flutter and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic bronchiolitis obliterans, aspiration on video swallow, and markedly hypercarbic requiring intubation. They have been improving rapidly on the ventilator and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's atrial flutter with RVR is being managed with oral diltiazem and they are not opting for ablation at this point.

The patient also has abdominal distension, which is more marked today with minimal but small amounts of stool. The plan is to check the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) and consider an enema or increasing the bowel regimen if there is no obstruction. The patient is malnourished and was started on tube feeds three days ago. They will be monitored for electrolyte imbalances related to refeeding.

Additionally, the patient experienced hypotension briefly in the setting of atrial flutter, hypercarbia, and intubation, but recovered with intravenous fluids (IVF). The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65. The patient has a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and sarcoma, post bone marrow transplant (BMT), with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and obliterative bronchiolitis. They are on low-dose prednisone and input from the BMT team is appreciated.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 Has chronic bronchiolitis
   obliterans, clear aspiration on video swallow, markedly hypercarbic
   requiring intubation.  Improved rapidly on vent, started on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Has been mildly positive so will try to optimize
   volume status
   - 8 day course of antibiotics for aspiration/HAP
   - Trial on PSV today, follow gas.  Goal PCO2 ~60
   - Try gentle diuresis, goal [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1335**] cc negative today
 ATRIAL FLUTTER w/RVR
 Over to oral dilt, doing well on current
   dose.  No anticoagulation at this point, and not opting for ablation.
   - Dilt, titrate as needed
 Abdominal distension
 More marked today, minimal but small amounts
   of stool.
   - Check KUB
   - Consider enema, increasing bowel regimen
  MALNUORISHED
 Finally started on tube feeds three days ago

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic bronchiolitis obliterans, acute respiratory failure, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and malnutrition. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's 24-hour events include the placement of an arterial line, reduction in minute ventilation, and administration of various medications including antibiotics, analgesics, sedatives, and diuretics.

His vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate 89 bpm (with a range of 88-108 bpm), blood pressure 98/57 mmHg (with a range of 70-127/50-92 mmHg), respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute (with a range of 0-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 99% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance at 35 cmH2O/mL. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 52 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) 32 mEq/L, oxygen saturation (SaO2) 99%, and base excess (BE) -9 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, endotracheal and orogastric tubes in place, diminished breath sounds at the right lung base, firm and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and neurologic examination consistent with sedation and intubation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.0 x 10^9/L (with a range of 9.3-9.6 x 10^9/L), elevated hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.5 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 298 x 10^9/L (with a range of 224-210 x 10^9/L), elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL (with a range of 1.4-1.5 mg/dL), elevated total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 41 mmHg (with a range of 32-36 mmHg), and elevated blood glucose level of 138 mg/dL (with a range of 85-129 mg/dL).

Radiology findings include a chest X-ray showing an endotracheal tube in place"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. Hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory distress and intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition is characterized by increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood. The patient's VBG (venous blood gas) revealed a pH of 7.14 and a PCO2 >110, indicating severe respiratory acidosis. The patient was intubated, and the differential diagnosis included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism (PE).

2. Atrial flutter with RVR (rapid ventricular response): The patient is currently well rate-controlled with PO diltiazem for atrial flutter. Atrial flutter is a type of supraventricular tachycardia where the atria contract at a rapid rate, leading to an irregular ventricular response.

3. Anemia, other: The patient has stable hematocrit levels but may have been hemoconcentrated upon transfer to the ICU. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the anemia.

4. Alkalosis, metabolic: The patient likely has compensatory metabolic alkalosis due to recent history of marked CO2 retention. This can be supported by the patient's elevated serum bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels and low serum chloride (Cl-) levels. The patient's creatinine level of"

   differential included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary
   edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to have a
   persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated white

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of malignant neoplasm and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure and atrial flutter with RVR. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress, somnolence, and desaturation.

The patient's initial differential diagnosis included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the absence of tachypnea and the presence of a persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray make aspiration pneumonia the most likely explanation. A CT angiogram (CTA) was not performed due to the patient's poor candidacy for the procedure.

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl for hospital-acquired, aspiration, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to support the patient on the ventilator as much as possible and make him do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) with no tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's wife does not want a PEG at this time.

The patient has an ongoing problem with nutrition and is currently receiving tube feeding through an orogastric (OG) tube. However, he is not tolerating oral intake, and a video swallow study showed diffuse weakness. The patient's current"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on background of
   extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation,
   monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor ABG.  Hopefully will be
   able to demonstrate clinical response to pneumonia, and hope to work
   towards extubation.   No plans to proceed with trach if unable to
   extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem, then lopressor.
   Currently off diltiazem and lopressor while hypotensive.  Hope to
   resume chemical control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new progressive RLL infiltrate, suspect
   aspiration event --> now likely aspiration pneumonia.  Plan broad
   antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of advanced lung disease and is suspected to have developed pneumonia due to aspiration. The patient's blood pressure is low, and they have an elevated heart rate. There are new pulmonary infiltrates seen on imaging, indicating possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient experienced seizures, but no motor seizure was observed. They have hypovolemia and require fluid expansion. The patient is tolerating tube feeding well and is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. The patient has a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans after a stem cell transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure can worsen if they do not respond to treatment or develop further complications.
2. Pneumonia: The suspected aspiration pneumonia could progress and lead to severe lung infection, requiring additional interventions such as antibiotics and possibly bronchoscopy.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor organ perfusion and can lead to organ dysfunction if not corrected.
4. Tachycardia: The elevated heart rate may be a compensatory mechanism for hypotension, but if left uncontrolled, it could increase the risk of arrhythmias.
5. Seizures: Although no motor seizure was"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on background of
   extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation,
   monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor ABG.  Hopefully will be
   able to demonstrate clinical response to pneumonia, and hope to work
   towards extubation.   No plans to proceed with trach if unable to
   extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem, then lopressor.
   Currently off diltiazem and lopressor while hypotensive.  Hope to
   resume chemical control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new progressive RLL infiltrate, suspect
   aspiration event --> now likely aspiration pneumonia.  Plan broad
   antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, primarily due to ventilatory failure caused by evolving right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration), potentially related to narcotic use for pain management. The patient also has hypotension, tachycardia, and pulmonary infiltrates. Other medical conditions include chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans following a stem cell transplant for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and continued monitoring are planned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to evolving right lower lobe pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia may be a concern due to the use of narcotics for pain management. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed (HOB) and stress ulcer prophylaxis are being implemented to reduce the risk.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Fluid resuscitation is planned to address hypovolemia.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has atrial fibrillation"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's respiratory distress and desaturation led to the decision to intubate and perform mechanical ventilation.
- The differential diagnosis included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- Aspiration pneumonia was considered the most likely explanation due to a persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and elevated white blood cell count.
- The patient has chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans.
- The patient is currently well rate-controlled with oral diltiazem for atrial flutter.
- The patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to a poor long-term prognosis.
- The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely compensatory, and acute renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal.
- The patient has dependent edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
- The plan is to follow electrolytes and ABGs, replete with KCl, and administer IV Lasix as needed to achieve negative fluid balance.
- Renal dosing of medications will be considered.
- The patient has a history of malignancy and is being treated with chemotherapy.
- The patient has anemia and is receiving blood transfusions.

   [**Known lastname 11322**] was noted to be in respiratory distress, somnolent,
   desaturating to the 80
s.  A VBG was performed which revealed a pH of
   7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to intubate and
   anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.   The
   differential included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary
   edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to have a
   persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated white
   count, making aspiration pneumonia the most likely explanation.    PE
   is lower on our differential given the absence of tachypnea and more
   likely explanation.  LENI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of cancer, chronic GVHD, and bronchiolitis obliterans. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, somnolence, and desaturation to the 80s. A VBG revealed a pH of 7.14 and a PCO2 >110, leading to the decision to intubate. The differential diagnosis included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism (PE). The absence of tachypnea and a more likely explanation for the respiratory distress makes PE lower on the differential. An elevated white count and increasing right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR suggest aspiration pneumonia as the most likely cause. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His ABG shows a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 32, and HCO3- of 24 mEq/L. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 98/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has a history of allergies to amphotericin B, Ambisome, and heparin agents. 

The patient is receiving various medications, including midazol"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on background of
   extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation,
   monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor ABG.  Hopefully will be
   able to demonstrate clinical response to pneumonia, and hope to work
   towards extubation.   No plans to proceed with trach if unable to
   extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem.  Continue chemical
   control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL infiltrate, treated as aspiration
   pneumonia.  Plan broad antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently intubated in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is suspected to be multifactorial and attributed to evolving right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration), possibly compounded by narcotic use for pain management, on a background of extensive advanced lung disease. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 127 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/57 mmHg to 116/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a history of cancer (CML) and has undergone a transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 421 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance index of 148, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, cervical lymphadenopathy within normal limits, cardiovascular examination showing a normal point of maximal impulse and S1 and S2 heart sounds, peripheral vascular examination showing bilateral"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on background of
   extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation,
   monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor ABG.  Hopefully will be
   able to demonstrate clinical response to pneumonia, and hope to work
   towards extubation.   No plans to proceed with trach if unable to
   extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem.  Continue chemical
   control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL infiltrate, treated as aspiration
   pneumonia.  Plan broad antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, primarily caused by ventilatory failure. The underlying factors contributing to this condition include evolving right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration), potential narcotic use for pain management, and extensive advanced lung disease. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The medical team plans to monitor respiratory tract secretions and ABG levels while hoping for a clinical response to pneumonia and working towards extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires ongoing mechanical ventilation support. Complications related to ventilator dependence, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma, need to be closely monitored and managed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has RLL infiltrates suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. It is crucial to promptly identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Failure to treat pneumonia adequately can lead to worsening respiratory status and potentially result in sepsis.

3. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension but has since resolved. However, close monitoring of blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is necessary to maintain adequate perfusion. If hypotension recurs, further evaluation and management, including fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, may be required.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Diltiazem is being used to control heart"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cancer, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress, somnolence, desaturation to the 80s, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, elevated white count, and is not a candidate for CTA due to poor prognosis. The decision was made to intubate, and the patient is currently well-controlled with PO diltiazem for rate control. Goals of care include discussing terminal extubation, no tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and likely going home with hospice. Pain management will be provided through a midline for pain medication, but no active rate control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory distress, somnolence, desaturation, and a VBG revealing pH 7.14 and PCO2 >110. These findings suggest hypercarbic respiratory failure. The presence of a persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and elevated white count further supports the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to further deterioration of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with diffuse discomfort and pain in the buttocks. The patient has a history of malignancy and is experiencing respiratory distress, desaturation, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to worsening aspiration pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current vital signs show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 552 mL over 24 hours. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, increased creatinine level, and low potassium level. Other lab results indicate possible metabolic alkalosis and acute renal insufficiency. 

The patient's goals of care include terminal extubation without tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and going home with hospice. The family does not want active rate control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, chronic graft-versus-host disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, and acute renal failure. 

The patient is currently receiving various medications including lasix, heparin agents, cefepime, vancomycin, metronidazole, pantoprazole, fentanyl, midazolam, and others.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on background of
   extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation,
   monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor ABG.  Hopefully will be
   able to demonstrate clinical response to pneumonia, and hope to work
   towards extubation.   No plans to proceed with trach if unable to
   extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem.  Continue chemical
   control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL infiltrate, treated as aspiration
   pneumonia.  Plan broad antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The main complaint is respiratory failure, with the patient remaining intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of advanced lung disease and pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/48 mmHg to 112/62 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of edema or cyanosis. The neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 173 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include continuing mechanical ventilation, monitoring for respiratory tract secretions and arterial blood gases, and treating evolving right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's hypotension has resolved, but close monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining a mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg is advised. The patient's tachycardia is controlled with diltiazem, and there are no plans for an ablation procedure"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on background of
   extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation,
   monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor ABG.  Hopefully will be
   able to demonstrate clinical response to pneumonia, and hope to work
   towards extubation.   No plans to proceed with trach if unable to
   extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem.  Continue chemical
   control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL infiltrate, treated as aspiration
   pneumonia.  Continue broad antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by a combination of evolving right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration) and narcotic use for pain management. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 97/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is being controlled with Diltiazem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake up are being implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylaxis for DVT is important, but the patient is currently on systemic anticoagulation, which needs to be evaluated and managed appropriately.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is being given to prevent this complication.
4. Seizures: The patient has experienced transient mental status changes, which may suggest partial complex seizures. Continuous EEG monitoring"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure with aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of malignancy and is experiencing atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's condition appears to be stable with controlled vital signs, although there are some concerning trends.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 157. The ABG results show hypoxemia but the SpO2 remains at 100%. The patient's recent blood gas analysis shows a pH of 36, indicating metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a slight decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) levels. The platelet count (Plt) appears to be within normal range. The creatinine (Cr) levels are slightly elevated. Other lab values such as glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, and clear breath sounds. There is also evidence of trace lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This will need to be monitored"

   >  Hypercarbic Respiratory failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:   On [**2-28**] Mr
   [**Known lastname 11322**] was noted to be in respiratory distress, somnolent,
   desaturating to the 80
s.  A VBG was performed which revealed a pH of
   7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to intubate and
   anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.   The
   differential included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary
   edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to have a
   persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated white
   count, making aspiration pneumonia the most likely explanation.    PE
   is lower on our differential given the absence of tachypnea and more
   likely explanation.  LENI

","The patient's condition is as follows:
- The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia.
- They have a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and have been experiencing altered mental status, altered nutrition, atrial flutter with RVR, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, acute renal insufficiency, and complications from chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/61 mmHg to 111/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and altered electrolyte levels.
- The patient has a history of heparin allergy and is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pain management, and diuretics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal function due to fluid overload and pre-renal causes.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on background of
   extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation,
   monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor ABG or VBG.  Hopefully
   will be able to demonstrate clinical response to pneumonia, and hope to
   work towards extubation.   No plans to proceed with trach if unable to
   extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem.  Continue chemical
   control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL infiltrate, treated as aspiration
   pneumonia.  Continue broad antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, primarily due to ventilatory failure. They have a history of advanced lung disease and are suspected to have developed right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration) as a contributing factor. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about potential complications such as hypotension, tachycardia, pulmonary infiltrates, hypokalemia, fluid imbalance, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in cardiac arrest or brain damage.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of right lower lobe infiltrates suggests the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated, it can worsen respiratory function and lead to sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate indicates tachycardia, which can be a response to hypotension or sepsis. If uncontrolled, it can increase the risk of arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia.
5. Hypokalemia: The low potassium levels need to be corrected to avoid cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is a concern, with both"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure, suspect
   multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia (aspiration),
   perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on background of
   extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation,
   monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor ABG or VBG.  Hopefully
   will be able to demonstrate clinical response to pneumonia, and hope to
   work towards extubation.   No plans to proceed with trach if unable to
   extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem.  Continue chemical
   control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL infiltrate, treated as aspiration
   pneumonia.  Continue broad antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, primarily due to ventilatory failure. The cause is attributed to evolving right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration), possibly related to narcotic use for pain management, on a background of extensive advanced lung disease. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor respiratory tract secretions and ABG or VBG. The hope is to demonstrate a clinical response to pneumonia and work towards extubation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which is causing ventilatory failure. This is due to evolving right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration) and possibly related to narcotic use for pain management. The advanced lung disease is also contributing to the respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension, but it has resolved. The plan is to monitor blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. It is being controlled with Diltiazem, and chemical control will continue.
4. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has right lower lobe infiltrates, which are being treated as aspiration pneumonia. Broad antimicrobials will be continued to cover for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).
5. Hypokalemia: The patient has hypokalem"

   >  Hypercarbic Respiratory failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:   On [**2-28**] Mr
   [**Known lastname 11322**] was noted to be in respiratory distress, somnolent,
   desaturating to the 80
s.  A VBG was performed which revealed a pH of
   7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to intubate and
   anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.   The
   differential included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary
   edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to have a
   persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated white
   count, making aspiration pneumonia the most likely explanation.    PE
   is lower on our differential given the absence of tachypnea and more
   likely explanation.  LENI

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cancer, chronic GVHD, and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress caused by hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's family is leaning towards terminal extubation without tracheostomy or PEG, opting for home hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's aspiration pneumonia is already present and can worsen if proper precautions are not taken to prevent further aspiration.
3. Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function may be compromised due to pre-renal causes or volume overload.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has a history of metabolic alkalosis, which can be exacerbated by CO2 retention.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. The source of blood loss is not clear, and the patient is refusing blood transfusion.
6. Atrial flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which is currently well-controlled with medication. However, rate control may become challenging if the patient is extubated and unable to take oral medications.
7. Heparin allergy: The patient has a known allergy to heparin, which may limit the use"

   Assessment and Plan
   >  Hypercarbic Respiratory failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:   On [**2-28**] Mr
   [**Known lastname 11322**] was noted to be in respiratory distress, somnolent,
   desaturating to the 80
s.  A VBG was performed which revealed a pH of
   7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to intubate and
   anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.   The
   differential included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary
   edema given persistent tachycardia, and PE.   Pt noted to have a
   persistnet/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated white
   count, making aspiration pneumonia the most likely explanation.    PE
   is lower on our differential given the absence of tachypnea and more
   likely explanation.  LENI

   CXR was not c/w flash.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), chronic GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and currently experiencing respiratory distress, somnolence, desaturation, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and subsequent development of hypercarbic respiratory failure with a pH of 7.14 and PCO2 >110. The differential diagnosis included worsening aspiration pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism (PE). However, PE is less likely given the absence of tachypnea and the presence of a persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, which suggests aspiration pneumonia as the most probable cause.

The patient has been receiving treatment with Vanc (vancomycin), Cefepime, and Flagyl for hospital-acquired, aspiration, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) based on antibiotic approval recommendations. The decision to discontinue the lasix drip was made as it caused alkalemia and azotemia without any improvement in urine output.

Regarding goals of care, the family is leaning towards terminal extubation, without tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and prefers to take the patient home with hospice. Pain management will be provided through midline access, but no active rate control will be pursued. Continuous discussion with the"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- No significant predominately ventilatory
   failure, suspect multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia
   (aspiration), perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on
   background of extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor
   ABG or VBG.  Hopefully will be able to demonstrate clinical response to
   pneumonia, and hope to work towards extubation.   No plans to proceed
   with trach if unable to extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem.  Continue chemical
   control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL infiltrate, treated as aspiration
   pneumonia.  Continue broad antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, likely due to evolving right lower lobe pneumonia, possibly exacerbated by narcotic use for pain management and underlying advanced lung disease. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. Other medical issues include hypotension, tachycardia, pulmonary infiltrates, hypokalemia, fluid balance, nutritional support, GVHD, CML, and seizures. The patient is a post-transplant patient with chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying pneumonia does not improve or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for further infections, including hospital-acquired infections, due to being immunocompromised and critically ill.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent hypovolemia or fluid overload.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypokalemia, which needs to be corrected to avoid cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. GVHD: The patient has chronic GVHD, which can lead to complications such as liver dysfunction, skin rash, and gastrointestinal symptoms.
6. CML: The patient's chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) may progress or cause complications such as bone marrow suppression or bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- No significant predominately ventilatory
   failure, suspect multifactorial, attributed to evolving RLL pneumonia
   (aspiration), perhaps component of narcotic use (pain management), on
   background of extensive advanced lung disease.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor respiratory tract secretions, monitor
   ABG or VBG.  Hopefully will be able to demonstrate clinical response to
   pneumonia, and hope to work towards extubation.   No plans to proceed
   with trach if unable to extubate.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor BP and MAP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- A-flutter, controlled on Diltiazem.  Continue chemical
   control.  No plans for ablation procedure.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL infiltrate, treated as aspiration
   pneumonia.  Continue broad antimicrobials to cover for HCAP.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   FLUIDS -- Hypovolemia.  Plan net expand intravascular volume.  Monitor
   I/O.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating TF at goal.  No plan for PEG.
   GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   CML -- s/p transplant, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans.
   SEIZURES -- no clinical evidence for motor seizure.  With transient and
   reversible mental status changes, need to consider partial complex
   seizures (temporal lobe locus of CNS abnormalities).  Would check
   continuous EEG, consider repeat Neurological consulation to
   specifically address question of paritial complex seizures.  Continue
   Keppra.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.
- The patient has been sedated but appears comfortable.
- The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is attributed to evolving right lower lobe pneumonia (aspiration) and extensive advanced lung disease.
- The patient also has hypotension, tachycardia, pulmonary infiltrates, hypokalemia, and fluid imbalance.
- The patient is tolerating tube feeds well and has a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans following a stem cell transplant.
- The patient experienced transient mental status changes but no motor seizures.
- The patient's current medications include PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis, Keppra for seizures, and systemic anticoagulation.
- The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure may worsen due to evolving pneumonia and advanced lung disease.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's rapid heart rate needs to be controlled to prevent further complications such as arrhythmias.
4. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The presence of right lower lobe infiltrates suggests pneumonia, which should be treated promptly to prevent worsening respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of malignant neoplasm, chronic GVHD, and bronchiolitis obliterans. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress, somnolence, and desaturation to the 80s. A VBG revealed a pH of 7.14 and PCO2 >110, leading to the decision to intubate. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia, with worsening right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR. The patient's white blood cell count has also increased. He has been aggressively diuresed for bilateral pleural effusions and continues to have thick yellow secretions. The patient's family is leaning towards terminal extubation without tracheostomy or PEG, and plans for hospice care have been discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing VAP. The current treatment includes antibiotics (cefepime, flagyl, vanc), and the patient is nearing completion of VAP treatment.
2. Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function is likely pre-renal with an ATN component, as indicated by worsening renal parameters since discontinuing lasix. Over-diures"

The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of malignancy and complications from chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress, somnolence, and desaturation. Intubation was performed, and he was diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been receiving aggressive diuresis for bilateral pleural effusions and continues to have thick yellow secretions.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient presented with respiratory distress, somnolence, and desaturation. A VBG revealed a pH of 7.14 and PCO2 >110, indicating hypercarbic respiratory failure. Intubation was performed, and the likely worsening aspiration pneumonia with persistent/increasing right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and newly elevated white count was noted. The patient is nearing completion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treatment and has been aggressively diuresed for bilateral pleural effusions. Secretions are still present, which may indicate ongoing aspiration.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC:  Secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia superimposed on bronchiolitis obliterans secondary to chronic
   GVH.  Continues to have moderate to large amount of secretions.
   Continue antibiotics.
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with RVR:  On oral diltiazem. Transient
   tachyarrhythmia overnight, may have been over diuresed.
 ANEMIA, OTHER:  Patient refused transfusion for hct 20 yesterday, up

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is acute on chronic respiratory failure. They are intubated and continue to have poor urine output, with improvement after receiving IV fluid bolus. The patient experienced tachycardia and associated desaturation to the high 80s, for which diltiazem was given for rate control. Lasix was also administered, but the patient did not respond to it. The patient has a history of allergies to Amphotericin B, Ambisome, Campath, and unknown heparin agents.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Azithromycin at 09:16 AM, Cefepime at 11:54 AM, Vancomycin and Metronidazole both at 08:00 PM, and Acyclovir also at 08:00 PM.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour and fentanyl (Concentrate) at 75 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include diltiazem given at 06:50 AM and furosemide (Lasix) given at 07:15 AM.

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above.

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate is 126 bpm with a"

   [**Known lastname 11322**] was noted to be in respiratory distress, somnolent,
   desaturating to the 80
s.  A VBG was performed which revealed a pH of
   7.14 and a PCO2 - >110.  The decision was made to intubate and
   anesthesia came and performed a right nare intubation.   Most likely
   [**3-11**] worsening aspiration pneumonia w/ persistent/increasing RLL
   infiltrate on CXR, and newly elevated white count. Now nearing
   completion of VAP tx, has been aggressively diuresed for bilateral
   pleural effusions. Continues to have thick yellow secretions (possibly
   sinus). This AM, likely had aspiration of these secretions vs. mucous
   plug, resolved. Barriers to exubate are underlying end-stage lung
   disease and secretions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cancer, chronic GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and other medical conditions. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 100/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 100%. The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels and urea nitrogen levels. He also has anemia, metabolic alkalosis, and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 2,181 mL, and he has received a total of 2,676 mL of fluids since the last 24 hours. The patient's urine output has been poor and has responded to a fluid bolus. The patient's family is leaning towards terminal extubation without tracheostomy or PEG. They would like to take him home with hospice care. The patient's goals of care include discussing the plan with the patient, switching to propofol for rapid lifting of sedation, and considering palliative care. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, persistent or increasing right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, newly elevated white count,"

The patient's medical conditions include:
- Respiratory failure (chronic)
- Renal failure
- Atrial flutter with RVR
- Anemia, other
- Alkalosis, metabolic
- Alteration in nutrition
- Cancer (malignant neoplasm), other

The patient's goals of care include terminal extubation, no tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The family would like to take the patient home with hospice. The patient needs to be discussed with the multi-disciplinary team, particularly regarding the switch to propofol and palliative care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing secretions and underlying end-stage lung disease, further deterioration of renal function, and possible bleeding complications due to the use of heparin agents in the past. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, and bleeding parameters."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of cancer, complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's recent history includes worsening respiratory distress, somnolence, and desaturation. A VBG revealed a pH of 7.14 and a PCO2 >110, leading to the decision of intubation. The patient likely has a worsening aspiration pneumonia with persistent/increasing RLL infiltrate on CXR and newly elevated white count. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypercarbic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia: The patient continues to have thick yellow secretions, possibly sinus. He is nearing completion of VAP treatment and has been aggressively diuresed for bilateral pleural effusions. Barriers to extubation are underlying end-stage lung disease and secretions. 
- Atrial flutter (AFLUTTER) with RVR: The patient's heart rate is controlled with PO diltiazem, but increased to 170s this AM while being cleaned, responded to IV diltiazem. He is not a candidate for anticoagulation given his poor long-term prognosis.
- Acute renal insufficiency: The patient likely has pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) with an ATN component now given continued worsening since"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute on chronic respiratory failure. He has been experiencing worsening respiratory distress, desaturation, and altered mental status. The patient was intubated and diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. He has completed a 7-day course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been aggressively diuresed for bilateral pleural effusions. The patient continues to have thick yellow secretions, likely due to sinus or aspiration of these secretions. Barriers to extubation include underlying end-stage lung disease (bronchiolitis obliterans), secretions, and weakness.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with pre-renal etiology and a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His creatinine level is increasing, and he has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and a small bolus. Aggressive diuresis has been initiated to manage pleural effusions and secretions. The goal is to achieve even urine output.

Additionally, the patient has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which has been partially controlled with an increased dose of diltiazem. The patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to poor long-term prognosis.

Other findings include anemia, metabolic alkalosis, and a history of cancer (malignant neopl"

The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic respiratory failure. He has a history of malignancy, chronic GVHD, and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient's recent events include worsening respiratory distress, somnolence, desaturation, intubation, and the development of bilateral pleural effusions. He has completed a course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and is nearing completion of VAP treatment. The patient's current conditions include renal failure, chronic respiratory failure, atrial flutter with RVR, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, and a history of cancer. The patient's family is leaning towards terminal extubation, without tracheostomy or PEG. Goals of care include discussing with the patient, switching to propofol for rapid lifting of sedation, and considering palliative care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving ICU care and has experienced several events over the past few days. The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, indicating possible renal failure. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a drifting hematocrit level. The patient also received normal saline (NS) for marginal urine output. The patient's antibiotic regimen for aspiration pneumonia has been completed, and prophylactic medications such as bactrim and acyclovir have been discontinued due to renal failure. The patient is currently on propofol for sedation, and haloperidol is being used for agitation. The patient has a history of allergies to amphotericin B, Ambisome, and Campath. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 147 bpm, blood pressure of 88/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37, pCO2 of 32, and pO2 of 140. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver enzymes, as well as increased creatinine and blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes"

 Seen by renal, no hydronephrosis on ultrasound, but muddy
   brown casts evident on urine analysis.  Likely ATN secondary to
   possible vancomycin toxicity (elevated troughs 80s-90s) vs episodes of

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and anemia.

The patient's recent medical history includes recurrent pneumonia, worsening aspiration pneumonia with persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, and bilateral pleural effusions. He has completed a seven-day course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been aggressively diuresed for the pleural effusions. The patient continues to have thick yellow secretions in his airways, which may lead to further episodes of aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure ranging from 87/48 mmHg to 111/70 mmHg, heart rate between 81 and 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 to 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on positive pressure ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient is also on propofol and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.

   Now patient has completed 7 day course for VAP tx (Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl
   [**Date range (1) 11504**]) and has been aggressively diuresed for bilateral pleural
   effusions. Continues to have thick yellow secretions (possibly sinus).
   Likely had aspiration of these secretions vs. mucous plug, resolved.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 45M CML s/p BMT c/b BO / GVHD p/w resp
   failure. Creatinine rising (bactrim /. acyclovir held), transfused
   overnight.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4 BP 111/70 HR 110 RR 18 with sat 100 on PSV
   15/8 0.5. Frail man, c/o pain in front of chest and in back. Follows
   some one-step commands. Coarse BS. Hyperdynamic s1s2. Soft +BS. Diffuse
   skin changes c/w GVHD. Labs notable for WBC 8K, HCT 25, K+ 4.5, Cr 3.5.
   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure with vent
   support - wean PSV as able and try SBT. For recurrent pneumonia, now
   off abx, recheck sputum today. Other components
 neuromuscular
   weakness / restriction, volume overload, BO, chronic aspiration more
   difficult to treat other than with ongoing support. ARF is progressive,
   poor UOP, hold bactrim / lasix / acyclovir and d/w renal and onc teams.
   Dilt for atrial flutter
 continue at current dose. Global issue of
   advanced lung disease and progressive ARF - will d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] and
   family today. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now experiencing complications such as bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), atrial flutter, and other medical conditions.

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of non-invasive ventilation support (CPAP/PSV), but he still requires ongoing ventilatory support due to underlying end-stage lung disease (bronchiolitis obliterans) and secretions.
2. The patient has developed ARF, likely secondary to possible vancomycin toxicity and hypotension with pre-renal components from diuresis. The renal team has been consulted, and the patient's urine output is being trended. Medications causing nephrotoxicity, such as bactrim and acyclovir, have been held.
3. The patient has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and rate control is being managed with diltiazem.
4. The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level, and he received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC).

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 45M CML s/p BMT c/b BO / GVHD p/w resp
   failure. Creatinine rising (bactrim /. acyclovir held), transfused
   overnight.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4 BP 111/70 HR 110 RR 18 with sat 100 on PSV
   15/8 0.5. Frail man, c/o pain in front of chest and in back. Follows
   some one-step commands. Coarse BS. Hyperdynamic s1s2. Soft +BS. Diffuse
   skin changes c/w GVHD. Labs notable for WBC 8K, HCT 25, K+ 4.5, Cr 3.5.
   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure with vent
   support - wean PSV as able and try SBT. For recurrent pneumonia, now
   off abx, recheck sputum today. Other components
 neuromuscular
   weakness / restriction, volume overload, BO, chronic aspiration more
   difficult to treat other than with ongoing support. ARF is progressive,
   poor UOP, hold bactrim / lasix / acyclovir and d/w renal and onc teams.

 continue at current dose. Global issue of
   advanced lung disease and progressive ARF - will d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] and

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is now presenting with multiple medical complications. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, and altered nutrition.

Key Points:

1. The patient was intubated on 02/28 due to respiratory distress, somnolent state, and hypoxia. A VBG revealed a pH of 7.14 and PCO2 >110, indicating hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia.
2. The patient has completed a 7-day course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been aggressively diuresed for bilateral pleural effusions.
3. The patient's current condition includes thick yellow secretions (possibly sinus), likely aspirated, leading to worsening aspiration pneumonia with persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and elevated white blood cell count.
4. The patient has been over-diuresed, resulting in pre-renal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, likely due to chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans.
6. The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely exacerb"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old with a history of malignancy, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 87/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl and propofol for sedation, as well as antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately. This can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
4. Thromboembolic events: Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Malignancy: The patient's underlying malign"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of malignancy, chronic GVHD, and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and was re-intubated for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's baseline lung disease is poor due to bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient has completed a course of VAP treatment and is planned for tracheostomy today. 

The patient has oliguric renal failure with muddy brown casts evident on urine analysis. The likely cause of renal failure is possible vancomycin toxicity and episodes of hypotension. CVVH is needed for vancomycin toxicity, and the patient needs a temporary line. Diuretics should be continued, and bactrim and acyclovir should be held.

The patient also has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. Diltiazem should be continued for rate control, and the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to poor long-term prognosis.

The patient has other anemia, which is stable, and should be trended. The patient has a history of cancer with complications of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Home dose prednisone should be continued, along with azithromycin. IV bactrim and acyclovir should be held due to acute renal failure.

The patient is on full code status and is currently in the ICU."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU

   add the following points: 45M CML s/p BMT c/b BO / GVHD p/w resp

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to various complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter, anemia, and altered mental status. The patient has a poor prognosis with multiple organ dysfunction and end-stage lung disease. He expresses a wish to pursue a tracheostomy and possibly a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for nutrition. The medical team is considering palliative care options and managing his pain and anxiety with medication. The patient's condition is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Continued ventilator support may be necessary, but the patient's end-stage lung disease makes the prognosis very poor.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to multiple medications and a history of bactrim and acyclovir use. This condition requires careful management and may progress to end-stage renal disease if not treated appropriately.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR). It is important to manage this arrhythmia with antiarrhythmic medication to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU

   add the following points: 45M CML s/p BMT c/b BO / GVHD p/w resp

   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure with

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now experiencing bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with recurrent pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure.
- The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and is not a candidate for extubation due to underlying end-stage lung disease, secretions, and weakness.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely secondary to vancomycin toxicity or hypotension with pre-renal causes. Renal function is worsening with rising creatinine levels.
- The patient has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and is being managed with diltiazem for rate control.
- The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level, for which 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) were transfused.
- The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans.
- The patient has allergies to heparin and amphotericin B.
- The patient is on multiple medications, including pantoprazole, haloperidol, morphine sulfate, fentanyl, propofol, and others.
- The patient's family met yesterday and discussed the plan to pursue a tracheostomy. The patient's wishes to pursue a tracheostomy were also expressed.
- The patient's pain and anxiety are ongoing concerns, and methadone has been started for pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying end-stage lung disease, coupled with bronchiolitis obliterans and secretions, poses a significant risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with rising creatinine levels. This may indicate worsening ARF, possibly secondary to vancomycin toxicity or hypotension with pre-renal causes.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response needs to be managed properly to maintain heart rate control and prevent further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require ongoing transfusion support.
5. Cancer and Chronic GVHD: The patient's history of malignancy and chronic GVHD increases the risk of further complications related to immunosuppression and potential infections.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional details and assessments may be required for a comprehensive analysis."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 45M CML s/p BMT c/b BO / GVHD p/w resp
   failure. Trach yesterday, unable to place G-tube, did get HD line / HD
   yesterday with drop in vanco level.

   Hyperdynamic s1s2. Soft +BS. Diffuse skin changes c/w GVHD. Labs
   notable for WBC 10K, HCT 24, K 3.9, Cr 2.6.
   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure with vent
   support and PSV wean / TM trials today. ARF is progressive, tolerating
   HD, will check f/u vanco level. Dilt for atrial flutter
 continue at
   current dose; need to add metoprolol for better control. Keppra for TL
   mass / possible seizures. Start TFs today. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post allogenic transplant, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and bronchiolitis obliterans.
- The patient was previously transferred to the ICU for worsening dyspnea and altered mental status, requiring intubation.
- Upon admission, the patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy but was unable to get a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- The patient has a baseline lung disease of bronchiolitis obliterans and was reintubated on [**2-28**] for respiratory distress secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has completed a course of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treatment and has shown significant improvement.
- The patient is currently experiencing oliguric renal failure (RF), which is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to possible vancomycin toxicity and episodes of hypotension. The patient requires continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for vancomycin toxicity.
- The patient also has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is uncontrolled despite diltiazem therapy. The patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to poor long-term prognosis.
- The patient has anemia, other, with stable hematocrit (Hct).
- The patient has a history of"

   2. Gallbladder wall thickening and sludge within the gallbladder.
   Gallbladder wall thickening is likely due to third spacing in the
   setting of
   hepatitis.
   3. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. CBD measures 5 mm.
   4. Abdominal ascites.
   Echo [**2155-3-12**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to
   extensive septal, anterior, and apical akinesis with anterior septal
   dyskinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global
   free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
   artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is
   a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
   presence of elevated right sided pressures.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-1-28**], no major change.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal distension. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy at 02:00 PM on [**2155-3-12**]. The patient's nurse reported that the patient did not have a fever or any focal signs of infection, but there was an increase in abdominal distension. Blood culture from [**2155-3-9**] grew GPCs in clusters, and urine culture on [**2155-3-7**] grew Proteus, which is resistant to tetracycline. The patient's BNP checked at [**Numeric Identifier 11526**] showed no baseline. Bladder pressure was measured at 14. An ultrasound showed sludge and gallbladder thickening, with no elevated common bile duct. An echo indicated worsening 4+ TR/RV dysfunction and liver findings suggestive of third spacing in the setting of hepatitis.

The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and allergies to Amphotericin B, Ambisome (Intraven.), Campath (Intraven.), and Heparin Agents. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure of 91/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving propof"

   Disposition: Pending resolution of a flutter with RVR
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is abdominal distension. The patient has a history of chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. They were transferred to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions including:

1. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has oliguric renal failure, which is characterized by decreased urine output. The presence of muddy brown casts on urine analysis suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This could be secondary to possible vancomycin toxicity and episodes of hypotension with a component of pre-renal from diuresis. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is recommended for vancomycin toxicity.

2. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which may be due to underlying lung disease such as bronchiolitis obliterans. They were reintubated on [**2-28**] for respiratory distress secondary to aspiration pneumonia and have completed a course of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treatment.

3. Atrial Flutter with RVR: The patient has uncontrolled atrial flutter with RVR. Temporary response to diltiazem IV pushes was observed, but the patient is again in RVR. Diltiazem will be continued for rate control, and anticoagulation is not recommended due to poor long-term prognosis.

4. Anemia, Other: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable, and no specific interventions are mentioned for anemia management.

5. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Other: The patient has a history of cancer and is complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. They are currently on home dose prednisone, azithromycin, and their bactrim and acyclovir IV will be held due to acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, exacerbation of respiratory failure, development of further arrhythmias, and potential infections due to immunocompromised state."

   1. Normal flow and waveforms within the hepatic vasculature.
   2. Gallbladder wall thickening and sludge within the gallbladder.
   Gallbladder wall thickening is likely due to third spacing in the
   setting of
   hepatitis.
   3. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. CBD measures 5 mm.
   4. Abdominal ascites.
   Echo [**2155-3-12**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to
   extensive septal, anterior, and apical akinesis with anterior septal
   dyskinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global
   free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
   artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is
   a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
   presence of elevated right sided pressures.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-1-28**], no major change.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to bronchiolitis obliterans, a lung disease commonly seen in patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing oliguric renal failure, which is characterized by reduced urine output. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possibly secondary to vancomycin toxicity and hypotension. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is planned for vancomycin toxicity management.

3. Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient has uncontrolled atrial flutter with RVR, which can result in an irregular heartbeat and decreased cardiac output. Diltiazem is being used for rate control.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic GVHD and ongoing blood loss.

5. Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.

6. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient is experiencing AMS, which can be a result of multiple factors such as electrolyte imbalances, organ dysfunction, or medications.

7. Heparin allergy and pneumonitis: The patient has a known allergy to heparin,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, and alteration in nutrition. The patient also has a history of malignancy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 104 bpm (range: 82-149 bpm), blood pressure of 108/65 mmHg (range: 74-113/45-80 mmHg), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (range: 0-33 breaths/min), and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including diltiazem for the management of atrial flutter, fentanyl patch for pain relief, pantoprazole, haloperidol, lorazepam, and fentanyl infusion.

The physical examination reveals thinness, bitemporal wasting, and muscle wasting. The patient's skin breakdown is causing persistent pain, for which they have been started on a fentanyl patch. The patient's peripheral pulses and neurologic examination were not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, and leukocyte count, along with decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and sodium."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post-allogenic transplant, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/65 to 113/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure has led to the need for mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. There is ongoing effort to decrease pressure support.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. He is receiving dialysis to manage this condition and monitor vancomycin levels.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. Medications such as diltiazem have been initiated to control the heart rate.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. A blood transfusion will be given during hemodialysis.
5. Trismus: The patient's limited mouth opening due to trismus is hindering the endoscopic approach for nutritional support. A per"

- He has completed a course of treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient is currently experiencing oliguric renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from possible vancomycin toxicity and hypotension.
- He requires continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for vancomycin toxicity.
- The patient's atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) was initially controlled with diltiazem IV pushes but returned in RVR.
- He is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to poor long-term prognosis.
- The patient has a history of other malignancies and is complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans.
- His anemia is stable.
- The patient has a heparin allergy and pneumonitis.
- The patient's disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's baseline lung disease and recent aspiration pneumonia pose a risk for recurrent respiratory failure.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT). He has developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans, leading to end-stage lung disease and respiratory failure. 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. His vital signs include a temperature of 98.6°F, blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on pressure support ventilation (PSV). 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, which was unsuccessful. Instead, an infrared-guided feeding tube (IR-guided G-tube) has been recommended by surgery. 

The patient also has a known allergy to heparin and is experiencing oliguric renal failure, secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is receiving hemodialysis (HD) and his urine output remains low. His serum creatinine levels are elevated, and vancomycin trough levels are being monitored due to concerns about supratherapeutic levels. 

Additionally, the patient has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and anemia, which has been managed with blood transfusion. He"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), who underwent an allogenic transplant and developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
- He has bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease, and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.
- The patient has a known allergy to heparin, amphotericin B, and alemtuzumab.
- He received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with hemodialysis (HD) yesterday.
- An intraoperative (IR) guided gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placement is recommended due to the failure to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube during tracheostomy.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/62 mmHg to 114/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 50%.
- The patient has received various medications including pantoprazole, fentanyl, and antibiotics.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,164 mL and output of 1,040 mL, with a negative balance of 124 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old gentleman with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter with RVR, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, and alteration in nutrition. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a tracheostomy tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with FiO2 of 50%. The patient's physical examination reveals cachexia, no murmurs, rhonchi in the bilateral lung bases, thin abdomen with no masses, normal neurologic examination, and an NG tube in place.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low sodium, elevated potassium, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results indicate prolonged PT/PTT, elevated D-dimer, lactic acid, LDH, and altered electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and use of CPAP/PSV mode ventilation indicate an increased risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Renal Comp"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogenic transplant. He has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has tracheostomy placement and is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate (HR) of 95 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%.

The patient received a unit of packed red blood cells (uPRBC) with hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and is scheduled for an enteral feeding tube (G-tube) placement. Allergies include amphotericin B, Ambisome, and heparin agents. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was cefazolin on 03/12/15 at 12:45 PM and azithromycin on 03/13/15 at 04:05 PM. He is currently receiving pantoprazole, fentanyl, and other ICU medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogenic transplant. He has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and end-stage lung disease. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is experiencing respiratory failure. He also has acute oliguric renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), atrial flutter with regular ventricular response (RVR), anemia, alteration in nutrition, and a history of malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, has led to end-stage lung disease, resulting in chronic respiratory failure. The placement of a tracheostomy tube has helped improve his condition temporarily. However, there is a risk of further deterioration and the need for long-term ventilatory support.
2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute oliguric renal failure, which is secondary to ATN. This condition is characterized by low urine output and impaired kidney function. It is essential to monitor daily vancomycin levels and continue hemodialysis (HD) as needed to manage the renal failure.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter with RVR. It is crucial to continue medication management, including diltiazem and clon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogenic transplant. He is currently experiencing chronic respiratory failure due to bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease. The patient has undergone tracheostomy placement and is receiving mechanical ventilation support. His renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute oliguric renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is also experiencing atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is currently in normal sinus rhythm. The patient's hemoglobin levels are stable after a transfusion, but he has an ongoing alteration in nutrition due to the inability to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. He has a history of other malignancies complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is being treated with immunosuppressive therapy and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's underlying lung disease and dependence on mechanical ventilation make him prone to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute oliguric renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed. This could result in electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The presence of atr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent an allogenic transplant and is currently experiencing chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). He has bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease, and has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient is now on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy tube and is being weaned off pressure support. He also has acute oliguric renal failure, atrial flutter, anemia, and an alteration in nutrition. The patient's medical history includes malignancy and chronic GVHD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially requiring increased levels of ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately. This could necessitate ongoing hemodialysis and careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter could potentially progress to atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias, leading to hemodynamic instability and requiring intervention such as cardioversion or antiarrhythmic medications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if there is ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. Close monitoring of hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, and a history of cancer. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/58 to 129/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and receiving tube feeds. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and the use of certain medications can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Heparin allergy: The patient has a known allergy to heparin agents, which should be taken into consideration when managing any potential thrombotic events.
5. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing chronic renal failure may worsen due to acute kidney injury"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post allogenic transplant, chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has undergone tracheostomy placement. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), atrial flutter, anemia, and malnutrition. He also has a history of cancer and is on several medications including prednisone, azithromycin, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, has led to chronic respiratory failure. This condition can worsen and potentially result in further respiratory compromise.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing oliguric renal failure due to ATN. This can lead to worsening kidney function and may require dialysis.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. If not properly managed, it can progress to a more serious arrhythmia and compromise cardiac output.
4. Anemia: The patient is currently stable after a recent transfusion but may require ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin levels and potential further transfusions.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as tube feeds have been held due to the inability to place a"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status (not delirium), and alteration in nutrition. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm). The patient is currently experiencing a heparin allergy and pneumonitis. 

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and there is no disposition mentioned. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of acute renal failure, worsening of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, further development of anemia, exacerbation of metabolic alkalosis, deterioration of altered mental status, and potential complications related to the patient's underlying malignancy. Additionally, the patient's heparin allergy and pneumonitis may also contribute to potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogenic transplant and developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He also has bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease, and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been placed on a tracheostomy (trach) and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His renal function has deteriorated, resulting in acute oliguric renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is anemic but has been stabilized after a transfusion. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement was planned but has been postponed due to the patient's unstable condition. The patient also has atrial flutter with variable rate and is being treated with diltiazem and clonazepam. Additionally, the patient has a history of malignancy complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and bronchiolitis obliterans put him at risk for further respiratory complications. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to ensure adequate gas exchange.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated serum creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. The cause of AKI in this case is likely ATN, possibly due to hypotension and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual who weighs 61.6 kg. They are currently admitted to the ICU and have been diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter with RVR, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, and alteration in nutrition. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm). They are experiencing an altered mental status, which is not due to delirium. The patient's blood culture was sent at 10:30 pm on [**2155-3-17**], and their urine culture was sent at 9:00 pm on the same day. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was cefazolin at 9:00 pm on [**2155-3-17**]. The patient has allergies to Amphotericin B, Ambisome, and Campath. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if their condition does not improve or if there are complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could progress to end-stage renal disease if not properly managed. This could lead to further complications like fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter with RVR increases the risk of embolic events, including stroke. Proper management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease. The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and is being weaned off pressure support. He also has acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is on hemodialysis (HD). The patient is allergic to heparin and is being treated for atrial flutter. He has anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, and a recent alteration in nutrition due to an inability to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient's cancer history is complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, has led to chronic respiratory failure. The management plan includes continuing trials of decreased pressure support and tracheostomy trials.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is secondary to ATN and hypotension. The management plan includes continuing HD, monitoring daily vancomycin levels, and following guidelines.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter with"

   -Bleeding around trach.  IP came to evaluate: saw a clot in the
   suprastomal area which was suctioned with no residual active bleeding
   between 2nd/3rd ring during bronch.  Applied lidocain/epi.
   -There was a concern for tracheal innominate fistula.  Had a long
   discussion between IP, heme/onc, radiology, surgery regarding MRA vs
   CTA (given his renal failure).  Ultimately, he needed stat CTA neck.
   Discussed this with patient and his wife to great depths.  He was
   premedicated with sodium bicarb, famotidine, benadryl, and zofran.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogenic transplant and is experiencing chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient has bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease, and has been placed on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, and alteration in nutrition. The patient also has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and is currently on multiple medications, including pain control, antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticonvulsants.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Tracheostomy bleed: The patient has a new bleeding at the tracheostomy site, which requires evaluation by an intensivist to determine if wound exploration is necessary.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient is oliguric, indicating low urine output. This could be secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and supratherapeutic vancomycin levels. Monitoring daily vancomycin levels and adjusting the dosage accordingly is important.
3. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient has bronchiolitis obliterans, which is an obstruct"

   -There was a concern for tracheal innominate fistula.  Had a long
   discussion between IP, heme/onc, radiology, surgery regarding MRA vs
   CTA (given his renal failure).  Ultimately, he needed stat CTA neck.
   Discussed this with patient and his wife to great depths.  He was

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and a previous allogenic transplant, who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. He has undergone several medical interventions, including tracheostomy placement, bronchoscopy, and gastrostomy tube placement. The patient is also diagnosed with renal failure, atrial flutter, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, and altered nutrition. He has a history of cancer and is being treated for chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, has led to chronic respiratory failure. This condition requires careful management to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Heparin Allergy: The patient has a known allergy to heparin, which may complicate the management of any condition requiring anticoagulation.
3. Pneumonitis: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonitis, which is an inflammation of the lung tissue. This condition can further compromise respiratory function and may require additional treatment.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypotension and supratherapeutic vancomycin (Vanc) levels. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte balance are essential.
5. Atrial Flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which requires management with antiarrhythmic medications such as diltiazem and metoprolol to maintain normal sinus rhythm.
6. Anemia: The patient has a stable anemia, which has been managed with transfusion. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary to determine further treatment options.
7. Altered Nutrition: Due to the patient's altered nutritional status, a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube has been placed for enteral feeding. Close monitoring of tube placement, residual volumes, and overall nutritional intake is crucial.
8. Cancer History: The patient's history of cancer and chronic GVHD may require ongoing management with immunosuppressive medications and regular follow-up with the oncology team.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2155-3-18**] 06:25 PM
   [**2155-3-18**]:
   -PEG placed.
   -Bleeding around trach.  IP came to evaluate: saw a clot in the
   suprastomal area which was suctioned with no residual active bleeding
   between 2nd/3rd ring during bronch.  Applied lidocain/epi.
   -There was a concern for tracheal innominate fistula.  Had a long
   discussion between IP, heme/onc, radiology, surgery regarding MRA vs
   CTA (given his renal failure).  Ultimately, he needed stat CTA neck.
   Discussed this with patient and his wife to great depths.  He was
   premedicated with sodium bicarb, famotidine, benadryl, and zofran.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has atrial flutter with RVR (rate-related ventricular response), acute renal failure, chronic respiratory failure, and chronic pain. Additionally, the patient has a history of cancer, and there are concerns about tracheal innominate fistula, which requires further evaluation with a CTA (computed tomography angiography).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/73 mmHg to 118/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated through a tracheostomy tube and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild epigastric tenderness, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances.

Imaging shows the tracheostomy tip above the carina, NG tube tip below the diaphragm, and central venous line tip at the cavoatrial junction. There are bilateral pleural effusions and moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, which may obscure infection and warrant further evaluation with a chest CT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has undergone an allogenic transplant and is currently experiencing bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease. The patient requires chronic respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and is not currently requiring mechanical ventilation. There are no signs of tracheal innominate fistula/avm/high-grade stenosis on the CTA neck, and the tracheal bleed is likely superficial. The patient's allergies include amphotericin B, Ambisome, and heparin agents. The patient's recent medical interventions include cefazolin, fentanyl, and a PEG tube placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease. This condition requires ongoing respiratory support, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely caused by hypotension and supratherapeutic vancomycin levels. This condition requires close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management of fluid balance and electrolytes.
3. Anemia: The patient is anemic but stable after transfusion. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will be necessary to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of cancer, chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter with RVR, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, and allergies to heparin and Ambosome. The patient is currently in the ICU for pain control, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter, and other conditions. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 50%. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments including fentanyl, heparin, and dialysis catheter placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonitis: The patient has a history of heparin allergy, which can increase the risk of developing pneumonitis if exposed to heparin or heparin-containing products.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization, there is an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis measures should be implemented"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 45M CML s/p BMT c/b BO / GVHD p/w resp
   failure. IR PEG placed, CT s e/o tracheo-inominate fistula.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.8 BP 110/59 HR 90/AFL RR 18 with sat 100 on VAC
   450x16 5 0.5. Frail man, lucid, follows commands. No new bleeding at
   trach site. Coarse BS. Hyperdynamic s1s2. Soft +BS. Diffuse skin
   changes c/w GVHD. Labs notable for WBC 11K, HCT 22, K 4.3, Cr 3.2.
   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure with vent
   support and PSV wean; continue azithro and pred for BO, HD for volume
   removal and IP consult for R thoracentesis to assist in weaning. Will
   consider TM trials after procedures. Trach bleed stable, will confirm
   no TIF on final CT read. ARF continues with minimal UOP, tolerating HD,
   would favor aggressive volume removal to assist in weaning. Atrial
   flutter
 dilt / metoprolol per NGT. Keppra for TL mass / possible
   seizures - give after HD. Will d/w BMT re acyclovir and bactrim
   prophylaxis, continue fluconazole. Resume TFs today, monitor FSG. PT /
   OT eval, rehab screening. Fentanyl patch / klonopin for anxiety
   working well. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a previous allogenic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to bronchiolitis obliterans, end-stage lung disease, and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy placement, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and hemodialysis (HD). He is experiencing acute renal failure, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, anxiety, anemia, and alterations in nutrition. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to bronchiolitis obliterans and end-stage lung disease. The tracheostomy placement aims to make the patient less ventilator-dependent, but there is a risk of complications such as pneumonia or pneumonitis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is oliguric with low urine output, which may be secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypotension and supratherapeutic vancomycin levels. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been placed back on the ventilator due to a high CO2 level of 76, indicating respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The rare yeast found in the respiratory culture suggests a possible fungal infection. This could potentially lead to pneumonia or other respiratory infections.

3. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine levels (1.7, 2.6, 3.4) indicate acute renal failure. The patient may require dialysis to manage kidney function.

4. Anemia: The low hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL indicates anemia, which could be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or bone marrow suppression.

5. Alkalosis: The high bicarbonate level of 34 suggests metabolic alkalosis, which can occur as a compensatory mechanism in response to respiratory acidosis or due to other underlying conditions.

6. Heparin allergy: The patient has an allergy to heparin, which is an anticoagulant medication. This allergy may increase the risk of thrombotic events or allergic reactions if heparin is administered.

7. Cancer: The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), which could contribute to their overall vulnerability and susceptibility to complications.

8. Alterations in nutrition: The patient may have alterations in nutrition,"

He has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and is currently experiencing respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to bronchiolitis obliterans and recent aspiration episode. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient is oliguric, meaning he is producing less urine than expected, indicating possible acute renal failure. He is receiving dialysis while at the rehabilitation facility.

3. Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient is experiencing atrial flutter with RVR, but currently in normal sinus rhythm. He is being treated with PO diltiazem and metoprolol.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia post-transfusion.

5. Nutrition: The patient has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition. Tube feeds are being continued via the PEG tube, and the head of bed (HOB) is elevated to 30 degrees with aspiration precautions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogenic transplant and developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has also experienced acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and oliguria. Additionally, the patient has atrial flutter with rate-responsive ventilation (RVR) and anemia. The patient is currently on dialysis, receiving tube feeds via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and has a history of malignancy complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying chronic respiratory disease and bronchiolitis obliterans may lead to further deterioration in lung function, necessitating ongoing respiratory support.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. This condition requires careful monitoring and management, including potential dialysis.
3. Atrial Flutter: The presence of atrial flutter with RVR increases the risk of arrhythmias and potential cardiac complications. Close monitoring and management of heart rate and rhythm are essential.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be managed appropriately, considering the"
