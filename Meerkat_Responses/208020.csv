   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o M with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities with history of bipolar disorder on multiple psychiatric
   medications.
   #  Altered Mental Status
 pt had been having continued confusion and
   hallucinations.  Pt
s AMS could be due to several different factors,
   including his hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium
   in the setting of the ICU.
   - Will continue to monitor patient closely with q2hr neuro checks.
   - Continue to give fluids to help treat rhabdo and hyponatremia.
   - Given pt
s development of nystagmus and patient
s injuries that are
   not completely explained, would like to possibly get head imaging.
   Would hold off on this, however, until patient is more cooperative.
   .
   #  Acute Renal Failure
 likely associated with rhabdomyolysis
   - will continue NS at 200mL/hr
   - will continue to replete calcium and potassium PRN
   - will continue to follow any renal recommendations
   - also, will continue q4hr distal pulse checks
   # Rhabdomyolysis
 unclear etiology.  Pt reports having fallen, but his
   history does not match the extent of his bruising and rhabdo.
   - treat as above
   - awaiting social work consult
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 this is slowly correcting with fluids.  Pt did have a
   slight decrease when he was give potassium in sterile water.  However,
   expect that sodium will continue to rise when the patient starts
   receiving normal saline again.
   - continue 200mL/hr of NS
   - continue to monitor electrolytes regularly
 q4hrs
   .
   # Anemia
 hematocrit has remained fairly stable over the past 12
   hours.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and plan to transfuse pt is hematocrit
   were to have a significant drop
   .
   # Bipolar D/o
   - will continue to hold patient
s psych medications
   - Lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine levels are WNL.
   .
   # Pneumothorax
 found on CXR yesterday
   - pt is stable from a respiratory standpoint
   - repeat CXR this morning.  Will review with team.
   .
   # HTN
 pts home BP meds were held yesterday.  Hydralazine was used PRN
   to control his BP.
   - continue to use hydralazine PRN for hypertension
   - could possibly restart pt
s atenolol is heart rate remains in an
   acceptable range

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte abnormalities. He has a history of bipolar disorder and is on multiple psychiatric medications. The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors, including hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium in the setting of the ICU. The patient has been treated with fluids to address rhabdomyolysis and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's continued confusion and hallucinations may be attributed to several factors such as hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium in the ICU setting. Close monitoring with neuro checks every two hours is recommended. Fluid administration will continue to treat rhabdomyolysis and hyponatremia. Head imaging might be considered due to the development of nystagmus and unexplained injuries, but this will be postponed until the patient is more cooperative.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure associated with rhabdomyolysis. Continued normal saline at 200 mL/hr, repletion of calcium and potassium as needed, and following renal recommendations are advised. Distal pulse checks will be done every four hours.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The etiology of rhabdomyolysis is unclear, as the patient reports falling but his history does not match the extent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with altered mental status, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, and a history of bipolar disorder. He is currently being treated for rhabdomyolysis, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and possible pneumothorax. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and various interventions have been implemented to address his medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion and hallucinations could be due to several factors, including hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium in the ICU setting. Continuous neuro checks and fluid administration are ongoing to address this issue.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure associated with rhabdomyolysis. Continued fluid administration with half-normal saline at 150 mL/hr and potassium repletion as needed are being implemented. Calcium repletion has been held per renal recommendations, and distal pulse checks are being performed every four hours.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The etiology of rhabdomyolysis is unclear, with the patient reporting a fall but his history not matching the extent of his bruising and rhabdo. Treatment is ongoing as previously mentioned, and a social work consult is pending.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is slowly correcting with fluids. Monitoring of electrolytes is being done every four hours to ensure sodium"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o M with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities with history of bipolar disorder on multiple psychiatric
   medications.
   #  Altered Mental Status
 pt had been having continued confusion and
   hallucinations.  Pt
s AMS could be due to several different factors,
   including his hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium
   in the setting of the ICU.
   - Will continue to monitor patient closely with q2hr neuro checks.
   - Continue to give fluids to help treat rhabdo and hyponatremia.
   - Given pt
s development of nystagmus and patient
s injuries that are
   not completely explained, would like to possibly get head imaging.
   Would hold off on this, however, until patient is more cooperative.
   .
   #  Acute Renal Failure
 likely associated with rhabdomyolysis
   - will continue 1/2NS at 150 mL/hr
   - will continue to replete potassium PRN
   - will hold off on repleting calcium per renal recommendations
   - will continue to follow any renal recommendations
   - also, will continue q4hr distal pulse checks
   # Rhabdomyolysis
 unclear etiology.  Pt reports having fallen, but his
   history does not match the extent of his bruising and rhabdo.
   - treat as above
   - awaiting social work consult
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 this is slowly correcting with fluids.  Pt did have a
   slight decrease when he was give potassium in sterile water.  However,
   expect that sodium will continue to rise when the patient starts
   receiving normal saline again.
   - continue 150mL/hr of 1/2NS
   - continue to monitor electrolytes regularly
 q4hrs
   .
   # Anemia
 hematocrit has remained fairly stable over the past 12
   hours.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and plan to transfuse pt is hematocrit
   were to have a significant drop
   .
   # Bipolar D/o
   - will continue to hold patient
s psych medications
   - Lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine levels are WNL.
   .
   # Pneumothorax
 found on CXR yesterday
   - pt is stable from a respiratory standpoint
   - repeat CXR this morning.  Pneumo looked improved.
   - will look at one more CXR tomorrow
   .
   # HTN
 pts home BP meds were held yesterday.  Hydralazine was used PRN
   to control his BP.
   - continue to use hydralazine PRN for hypertension
   - could possibly restart pt
s atenolol is heart rate remains in an
   acceptable range

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte abnormalities. He has a history of bipolar disorder and is on multiple psychiatric medications. The patient's AMS could be due to several factors, including hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium in the ICU setting. He is currently being treated for rhabdomyolysis and hyponatremia. The patient also has acute renal failure, unclear etiology, and is being treated accordingly. Other issues include anemia, bipolar disorder, pneumothorax, hypertension, and the use of IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued confusion and hallucinations due to hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium.
2. Acute renal failure may progress if not properly managed.
3. Rhabdomyolysis could lead to further complications if not treated adequately.
4. Anemia may worsen if not monitored and treated appropriately.
5. Pneumothorax may reoccur or worsen if not managed properly.
6. Hypertension might not be controlled with hydralazine alone, potentially leading to further complications.
7. Bipolar disorder may experience manic or depressive episodes if psychiatric medications are not managed correctly.
8. Infections such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) could develop due to the patient's immobility and prolonged ICU stay.
9. Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances may occur if fluid administration is not carefully monitored."

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several events, including rhabdomyolysis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and agitation/hallucinations. The patient has received multiple intravenous fluids, medications for agitation, and treatments for his conditions. His blood pressure has been difficult to control, requiring administration of hydralazine. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels. He also has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating muscle breakdown. The patient is currently on nasal cannula oxygen and has an unremarkable arterial blood gas (ABG) result.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: This is a condition characterized by severe muscle breakdown, which can lead to kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's labs indicate abnormalities in potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels. These imbalances can affect various organ functions and lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and nerve dysfunction.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's agitation and hallucinations may be due to electrolyte imbalances, medication side effects, or the underlying condition causing his admission. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin status is not assessed in the progress note"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o M with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities with history of bipolar disorder on multiple psychiatric
   medications.
   #  Altered Mental Status
 pt had been having continued confusion and
   hallucinations.  Pt
s AMS could be due to several different factors,
   including his hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium
   in the setting of the ICU.
   - Will continue to monitor patient closely with q2hr neuro checks.
   - Continue to give fluids to help treat rhabdo and hyponatremia.
   - Given pt
s development of nystagmus and patient
s injuries that are
   not completely explained, would like to possibly get head imaging.
   Would hold off on this, however, until patient is more cooperative.
   .
   #  Acute Renal Failure
 likely associated with rhabdomyolysis
   - will continue NS at 200mL/hr
   - will continue to replete calcium and potassium PRN
   - will continue to follow any renal recommendations
   - also, will continue q4hr distal pulse checks
   # Rhabdomyolysis
 unclear etiology.  Pt reports having fallen, but his
   history does not match the extent of his bruising and rhabdo.
   - treat as above
   - awaiting social work consult
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 this is slowly correcting with fluids.  Pt did have a
   slight decrease when he was give potassium in sterile water.  However,
   expect that sodium will continue to rise when the patient starts
   receiving normal saline again.
   - continue 200mL/hr of NS
   - continue to monitor electrolytes regularly
 q4hrs
   .
   # Anemia
 hematocrit has remained fairly stable over the past 12
   hours.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and plan to transfuse pt is hematocrit
   were to have a significant drop
   .
   # Bipolar D/o
   - will continue to hold patient
s psych medications
   - Lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine levels are WNL.
   .
   # Pneumothorax
 found on CXR yesterday
   - pt is stable from a respiratory standpoint
   - repeat CXR this morning.  Will review with team.
   .
   # HTN
 pts home BP meds were held yesterday.  Hydralazine was used PRN
   to control his BP.
   - continue to use hydralazine PRN for hypertension
   - could possibly restart pt
s atenolol is heart rate remains in an
   acceptable range

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte abnormalities. He has a history of bipolar disorder and is on multiple psychiatric medications. The patient's confusion and hallucinations may be due to hyponatremia, drug ingestion or withdrawal, or delirium. He has been given fluids to treat rhabdomyolysis and hyponatremia. The patient's development of nystagmus and unexplained injuries raise the possibility of head imaging, but it will be held off until the patient is more cooperative.

The patient likely has acute renal failure associated with rhabdomyolysis. He is being treated with normal saline at 200 mL/hr, and calcium and potassium are being repleted as needed. Distal pulse checks are done every four hours.

The etiology of the rhabdomyolysis is unclear, as the patient reports a fall but his history does not match the extent of his bruising and rhabdo. Social work has been consulted.

The patient's hyponatremia is slowly correcting with fluids, and sodium levels are expected to continue rising when the patient starts receiving normal saline again. Electrolytes are being monitored regularly.

The patient's hematocrit has remained fairly stable over the past 12 hours. It will be monitored, and the patient will be transfused if there is a significant drop in hematocrit.

 RHABDOMYOLYSIS
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   This is a 49 yo M with a history of bipolar disorder on multiple
   psychiatric medications who presents with confusion, profound
   hyponatremia, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis.
   #  Altered Mental Status - osm gap is 15, which is high. Has many
   reasons to be altered, including hyponatremia, uremia, drug or toxin
   ingestion. Renal feels that he likely dropped his sodium quickly.
   Ingestion is also high on the differential, given his osm gap. TTP is
   less likely given normal platelets here.
   - monitor closely
   - neuro checks q2h
   .
   #  Acute Renal Failure - likely ATN secondary to rhabdomyolysis with
   critically high CK and evidence of myoglobinuria. FeUrea is 62%.
   Abnormal ALT/AST likely muscle source. Unclear underlying etiology of
   his rhabdo - differential includes alcohol, drugs and toxins infections
   (including HIV), electrolyte abnormalities (unclear what was
   precipitant), endocrinopathies and inflammatory myopathy. NMS is also
   on the differential, but patient's tone and temperature were normal. No
   obvious signs of infection. Osm gap raises suspicion for ingestion,
   initial basic tox screens were only positive for benzos. A seizure is
   possible, as he lives alone. Diffuse ecchymoses could be indication for
   injury but history is vague. My suspicion is that the patient suffered
   traumatic attack given the extent of his injuries. It's unclear if he
   does not recall or if he does not feel safe to talk to us about it at
   this time.
   - renal c/s now
   - NS @ 75cc/hr continuous initially, transitioned to isotonic bicarb
   200cc/hr x 2L
   - monitor electrolytes Q2h for the next 6 hours- monitor carefully for
   worsening hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, acidosis, hyperkalemia from
   cellular injury.
   - 2g calcium IV now, check ionized calcium
   - social work c/s
   - psychiatry c/s
   - zofran prn for nausea
   - renal to look at sediment - appreciate recs
   - monitor for compartment syndrome with q4h distal pulses
   .
   # Hyponatremia - unclear etiology. ?psychiatric medications misuse or
   overdose, psychogenic polydipsia in the setting of ATN. Renal feels
   most likely the latter. Patient seems to think that this has happened
   to him in the past and it was med related, however denies any recent
   changes in medications or doses.
   - per renal not likely to drop sodium with isotonic bicarb but may
   shoot up too quickly, monitor very carefuly
   - Q2h neuro checks
   - Q2h electrolyte checks
   .
   # Anemia
 recheck hct in afternoon. T&S. Need blood consent.
   .
   # Bipolar D/o - holding all psych meds, await input from psych c/s. Do
   not want to exacerbate hyponatremia right now if possible. Ativan prn
   as needed for agitation (QTc prolonged would avoid haldol for now).
   .
   # Pneumothorax - right sided apical. Surgery evaluated. Will repeat CXR
   in afternoon to reevaluate. Patient stable from a respiratory
   standpoint.
   .
   # HTN - holding atenolol for HR in 50's, holding HCTZ for hyponatremia.
   Use hydralazine as needed for SBP>160.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder who presented with confusion, profound hyponatremia, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to multiple factors including hyponatremia, uremia, drug or toxin ingestion, and possibly traumatic injury. The patient has acute renal failure, critically high creatine kinase (CK) levels, evidence of myoglobinuria, and abnormal liver function tests indicating a possible muscle source. The underlying etiology of his rhabdomyolysis is unclear, with possibilities including alcohol or drug ingestion, electrolyte abnormalities, endocrinopathies, inflammatory myopathy, or a traumatic attack. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and aggressive repletion of electrolytes, particularly sodium. The patient also has anemia, a right-sided apical pneumothorax, and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are critically low, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not closely monitored and managed appropriately.
2. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels, which can lead to symptoms such as muscle cramps, cardiac arrhythmias, and tetany.
3. Acidosis: Due to renal failure and rhabdomyolysis, the patient may develop metabolic acidosis, which can affect organ function and overall health.
4. Hyperkalem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder who presents with rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), hypontatremia, and altered mental status. 

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. HypoNatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle cramps. The differential diagnosis includes medication-related causes like lamotrigine or HCTZ, ingestion of substances, or psychogenic polydipsia. The patient is being given normal saline at 150cc/hr to correct the sodium levels.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium, possibly with a component of hyponatremia. It is important to monitor neurologic status regularly and repeat head CT scans if needed.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has very high creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating ongoing muscle breakdown. He is being resuscitated with IV fluids.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is secondary to rhabdomyolysis. It is crucial to monitor renal function and dose medications accordingly, avoiding nephrotoxins.

5. Right Pneumothorax (PTX): Serial chest X-rays are necessary to monitor the PTX, and the trauma team will follow up with a repeat CX"

 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Very odd story of this 49 male with bipolar who presents after fall
   with rhabdo, dense renal failure, hypoNa, and altered mental status
   1.       HypoNatremia: DDX is med related with lamotrigine, HCTZ,
   versus ingestion, versus psychogenic polydipsia. Appreciate all renal
   reccs- we have given D5 w 3 AMPS bicarb and watched Na closely so as
   not to overcorrect Na too quickly but also to protect the kidneys with
   rhabdo. Will trend sodium q2 and ajust all meds closely.
   2.       Osm gap: recalculate with new labs
 will send ethylene
   glycol, have consulted tox and agree unlikely and out of window for
   fomepizole. Will trend closlet
   Rhabdo: very high CK with active ARF, needs aggressive IVF
 will
   start  D5W w 3 amps bicarb and transition to NS as possible. Watch UOP
   ARF: secondary to rhabdo but making urine now, renally doe all meds,
   avoid nephrotoxins,
   Right PTX: serial CXR, trauma team to follow reoeat CXR this evening.
   Altered Mental Status: unknown baseline, but hypoNa leds the list, need
   more baseline info, correcting Na with isotonic bicarb but have to
   carefully monitor lytes and q2 neuro checks. Likely repeat head CT here
   if can
t get OSH films  - but wre neg at that time. [**Month (only) 8**] need to reimage
   as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder who presented with rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, and altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving aggressive IV fluids to manage his condition. The medical team is closely monitoring his electrolyte levels and adjusting his medications accordingly. Additional tests and consultations have been ordered to further evaluate his condition, including a repeat head CT scan and imaging for a suspected right pneumothorax. The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in case of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HypoNatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or further deterioration in mental status.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's high levels of creatine kinase (CK) indicate ongoing muscle breakdown, which can lead to further kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances. Aggressive IV fluids are being administered to maintain urine output and protect the kidneys.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Secondary to rhabdomyolysis, the patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to an accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances. The medical team is taking measures to avoid nephrotoxins and closely monitoring renal function.
4. Altered Mental Status"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 49 yo M with a history of bipolar
   disorder on multiple psychiatric medications who presents with
   confusion, profound hyponatremia, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis.
   #  Altered Mental Status - osm gap is 15, which is high. Has many
   reasons to be altered, including hyponatremia, uremia, drug or toxin
   ingestion. Renal feels that he likely dropped his sodium quickly.
   Ingestion is also high on the differential, given his osm gap.
   - monitor closely
   -Try redirection for delirium.
   .
   #  Acute Renal Failure - likely ATN secondary to rhabdomyolysis with
   critically high CK and evidence of myoglobinuria. FeUrea is 62%.
   Abnormal ALT/AST likely muscle source. Unclear underlying etiology of
   his rhabdo - differential includes alcohol, drugs and toxins infections
   (including HIV), electrolyte abnormalities (unclear what was
   precipitant), endocrinopathies and inflammatory myopathy. NMS is also
   on the differential, but patient's tone and temperature were normal. No
   obvious signs of infection. Osm gap raises suspicion for ingestion,
   initial basic tox screens were only positive for benzos. A seizure is
   possible, as he lives alone. Diffuse ecchymoses could be indication for
   injury but history is vague. My suspicion is that the patient suffered
   traumatic attack given the extent of his injuries. It's unclear if he
   does not recall or if he does not feel safe to talk to us about it at
   this time.
   - renal c/s now
   - monitor electrolytes
   - social work c/s awaiting recs.
   - zofran prn for nausea
   - renal to look at sediment - appreciate recs
   .
   # Hyponatremia - unclear etiology. ?psychiatric medications misuse or
   overdose, psychogenic polydipsia in the setting of ATN. Renal feels
   most likely the latter. Patient seems to think that this has happened
   to him in the past and it was med related, however denies any recent
   changes in medications or doses.
   - per renal switched to NS.
   -Continue to follow lytes 1200/1800hrs.
   .
   # Bipolar D/o - holding all psych meds, await recs from psych c/s. Do
   not want to exacerbate hyponatremia right now if possible. Will try
   redirection and distraction for agitation but may use Haldol 2mg IV PRN
   and follow EKG to eval QTc (currently 463).  [**Month (only) 8**] also use Ativan
   however this made patient more delirious in past.
   -EKG to follow QTc
   .
   # Pneumothorax - right sided apical. Surgery evaluated. CXR repeated
   this AM, however patient supine making it difficult to evaluate small
   pneumothorax.  Once patient able to participate for PA/Lat will
   re-image.
   # HTN - holding atenolol for HR in 50's, holding HCTZ for hyponatremia.
   Use hydralazine as needed for SBP>160.
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes aggressively with hypoNa mgmt
   as above, regular diet with free water restriction.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder, presenting with confusion, profound hyponatremia, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. He is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion and high osmolar gap suggest possible drug or toxin ingestion, electrolyte abnormalities, or uremia. Monitoring and redirection techniques will be used to manage delirium.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to rhabdomyolysis, indicated by elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and myoglobinuria. The underlying etiology of rhabdomyolysis is uncertain and could be due to alcohol, drugs, infections, electrolyte abnormalities, endocrinopathies, or inflammatory myopathy.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has profound hyponatremia with an unclear etiology. Possible causes include psychiatric medications misuse or overdose, psychogenic polydipsia, or inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is essential.
4. Pneumothorax: The patient has a right-sided apical pneumothorax. Surgical evaluation is pending, and repeat chest X-ray will be done once the patient can participate in a PA/Lat view.

 RHABDOMYOLYSIS
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 49 yo M with a history of bipolar
   disorder on multiple psychiatric medications who presents with
   confusion, profound hyponatremia, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis.
   #  Altered Mental Status - osm gap is 15, which is high. Has many
   reasons to be altered, including hyponatremia, uremia, drug or toxin
   ingestion. Renal feels that he likely dropped his sodium quickly.
   Ingestion is also high on the differential, given his osm gap.
   - monitor closely
   - neuro checks q2h
   .
   #  Acute Renal Failure - likely ATN secondary to rhabdomyolysis with
   critically high CK and evidence of myoglobinuria. FeUrea is 62%.
   Abnormal ALT/AST likely muscle source. Unclear underlying etiology of
   his rhabdo - differential includes alcohol, drugs and toxins infections
   (including HIV), electrolyte abnormalities (unclear what was
   precipitant), endocrinopathies and inflammatory myopathy. NMS is also
   on the differential, but patient's tone and temperature were normal. No
   obvious signs of infection. Osm gap raises suspicion for ingestion,
   initial basic tox screens were only positive for benzos. A seizure is
   possible, as he lives alone. Diffuse ecchymoses could be indication for
   injury but history is vague. My suspicion is that the patient suffered
   traumatic attack given the extent of his injuries. It's unclear if he
   does not recall or if he does not feel safe to talk to us about it at
   this time.
   - renal c/s now
   - NS @ 75cc/hr continuous initially, transitioned to isotonic bicarb
   200cc/hr x 2L
   - monitor electrolytes Q2h for the next 6 hours- monitor carefully for
   worsening hyponatremia, hypocalcemia acidosis, hyperkalemia from
   cellular injury.
   - 2g calcium IV now, check ionized calcium
   - social work c/s
   - psychiatry c/s
   - zofran prn for nausea
   - renal to look at sediment - appreciate recs
   .
   # Hyponatremia - unclear etiology. ?psychiatric medications misuse or
   overdose, psychogenic polydipsia in the setting of ATN. Renal feels
   most likely the latter. Patient seems to think that this has happened
   to him in the past and it was med related, however denies any recent
   changes in medications or doses.
   - per renal not likely to drop sodium with isotonic bicarb but may
   shoot up too quickly, monitor very carefuly
   - Q2h neuro checks
   - Q2h electrolyte checks
   .
   # Bipolar D/o - holding all psych meds, await input from psych c/s. Do
   not want to exacerbate hyponatremia right now if possible. Ativan prn
   as needed for agitation (QTc prolonged would avoid haldol for now).
   -EKG to follow QTc
   -EEG per psych recs.
   .
   # Pneumothorax - right sided apical. Surgery evaluated. CXR repeated
   this AM, however patient supine making it difficult to evaluate small
   pneumothorax.
   # HTN - holding atenolol for HR in 50's, holding HCTZ for hyponatremia.
   Use hydralazine as needed for SBP>160.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder who presents with confusion, profound hyponatremia, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to multiple factors including hyponatremia, uremia, drug or toxin ingestion, and possibly psychiatric medication use. 

The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to rhabdomyolysis, which is supported by critically high creatine kinase (CK) levels and evidence of myoglobinuria. The abnormal liver enzymes (ALT/AST) suggest a muscle source. The underlying etiology of his rhabdomyolysis is unclear and may be related to alcohol, drugs/toxins, electrolyte abnormalities, endocrinopathies, or inflammatory myopathy.

The patient's condition also includes impaired skin integrity, profound hyponatremia, and a pneumothorax on the right side. The hyponatremia may have been caused by psychiatric medication misuse or overdose, psychogenic polydipsia in the setting of ATN, or other factors. The patient's history of bipolar disorder is being held for further evaluation by psychiatry.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. However, the patient's temperature is not within the normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder on multiple psychiatric medications. He presents with confusion, profound hyponatremia, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and hyponatremia raise the possibility of seizures. It is important to closely monitor the patient for any signs of seizure activity.

2. Worsening Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are critically low, and there is a risk of further worsening if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of electrolytes is essential to prevent complications related to rapid correction of sodium levels.

3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is on the lower end, and there is a risk of developing hypocalcemia. This can lead to symptoms such as muscle cramps, tingling, and cardiac arrhythmias. Calcium supplementation should be considered.

4. Hyperkalemia: Due to renal failure and cellular injury, the patient is at risk for hyperkalemia. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is necessary to prevent cardiac complications.

5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to renal failure and psychiatric medications puts him at an increased risk of infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for rhabdomyolysis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a history of alcohol use and was found to have ethanol on his breath. He has also shown signs of ptank, which is being monitored with follow-up chest X-rays. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing tachycardia. Fluid balance shows a total input of 5429 mL and output of 3290 mL since 12 AM. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 155/74 mmHg to 97/53 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 100% without any respiratory support. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and his skin examination is also not performed. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as low levels of potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and calcium (Ca++). The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is slightly elevated. The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of the patient's condition, management of rhabdomyolysis and electrolyte imbalances, and addressing the altered mental status.

   # Hyponatremia
 improving.   Most recent sodium this morning was 133.
   Continue
   - per renal switched to NS.
   -Continue to follow lytes 1200/1800hrs.
   # Hypokalemia
   #  Acute Renal Failure - likely ATN secondary to rhabdomyolysis with
   critically high CK and evidence of myoglobinuria. FeUrea is 62%.
   Abnormal ALT/AST likely muscle source. Unclear underlying etiology of
   his rhabdo - differential includes alcohol, drugs and toxins infections
   (including HIV), electrolyte abnormalities (unclear what was
   precipitant), endocrinopathies and inflammatory myopathy. NMS is also
   on the differential, but patient's tone and temperature were normal. No
   obvious signs of infection. Osm gap raises suspicion for ingestion,
   initial basic tox screens were only positive for benzos. A seizure is
   possible, as he lives alone. Diffuse ecchymoses could be indication for
   injury but history is vague. My suspicion is that the patient suffered
   traumatic attack given the extent of his injuries. It's unclear if he
   does not recall or if he does not feel safe to talk to us about it at
   this time.
   - renal c/s now
   - monitor electrolytes
   - social work c/s awaiting recs.
   - zofran prn for nausea
   - renal to look at sediment - appreciate recs
   #  Altered Mental Status
   - will continue to closely monitor patient
s mental status
   - continue to administer fluids for hyponatremia/rhabdo
   # Bipolar D/o - holding all psych meds, await recs from psych c/s. Do
   not want to exacerbate hyponatremia right now if possible. Will try
   redirection and distraction for agitation but may use Haldol 2mg IV PRN
   and follow EKG to eval QTc (currently 463).  [**Month (only) 8**] also use Ativan
   however this made patient more delirious in past.
   -EKG to follow QTc
   .
   # Pneumothorax - right sided apical. Surgery evaluated. CXR repeated
   this AM, however patient supine making it difficult to evaluate small
   pneumothorax.  Once patient able to participate for PA/Lat will
   re-image.
   # HTN - holding atenolol for HR in 50's, holding HCTZ for hyponatremia.
   Use hydralazine as needed for SBP>160.
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes aggressively with hypoNa mgmt
   as above, regular diet with free water restriction

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte imbalances. He has a history of bipolar disorder and is on psychiatric medications. The patient's current conditions include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis, and diffuse ecchymoses. There are also concerns about a possible traumatic attack or injury. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires close monitoring. The plan includes continuing aggressive fluid management, repletion of electrolytes, and holding certain medications temporarily.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: Given the patient's altered mental status and history of living alone, there is a possibility of seizure activity.
2. Infection: With the presence of rhabdomyolysis and altered mental status, the patient is at risk for developing infections.
3. Delirium: The patient's current agitation and altered mental status may lead to further episodes of delirium.
4. Pneumothorax: The patient has a right-sided apical pneumothorax, which requires careful monitoring and possible surgical intervention.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently being managed with hydralazine as needed for systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg.
6. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia and hypokalemia,"

   # Hyponatremia
 improving.   Most recent sodium this morning was 133.
   - continue to give patient NS at 200cc/hr
   - will recheck lytes at 1200
   # Hypokalemia
 pt received some potassium supplementation overnight.
   However, most recent potassium level was still low at 3.1.  Per
   nursing, pt did have some diarrhea overnight.
   - will give 40 meq of KCl PO
   - will recheck lytes at 1200
   #  Acute Renal Failure
 likely associated with rhabdomyolysis, as pt
   presented with a CPK of [**Numeric Identifier 7362**].  Pt did report falling, but his
   injuries were out of proportion to his history.
   - CPK trending down
 most recent value last night was [**Numeric Identifier 7357**]
   - BUN and Cr also trending down
 most recent were 61 and 3.5
   - continue to administer NS at 200cc/hr
   - follow-up renal consult
   - continue to monitor electrolytes
   - follow-up social work recommendations
   #  Altered Mental Status
 improved.  Per nursing, pt is no longer
   confusing or having hallucinations.  Off of restraints since 10pm last
   night.
   - will continue to closely monitor patient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is on psychiatric medications. The patient presented with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure likely associated with rhabdomyolysis, altered mental status, bipolar disorder, pneumothorax, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle cramps. It is important to continue NS at 200cc/hr and recheck electrolytes at 1200.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, which can cause muscle weakness, abnormal heart rhythms, and cardiac arrest. Potassium supplementation should be given, and the levels should be rechecked.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient may have rhabdomyolysis, indicated by high CPK levels and injuries disproportionate to the history. BUN and Cr are trending down, but close monitoring is required. Follow-up renal consult is needed.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved, but it is important to continue close monitoring. Fluids for hyponatremia/rhabdo should be continued.
5. Bipolar Disorder: Psych medications are currently held, but they may need to be restarted based on psych recommendations."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with altered mental status, multiple electrolyte imbalances, and a history of bipolar disorder. The patient presented with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure likely associated with rhabdomyolysis, and an altered mental status. The patient also has a history of pneumothorax, hypertension, and is currently on multiple psychiatric medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected properly.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, which can result in muscle weakness, abnormal heart rhythms, and cardiac arrest if not corrected promptly.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient may be at risk of further kidney damage due to the underlying rhabdomyolysis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications.
4. Bipolar Disorder: The patient's psychiatric condition needs careful attention and consideration for restarting psychiatric medications to manage mood stability and prevent manic or depressive episodes.
5. Pneumothorax: Although the small right-sided apical pneumothorax has improved, monitoring for any changes in respiratory status is crucial to detect any potential worsening of the condition.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed appropriately to prevent complications such as stroke or heart disease. Holding certain"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o M with altered mental status and multiple electrolytes with a
   history of bipolar disorder on multiple psychiatric medications.
   # Hyponatremia
 improving.   Most recent sodium this morning was 133.
   - continue to give patient NS at 200cc/hr
   - will recheck lytes at 1200
   # Hypokalemia
 pt received some potassium supplementation overnight.
   However, most recent potassium level was still low at 3.1.  Per
   nursing, pt did have some diarrhea overnight.
   - will give 40 meq of KCl PO
   - will recheck lytes at 1200
   #  Acute Renal Failure
 likely associated with rhabdomyolysis, as pt
   presented with a CPK of [**Numeric Identifier 7362**].  Pt did report falling, but his
   injuries were out of proportion to his history.
   - CPK trending down
 most recent value last night was [**Numeric Identifier 7357**]
   - BUN and Cr also trending down
 most recent were 61 and 3.5
   - continue to administer NS at 200cc/hr
   - follow-up renal consult
   - continue to monitor electrolytes
   - follow-up social work recommendations
   #  Altered Mental Status
 improved.  Per nursing, pt is no longer
   confusing or having hallucinations.  Off of restraints since 10pm last
   night.
   - will continue to closely monitor patient
s mental status
   - continue to administer fluids for hyponatremia/rhabdo
   # Bipolar D/o
 currently holding all psych meds per intial psych
   recommendations
   - will await psych recs on when to restart medications
   - can give 2mg Haldol PRN for agitation with follow-up EKG to check
   QTc.  Ativan has previously worsened pts agitation.
   .
   # Pneumothorax
 pt presented with a small right sided apical. Surgery
   evaluated and recommended follow-up CXR.  No worsening of the
   pneumothorax was noted on follow-up CXR
   - monitor for any changes in respiratory status
   - possibly get PA and lateral CXR now that pt
s altered mental status
   is improving
   # HTN
 at home, pt on atenolol and HCTZ
 atenolol held due to HR and
   HCTZ held due to hyponatremia
   - hydralazine PRN as needed for SBP>160.
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes PRN, regular diet with free
   water restriction

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving forced diuresis with normal saline (NS) due to renal insufficiency. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate between 60-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/70-176/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has a sinus rhythm. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. There are also signs of electrolyte imbalances, including low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. Liver enzymes are elevated, and there are abnormal results in cardiac markers and lactate levels. 

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired peripheral pulses, skin integrity, and neurologic assessment. 

Plan:
The patient's condition is complicated by rhabdomyolysis, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorders, and impaired skin integrity. The ICU care plan includes forced diuresis with NS, treating agitation with haloperidol, monitoring for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and considering transfer to the floor once stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 49 y/o M with a history of bipolar
   disorder on multiple psychiatric medications who presents with
   confusion, profound hyponatremia, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis.
   #  Altered Mental Status - osm gap is 15, which is high. Has many
   reasons to be altered, including hyponatremia, uremia, drug or toxin
   ingestion. Renal feels that he likely dropped his sodium quickly.
   Ingestion is also high on the differential, given his osm gap.
   - monitor closely
   -Try redirection for delirium.
   .
   #  Acute Renal Failure - likely ATN secondary to rhabdomyolysis with
   critically high CK and evidence of myoglobinuria. FeUrea is 62%.
   Abnormal ALT/AST likely muscle source. Unclear underlying etiology of
   his rhabdo - differential includes alcohol, drugs and toxins infections
   (including HIV), electrolyte abnormalities (unclear what was
   precipitant), endocrinopathies and inflammatory myopathy. NMS is also
   on the differential, but patient's tone and temperature were normal. No
   obvious signs of infection. Osm gap raises suspicion for ingestion,
   initial basic tox screens were only positive for benzos. A seizure is
   possible, as he lives alone. Diffuse ecchymoses could be indication for
   injury but history is vague. My suspicion is that the patient suffered
   traumatic attack given the extent of his injuries. It's unclear if he
   does not recall or if he does not feel safe to talk to us about it at
   this time.
   - renal c/s now
   - monitor electrolytes

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and multiple psychiatric medications. He presented with confusion, profound hyponatremia, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to several factors including hyponatremia, uremia, and potential drug or toxin ingestion. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to rhabdomyolysis with critically high creatine kinase (CK) levels and evidence of myoglobinuria. The underlying etiology of his rhabdomyolysis is unclear, with possible causes including alcohol, drugs and toxins, infections (including HIV), electrolyte abnormalities, endocrinopathies, and inflammatory myopathy. NMS (neuroleptic malignant syndrome) is also on the differential, but the patient's tone and temperature were normal. No obvious signs of infection were found. An elevated osmotic gap raises suspicion for ingestion, and initial basic toxicology screens were positive for benzodiazepines. A seizure is possible given that he lives alone. Diffuse ecchymoses could indicate injury, but the patient's history is vague. It is suspected that the patient may have suffered a traumatic attack, as the extent of his injuries suggests. The patient's hyponatremia is unclear in etiology, possibly related to psychiatric medications misuse or overdose, psychogenic polydipsia in the setting of acute tubular necrosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o M with altered mental status and multiple electrolytes with a
   history of bipolar disorder on multiple psychiatric medications.
   # Hyponatremia
 improving.   Most recent sodium this morning was 133.
   - continue to give patient NS at 200cc/hr
   - will recheck lytes at 1200
   # Hypokalemia
 pt received some potassium supplementation overnight.
   However, most recent potassium level was still low at 3.1.  Per
   nursing, pt did have some diarrhea overnight.
   - ordered 40 meq of KCl PO but pt was having some nausea
 switched to
   40 meq KCl IV
   - will recheck lytes at 1200
   #  Acute Renal Failure
 likely associated with rhabdomyolysis, as pt
   presented with a CPK of [**Numeric Identifier 7362**].  Pt did report falling, but his
   injuries were out of proportion to his history.
   - CPK trending down
 most recent value last night was [**Numeric Identifier 7357**]
   - BUN and Cr also trending down
 most recent were 61 and 3.5
   - continue to administer NS at 200cc/hr
   - follow-up renal consult
   - continue to monitor electrolytes
   - follow-up social work recommendations
   #  Altered Mental Status
 improved.  Per nursing, pt is no longer
   confusing or having hallucinations.  Off of restraints since 10pm last
   night.
   - will continue to closely monitor patient
s mental status
   - continue to administer fluids for hyponatremia/rhabdo
   # Bipolar D/o
 currently holding all psych meds per intial psych
   recommendations
   - would like to restart pt
s psych meds if possible - will talk to
   psych about restarting meds
   - can give 2mg Haldol PRN for agitation with follow-up EKG to check
   QTc.  Ativan has previously worsened pts agitation.
   .
   # Pneumothorax
 pt presented with a small right sided apical. Surgery
   evaluated and recommended follow-up CXR.  No worsening of the
   pneumothorax was noted on follow-up CXR
   - monitor for any changes in respiratory status
   # HTN
 at home, pt on atenolol and HCTZ
 atenolol held due to HR and
   HCTZ held due to hyponatremia
   - hydralazine PRN as needed for SBP>160
   - pt should not be restarted on HCTZ ever, considering the profound
   hyponatremia on admission
 will add HCTZ to pt
s list of allergies

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with altered mental status and multiple electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is on psychiatric medications. The patient presented with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure (likely associated with rhabdomyolysis), altered mental status, bipolar disorder, pneumothorax, and hypertension.

The patient's sodium levels are improving, but potassium levels remain low. The patient's renal function is slowly improving, as indicated by decreasing BUN and creatinine levels. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is no longer experiencing confusion or hallucinations. The patient's pneumothorax has stabilized, and there are no current concerns regarding respiratory status.

The patient's current medications include IV fluids, potassium supplementation, and hydralazine for blood pressure control. The patient's bipolar disorder medications have been temporarily held, but it is planned to restart them if possible. The patient is currently not on any psychotropic medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are still within a concerning range, although they are improving. Care should be taken to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.

2. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels remain low despite potassium supplementation. Close monitoring and continued supplementation are necessary to avoid cardiac complications.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving"
