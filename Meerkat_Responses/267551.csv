   prolonged ICU hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 11669**] complicated by
   persistent fevers and leukocytosis, discharged [**12-13**] after trach and
   peg placement and on a course of linezolid for VRE isolated from
   peripheral line on [**12-9**], now found to have recurrent fevers.
   #  Fever: Found to have T of 105 today at rehab.  Source is most likely
   severe L sided pneumonia seen on CXR.  Given recent discharge would
   treat for Hospital acquired pneumonia. It is reassuring that patient
   has blood cultures from [**12-8**], [**12-9**], [**12-14**] that are no growth to date.
   Urine and Urine culture was sent in ED. C diff sent from ED has
   returned negative, however having persistent diarrhea. Other sources
   include Subclavian line. Unclear where and when that was placed. Of
   note, patient had VRE growing from peripheral line on [**12-9**]. Initially
   prescribed 1 week course, but would favor treating for 2-3 weeks until
   surveillance blood cultures are negative.
   -remove subclavian -consider PICC line placement if for longterm abx

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, and recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts. He has been hospitalized in the ICU and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. He was discharged after completing a course of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolated from his peripheral line. The patient presented with recurrent fevers, which were initially attributed to VRE infection. However, further investigations ruled out Clostridium difficile infection and urinary tract infection. A CT chest scan showed resolving pneumonia, and a CT abdomen/pelvis did not reveal any intraabdominal source of infection. The plan is to continue linezolid for treatment of VRE and add Zosyn for empirical coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Blood cultures are being monitored, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) is scheduled to evaluate the patient's continued fevers given the positive blood culture with VRE. The patient is also being treated for HAP, and consideration is being given to re-siting the central venous line if the patient continues to have positive blood cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent fevers: The patient's persistent fevers may indicate an ongoing infection or other underlying medical condition. Further evaluation is needed to identify the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of CAD/CHF, atrial fibrillation, and recent pontine/cerebellar infarct. He was previously hospitalized for a possible VRE line infection and is now readmitted with fevers up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. He has been discharged once but was readmitted due to persistent low-grade temperatures. The patient has been on various medications including coumadin, NPH, simvastatin, MVI, metoprolol, and nystatin. He is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) - The patient's persistent low-grade temperatures indicate a possible ongoing infection or other underlying medical condition.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient has been ventilator-dependent throughout his last hospitalization, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
3. Central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection - The patient's previous hospitalization was complicated by a possible VRE line infection, and he now has a central venous catheter in place, which can increase the risk of bloodstream infections.
4. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) - The patient has been on prolonged antibiotic therapy, which increases the risk of developing CDI.
5. Chronic respiratory failure - The patient requires long-term mechanical ventilation, indicating chronic respiratory failure.
6. Atrial fibrillation - The patient has a history of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib) on coumadin, recent pontine/cerebellar infarct, and hospitalization complicated by possible vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) line infection. The patient was readmitted after less than 24 hours of discharge due to persistent fevers. He continues to have no localizing symptoms, and his temperatures have been low-grade.

The patient is currently ventilator-dependent and has chronic respiratory failure. He is also on anticoagulation therapy for his recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). His blood sugar levels are well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Persistent fever: The patient's fevers are still present despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. This could indicate an ongoing infection or other underlying cause that needs further investigation.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for any changes in his respiratory status and consider repeating sputum cultures.

3. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient's previous hospitalization complicated by possible VRE line infection raises concerns for a central line-associated bloodstream infection. The healthcare team should assess the integrity of the central"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, and recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and required prolonged hospitalization. During his stay, he developed persistent fevers and leukocytosis. He was discharged after tracheostomy and peg placement, and was started on linezolid for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolated from a peripheral line. 

Currently, the patient is experiencing recurrent fevers despite negative C. difficile test and urinalysis. His chest X-ray shows no worsening of prior pneumonia, and a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis reveals no intraabdominal source of infection. The plan is to continue linezolid for the treatment of VRE and add zosyn for empirical coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Surveillance blood cultures are being followed, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed today to evaluate the cause of continued fevers given the recent positive blood culture with VRE.

The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, and metoprolol will be continued as per outpatient regimen. Coumadin will be held due to a supratherapeutic INR, and INR will be monitored daily. The patient will also be monitored on telemetry.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), morbid obesity, and recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts requiring prolonged ICU hospitalization. The patient was discharged on [**12-13**] after tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and was on a course of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolated from a peripheral line on [**12-9**]. 

The patient's current condition includes persistent fevers and leukocytosis. The recent blood cultures are pending, and the patient's urine culture was negative. The CT chest shows no worsening of prior pneumonia, and the CT abdomen/pelvis shows no signs of an intra-abdominal source of infection. 

The plan is to continue linezolid for the treatment of VRE drawn from the peripherally inserted intravenous (PIV) line on [**12-9**] and to continue Zosyn for empirical coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Surveillance blood cultures will be obtained, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed today for the evaluation of continued fevers given recent positive blood cultures with VRE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and a recent pontine/cerebellar infarct. He was previously hospitalized and had a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) infection. He was discharged but readmitted after less than 24 hours due to persistent fevers. The patient's current condition includes being on mechanical ventilation, having an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC), and a positive blood culture from the CVC tip. He also has a tracheostomy tube in place, and his chest X-ray shows a left lower lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, while his blood glucose level is within normal range. His electrolytes are also within normal limits, except for a slightly low magnesium level. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.3Â°F (39.1Â°C), blood pressure of 131/73 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is on prophylactic heparin sodium, linezolid, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of a tracheostomy tube increase the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary to detect any potential infection early on.

2. Central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (CABSI): The patient's positive blood culture from the CVC tip suggests a possible CABSI. It is important to assess the patient's signs of infection, such as fever and chills, and monitor his blood cultures to ensure that the infection does not spread.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's immobility and the use of systemic anticoagulation, there is an increased risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment of his lower extremities for signs of edema or pain will help in early detection.

4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and the presence of an indwelling PEG tube increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular turning and repositioning of the patient, as well as proper skin assessment, are crucial in preventing these complications.

5. Medication interactions: The patient's multiple comorbidities and the use of various medications may increase the risk of drug interactions. Close monitoring of his medication regimen and regular review of his drug levels will be necessary to ensure therapeutic effects without adverse reactions.

6. Neurological complications: Given the patient's recent pontine/cerebellar infarct, there is a risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), morbid obesity, and recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts. The patient has been hospitalized in the ICU for a prolonged period and has been on a course of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated from a peripheral line. The patient presented with fevers and leukocytosis, and blood cultures obtained from the subclavian line are pending. The patient's temperature was 101.9 degrees overnight. CT chest and abdominal/pelvic scans did not show any worsening of prior pneumonia or signs of an intraabdominal source of infection. The patient's current medications include metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and linezolid. The plan is to continue linezolid for the treatment of VRE and Zosyn for empiric coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Surveillance blood cultures will be monitored, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be considered due to the recent positive blood cultures with VRE. The patient's tracheostomy tube site will be evaluated by a wound nurse, and bronchoscopy with possible tapping of left effusion will be considered. The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with met"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, and recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been hospitalized for a prolonged period. The patient has been discharged once before after tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement, and was on a course of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolated from a peripheral line. The patient now presents with recurrent fevers, despite being on linezolid and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for VRE and potential hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The fever is not of unknown origin. Blood cultures obtained overnight were negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) twice and urine analysis (UA) and urine culture (Ucx) were also negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest shows no worsening of prior pneumonia, and a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis reveals no signs of an intra-abdominal source of infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fevers. The patient's medical history includes chronic respiratory failure and he has been receiving various medications and treatments for his condition. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a temperature of 38.8Â°C (101.9Â°F), and he is experiencing atrial fibrillation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a blood pressure of 89/69 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with mechanical ventilation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,338 mL and output of 1,790 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood work reveals leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin at 11.3 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 113 to 125 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever - The patient has persistent fever despite receiving antibiotics. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Monitoring and optimization of respiratory support will be necessary.
3. Nutrition - The patient is receiving Boost Glucose Control for nutrition and glycemic control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), recent pontine/cerebellar infarct, and hospitalization complicated by possible vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) line infection. He was discharged but re-admitted due to persistent fevers. The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures since discharge. He has a fever of 101.9Â°F, is on mechanical ventilation, and has been diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and atrial fibrillation. He is currently being treated with antibiotics, statin, beta-blocker, and non-pharmacological interventions for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The ICU team is implementing measures to prevent VAP, such as head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been placed on systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin to prevent the formation of blood clots in the deep veins.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent the development of stress"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a recent pontine/cerebellar infarct. He was previously hospitalized and had a possible VRE line infection. He is currently admitted to the ICU with ongoing fevers and an indwelling central venous line. His vital signs show a temperature of 101.9Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 115/56 to 165/106 mmHg, heart rate between 89 and 106 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and he is on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The results also show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function tests, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase. The patient has negative microbiology results to date.

Radiology images show persistent left lower lobe opacities/effusion. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's fever is still unlocalized, and there is a broad differential diagnosis including pulmonary sources, bloodstream infection, or other sources. The patient is currently on antibiotics, specifically linezolid for the suspected VRE line infection and piperacillin-tazob"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and a recent pontine/cerebellar infarct. He was previously hospitalized and had a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) line infection, as indicated by persistent fevers and a positive culture from the catheter tip. He was discharged but re-admitted after less than 24 hours due to ongoing fevers.

The patient is currently on several medications, including linezolid for a history of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection, piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) to cover possible pulmonary Gram-negative rods, and famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

His vital signs show a temperature of 101.9Â°F (38.8Â°C), blood pressure ranging from 115/56 mmHg to 165/106 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, clear breath sounds bilaterally, and soft, non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), morbid obesity, and recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts requiring prolonged ICU hospitalization. He was discharged on [**12-13**] after tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and on a course of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to persistent fevers and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient continues to have recurrent fevers with no known cause. CVL has been removed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was negative for vegetations. No growth has been observed in any cultures.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation and requires backup support for central apnea.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation. He will continue with metoprolol and resume coumadin with an INR target of 1.8-2.0.
4. Multiple recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts: The patient's neurologic exam and mental status are currently at baseline. Neurology agrees that CNS fe"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), morbid obesity, recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts, and prolonged ICU hospitalization. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers and leukocytosis. He was discharged [**12-13**] after tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and on a course of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolated from a peripheral line on [**12-9**]. Currently, the patient continues to have recurrent fevers despite no known cause, removal of central venous line (CVL), negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for vegetations, and no growth in any cultures. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and recurrent fevers suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Further investigations, such as thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema, may be necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently tracheostomized and weaned to pressure support (PS) 5/5 but still needs backup support for central apnea. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings may"

The patient was previously hospitalized and had a possible VRE line infection. He was discharged but readmitted due to persistent fevers. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 102.3Â°F (39.1Â°C), blood pressure of 127/92 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on the ventilator. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient also has right and left lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Imaging reveals a left pleural effusion, and microbiology results indicate a negative gram stain from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever: The patient continues to have persistent fevers, which are likely due to a broad differential diagnosis including linezolid-associated fever, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), or other sources of infection. Linezolid has been discontinued as there is"

   Total time spent: 20 minutes
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and a recent pontine/cerebellar infarct. He was admitted to the ICU due to possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a VRE line infection. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, and the catheter tip culture was positive for VRE.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, but no localizing signs or symptoms. The differential diagnosis for fever is still broad. Linezolid was started for the suspected VRE line infection, but it will be discontinued on [**12-23**] as there is no evidence of a new acute infection.
2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient is ventilator-dependent and has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well. He also has intermittent central apneas, even while awake. MMV mode has been initiated, and daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) will be conducted to evaluate for apneas. If the apneas resolve, a trial of tracheal extubation may be attempted. However, these apneas may be central in origin and therefore likely permanent.
3. Prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The patient is on anticoagulation therapy and is currently holding coumadin due to an elevated INR caused by antibiotics.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Vital signs show a temperature of 103.1Â°F, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/82 mmHg to 138/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and prolonged prothrombin time. Blood cultures have been taken on multiple occasions, but no organism has been identified yet. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically linezolid and piperacillin/tazobactam, but the fever persists.

The patient has been on Coumadin (warfarin) since December 19th with an INR target of 2. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned for Friday. The patient has not had a pleural effusion tap due to insufficient fluid.

The patient's weight has remained relatively stable since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,689 mL and output of 1,445 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 244 mL. Respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with mechanical ventilation mode set at MMV/PSV/AutoFlow, with a tidal volume of 500 mL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), morbid obesity, and recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts requiring prolonged ICU hospitalization. He was discharged [**12-13**] after tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and on a course of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated from a peripheral line on [**12-9**]. The patient is currently admitted with recurrent fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers with no known cause. This could potentially lead to complications such as sepsis or multisystem inflammatory response syndrome (MIS).

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires respiratory support due to respiratory failure. This puts him at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation. This increases the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke, and requires close monitoring of cardiac function and anticoagulation therapy.

4. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF, which can worsen during periods of stress or infection, potentially leading to acute decompens"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), morbid obesity, and recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts requiring prolonged ICU hospitalization. He was discharged [**12-13**] after tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and on a course of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated from the peripheral line on [**12-9**]. Now, he presents with recurrent fevers. 

His current vital signs include a temperature of 103.1Â°F (39.5Â°C), heart rate of 104 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 90/60 mmHg to 138/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is mechanically ventilated through a tracheostomy tube in pressure support mode with mandatory minute volume (MMV). 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 282 K/uL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 174 IU/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of large pontine and cerebellar cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and resultant vent dependence. He is currently readmitted to the ICU after less than 24 hours out of the hospital with fevers up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and chronic respiratory failure. He is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including linezolid, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and warfarin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central fever: The patient's high fever could be central in nature, which may require further evaluation using techniques such as transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to rule out any endocarditis or other occult infections.
2. Prostatitis or osteomyelitis: There is a low suspicion for other occult sites of infection, including the prostate or bones. Further investigation may be needed to rule out these possibilities.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's chronic respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation, he is at an increased risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving anticoagulation prophylaxis to reduce the risk of developing DVT while being immobile in the ICU.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is on stress ulcer proph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of large pontine and cerebellar CVA, resulting in vent dependence. He is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient's vital signs indicate an elevated body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. 

The patient's recent medical history includes being readmitted less than 24 hours after discharge due to fevers reaching up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including linezolid and piperacillin/tazobactam. He is also on Coumadin (warfarin) for an unspecified condition.

Physical examination reveals an obese patient who is able to nod in response to yes/no questions. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops heard in the cardiovascular examination. The abdominal examination shows a PEG tube site. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's condition.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been within normal limits. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Imaging studies, including a CT scan, bronchoscopy, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), have"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of posterior strokes, persistent fevers, and central respiratory failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has been febrile with no known cause, despite negative cultures. He is also experiencing atrial fibrillation and respiratory failure, specifically having apnea at night. Additionally, the patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is receiving insulin therapy. He has a feeding tube in place but has been unable to tolerate feeds, and there is a need for an interventional radiology evaluation of the feeding tube. The patient's family has been notified, and they can be contacted at the provided numbers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and negative cultures suggest the possibility of a drug fever or unidentified infection. Sepsis is a potential complication that needs to be closely monitored and managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's central respiratory failure indicates that he is unable to breathe adequately on his own. This places him at risk for further deterioration in respiratory function and may require increased ventilatory support.
3. Stroke: The patient's history of posterior strokes increases his risk for complications such as cerebral edema, hemorrhage, or neurological decline.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to complications such as thromboembolism or arrhythmia-related hemodynamic instability.

   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8860**], whose note above
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 50 y/o man with
   pontine/cerebellar CVA in [**Month (only) 1148**] (with reported central apneas) now is
   readmitted with high-grade fevers.  Source is not completely apparent.
   Seen by ID today, who recommended TEE, which is planned for tomorrow.
   Other diagnostic maneuvers (including bronchoscopy) unrevealing.  Will
   follow cultures and continue present rx.  Once past acute phase with
   fevers, could consider trial of central respiratory stimulants (e.g.
   see [**Doctor First Name **] Intern Med. [**2132**] [**3-26**];130(5):427-30).  Other issues as per Dr.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of large pontine and cerebellar CVA (cerebrovascular accident) in [**11-2**] and resultant vent dependence (intermittent central apnea), who was readmitted after less than 24 hours out of the hospital with fevers up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV/PSV/AutoFlow). The vital signs show a temperature of 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/71 to 172/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation and chronic respiratory failure. The physical examination findings are as follows: general appearance of an obese patient who nods head to yes/no questions, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), tracheostomy site clean and dry, regular S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops, PEG tube site clean and dry, and peripheral pulses not assessed.

The laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.0 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 394 thousand/mm3, sodium level of 139 mEq/L, potassium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old individual with a large pontine and cerebellar CVA, resulting in vent dependence. They were readmitted to the ICU after less than 24 hours out of the hospital due to fevers reaching 105Â°F. The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. They also have atrial fibrillation and are being treated with metoprolol and coumadin. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 104.4Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 117/71 to 172/105 mmHg, heart rate between 89 and 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and weight of 153.4 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient's high fever indicates an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for central line-associated bloodstream infection.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of clot formation and subsequent embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy with medications like coumadin is typically indicated to reduce this risk.

3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and close monitoring of the patient's"

 Breathing over the ventilator frequency.
       Although history of needing MMV he may tolerate ongoing PS at this
       point. He was unable to augment tidal volume signirficantly at
       beside so it may be worth  checking  a NIF.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old individual with a history of large pontine and cerebellar CVA, resulting in vent dependence and intermittent central apnea. They were readmitted to the ICU after less than 24 hours out of the hospital due to fevers reaching 105Â°F.

The patient has a temperature of 104.4Â°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/71 mmHg to 172/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. They are currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV/PSV/AutoFlow) with a set tidal volume of 643 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory support device is a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's weight is 153.4 kg, and their height is 72 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,666 mL (including 359 mL of IV fluids) and an output of 1,625 mL (including 320 mL of blood products), resulting in a positive balance of 2,041 mL. The patient has not had their peripheral pulses or skin assessed.

Laboratory results show the following values: hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 221 K/uL,"

 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan:
    1. Fevers- likely central in nature.  Plan for TEE tomorrow.  Bronch,
       TTE, CT neg. No lines.   Pleural effusion not amenable to
       drainage.  Low suspiction for other occult sites, prostatis,
       osteomyelitis.   Awaiting TEE neg TEE.  Given troubles with G-tube,
       would get G-tube contrast study to confirm placement. ID consult
       pending.   LLL consolidation concerning.  Will repeat CT and
       consider repeat bronchoscopy.
    2. Afib
 metoprolol/coumadin
    3. Chronic resp failure
 Breathing over the ventilator frequency.
       Although history of needing MMV he may tolerate ongoing PS at this
       point. He was unable to augment tidal volume signirficantly at
       beside so it may be worth  checking  a NIF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, large pontine and cerebellar cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and resultant ventilator dependence.
- He was readmitted to the ICU after less than 24 hours out of the hospital with high fevers.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- He is currently on multiple medications including Linezolid and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 104.4Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 117/71 mmHg to 172/105 mmHg, heart rate between 79-120 bpm, respiratory rate of 12-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
- He is obese and has tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range.
- Other lab results indicate normal levels of electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes, and bilirubin.
- The patient's chest X-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation.
- The assessment and plan include investigating the cause of the fever, considering a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and ruling out occult sources of infection such as prostatis or osteomyelitis.
- The patient's chronic respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation are being managed accordingly.
- The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeding (TFs) and is on glucose control.
- He is at high risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stress ulcers, for which prophylactic measures are being taken.
- The patient's disposition is in the ICU, and he is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's chronic respiratory failure and prolonged ventilator dependence, he is at increased risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy would be necessary.
2. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's persistent high fevers despite negative imaging studies suggest the possibility of an underlying infection or other causes. Further investigation, such as the planned TEE, is warranted to identify the source of the fever.
3. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure puts him at risk for further deterioration in lung function. Close monitoring of respiratory status and ongoing management of respiratory support are essential.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy is appropriate, and efforts should be made to control heart rate and rhythm.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of a PEG tube increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications,"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of posterior strokes, persistent fevers, and central respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned, but the 24-hour events include ID consultation recommendations, adjustments to medications, and a change in PEG tube evaluation.

The patient has several ongoing problems, including fever (hypothermia/pyrexia/not fever of unknown origin), atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, feeding issues, and possible pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.9Â°F), heart rate of 85 bpm with an irregular rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 103/51 mmHg to 131/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and within normal limits for blood glucose. Other lab values, including liver enzymes and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, tracheostomy site assessment, regular heart sounds without murmurs, and no abdominal tenderness. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

The plan includes continuing linezolid for VRE bacteremia until December"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old individual who has been admitted to the ICU due to a large pontine and cerebellar stroke (CVA) in November 2nd. As a result of the stroke, the patient is now dependent on a ventilator for breathing support.

The patient was readmitted to the ICU after being discharged less than 24 hours ago due to recurrent fevers reaching up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's vital signs currently show a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/37 to 131/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on metoprolol and coumadin for this condition. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure and is being ventilated through the ventilator with a mode called MMV (pressure-controlled ventilation with spontaneous breaths). 

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 7.9 to 12.0 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level ranging from 31.3 to 36.7%, platelet count ranging from 347 to 394 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level ranging from 93 to 127 mg/dL, and various electrolyte levels within normal"

   with active bowel sounds. No tenderness. Extremities warm. !+ edema.
   Appears to be responding to antibiotics. Would continue present

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a large pontine and cerebellar CVA, resulting in ventilator dependence. He presented with intermittent central apnea and was readmitted after less than 24 hours out of the hospital with fevers reaching 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient is currently afebrile for 36 hours.

Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient's recurrent fevers are likely central in nature, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is being awaited. Other potential sources of infection, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, prostatitis, and osteomyelitis, have been ruled out through negative tests. An ID consult is appreciated, and the patient has a low suspicion for other occult sites of infection.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with metoprolol and coumadin.

3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure and is breathing over the ventilator frequency. Although he has a history of needing mandatory minute ventilation (MMV), he may tolerate ongoing pressure support (PS) at this point. His negative inspiratory force (NIF) is 40.

Potential Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, fecal incontinence, and previous VRE bacteremia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been intubated with a tracheostomy tube.

Overnight, the patient did well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) without mandatory minute volume (MMV). The healthcare team plans to attempt weaning to tracheostomy mask during the day, even if requiring ventilator support overnight, to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

A new CT chest reveals small airspace opacities in the left lower lung, which are consistent with atelectasis. There is also a new dependent posterior left upper lobe opacity that has a similar atelectatic appearance, but pneumonia cannot be definitively excluded. No pleural effusion is present.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 109/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) without mandatory minute volume (MMV).
- There are plans to wean the patient to a tracheostomy mask during the day, even if they require ventilator support at night, to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- A CT chest scan showed small airspace opacities in the left lower lung, which is likely atelectasis. There is also a new dependent posterior left upper lobe opacity that appears atelectatic but cannot be ruled out as pneumonia. No pleural effusion is present.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on [**2142-12-22**] at 07:49 PM.
- The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications and other medications.
- The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged from admission except for the noted changes.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), current temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F), heart rate of 94 bpm with a range of 85-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/76 mmHg to 168/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute with a range of 12-24 breaths"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Did well on PSV overnight without MMV; will try to wean to trach mask
   during the day even if requiring vent support overnight to reduce VAP
   risk
   - CT chest: Small airspace opacities in the left lower lung, in a
   different distribution than on the CT of seven days earlier, most
   consistent with atelectasis. New dependent posterior left upper lobe
   opacity has a similar atelectatic appearance, but pneumonia cannot be
   definitively excluded. No pleural effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, fecal incontinence, and previous ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/76 to 168/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator.

The patient has small airspace opacities in the left lower lung, indicating possible atelectasis or pneumonia. No pleural effusion is present. The patient's recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. His glucose levels are within normal limits, except for one reading of 113 mg/dL.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has had episodes of fever in the past, which recurred without an obvious source. Cultures have remained negative. Drug fever should be considered, especially since the patient was previously on meropenem, which was stopped on 12/19. Linezolid was started for a 14-day course for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (V"

   I was physically present with the housestaff team for discussion of the
   above history, physical, data and assessment and plan with which I
   agree.   I would add the following comments.
   Patient is a 50 yo male admit with significant fever and current
   investigations for possible source has concluded with possible
   pulmonary source of infection with improvement with fever decrease
   across time but will with recurrence to 100.4.  All investigations for
   specific source have been without clear results for focal source
   leaving LLL opacity as perhaps most likely.
   EXAM-
   Oral cavity with very poor dentition
anterior teeth able to be
   visualized only and no focal abscess seen.
   Assessment and plan
By problems
   1)Fever-Source remains to be defined
patient currently with 48 hours
   without fever but has had recurrence this evening with temp to 100.4
   -Will continue with antibiotics
   -Will pursue panorex film when able for possible abscess.  If indicated
   or with recurrent high fevers would consider CT scan of head and neck.
   Addition issues to be addressed as defined in the above note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a large pontine and cerebellar CVA in 11-2, resulting in vent dependence and intermittent central apnea. He was readmitted to the ICU after less than 24 hours out of the hospital due to high fevers. The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has had recurrent fevers, but is currently afebrile for 48 hours. The possible sources of infection include drug fever due to famotidine and a pulmonary source, which is still under investigation.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has AFib, for which he is being treated with metoprolol and coumadin.

3. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient requires long-term ventilation support and has tolerated pressure support last night. He is expected to undergo tracheostomy sprinting soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is critically ill and immobile, there is an increased risk of DVT. Prophylactic anticoagulation has been initiated.

3. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a large pontine and cerebellar CVA, resulting in vent dependence and intermittent central apnea. He was readmitted to the ICU with fevers reaching up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/76 to 168/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been afebrile for the past 48 hours and has shown improvement in his condition. However, he still requires ongoing medical support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient initially presented with recurrent fevers, which have now resolved. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection or drug fever.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with metoprolol and coumadin.
3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV mode, a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures is necessary.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest. Prophylactic anticoagulation is being administered.
6. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored and managed to maintain glycemic control.
8. Tracheostomy Care: The patient is planned for tracheostomy care, including tracheostomy tube changes and suctioning.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires ongoing monitoring and management of his medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is currently on a tracheostomy (trach) mask for respiratory support. The patient has been febrile to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday afternoon, but is currently afebrile over 96 hours. Cultures have remained negative, and there is no obvious source of infection. The patient's fever was initially suspected to be due to famotidine. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation and is currently in normal sinus rhythm. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and oxygen saturation is within normal limits. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities. The patient's neurologic examination reveals that he is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24500 cells/microliter, elevated hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 31 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and liver function tests are normal. The patient's glucose level is well-controlled.

Microbiology reports indicate the presence of >25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes and <10 epithelial cells per 100X field, with 1+ gram-positive cocci seen in pairs and clusters. 

Plan:

1. Continue current antibiotics until instructed by the Infectious Disease specialist to stop, for coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Perform transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today.
3. Evaluate possible tooth abscess with a CT scan of the maxillary region.
4. Continue Metoprolol 25mg orally three times a day as per outpatient regimen for atrial fibrillation.
5. Continue on Coumadin, with goal International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2-3, and switch to heparin drip due to subtherapeutic levels recently.
6. Monitor INR daily and keep the patient on telemonitoring.
7. Maintain the patient on trach mask during the day to decrease the chance of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Control diabetes mellitus type 2 with NPH insulin 30 units subcutaneously twice daily and sliding scale regular insulin.
9. Provide enteral nutrition via feeding tube as tolerated.
10. Administer sucralfate and bowel regimen for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
11. Monitor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation using heparin.
12. Elevate head of bed (HOB) and provide mouth care for VAP prevention.
13. Consider transfer to a long-term acute care facility after the TEE.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Measures such as elevating the head of the bed and providing oral hygiene should be continued to minimize the risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures like compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation should be continued.
3. Infectious complications: The patient has been febrile, and while cultures have remained negative, there is still a possibility of an undiagnosed infection. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
- 50-year-old male with a history of cerebellar pontine infarct and chronic respiratory failure.
- Admitted to ICU with high fevers and undergoing infectious evaluation.
- Tolerating tracheal mask without recurrence of apneic episodes.
- Currently on multiple medications including Lopressor, Coumadin, Simvastatin, Insulin sliding scale, NPH, and Heparin.
- Recent lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.6 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 37.5 g/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 348 K/uL.
- Blood cultures have been sent due to febrile status.
- Assessment and plan include evaluating for possible endocarditis, considering maxillofacial CT, monitoring for recurrent apneic episodes, and managing atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's high fevers and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. Possible complications could include sepsis, septic shock, or dissemination of infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which may lead to complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory acidosis, or hypoxemia.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which could lead to complications such as stroke, thromboembolism, or arrhythmias.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with recent pontine and cerebellar strokes admitted to the ICU for fevers of unclear etiology. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.1Â°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 109/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and there is a concern for an underlying infection. The presence of periapical dental abscesses seen on CT suggests a possible dental source of infection. Additionally, the positive Gram stain indicating the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters raises the possibility of bacterial infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin is recommended to prevent clot formation. Close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) is essential to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Maintaining the patient on a tracheostomy mask during"
