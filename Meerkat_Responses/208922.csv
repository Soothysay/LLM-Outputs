","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with acute pancreatitis. She has been intubated for tachypnea and experienced aspiration during the intubation process. The patient also has a lower left lobe pneumonia. Imaging shows a non-obstructing stone in the ampulla of Vater with duodenal inflammation, but no biliary or pancreatic duct dilation. There is a small area of necrosis in the pancreatic tail and a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas around the superior mesenteric artery. The patient has significant abdominal ascites.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low, which can be a result of pancreatitis. This condition needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to pneumonia and witnessed aspiration during intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, but the plan is to extubate her if feasible.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient had aspiration during intubation, leading to aspiration pneumonia. She is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram+, gram-, anaerobes, and MRSA.
4. Infection: With the presence of a pseudocyst and necrosis in the pancreas, there is a risk of infection. The patient's blood cultures have been obtained, and she is being covered with appropriate antibiotics.
5. Ileus: The patient is advised against tube feeds due to the recommendation of starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and the concern for ileus.
6. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure Prophylaxis) should be considered.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with acute pancreatitis. The cause of pancreatitis is uncertain, but it could be due to alcohol abuse or a stone in the ampulla of Vater. The patient also has pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration and volume overload. 

The patient was intubated for tachypnea and transferred for further evaluation of pancreatitis involving possible ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). The patient's condition has been complicated by the formation of a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas around the superior mesenteric artery, small areas of necrosis in the pancreatic tail, and significant abdominal ascites.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode, set at a tidal volume (Vt) of 463 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 67.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to either alcohol abuse or a stone at the ampulla of Vater. The patient also has pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration and volume overload. The patient was intubated for tachypnea and transferred for further workup of pancreatitis involving a possible ERCP.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with PSV/SBT ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated, awake, and following commands. Her HEENT examination shows no abnormalities, and her CV examination reveals regular rhythm without murmurs. Her lungs show decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, with crackles in the lateral lung fields. Her abdomen is soft, tender to palpation, with hypoactive bowel sounds. Her extremities are warm, well perfused, and without edema.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and glucose level of 92 mg/d"

- Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
- Heart rate: 105 bpm
- Blood pressure: 132/79 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 603 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and PIP of 10 cmH2O. Her ABG results show pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 26 mmHg, PaO2 of 103 mmHg, HCO3- of 28.5 mEq/L, BE of -3 mEq/L, and base excess of -7 mEq/L.

The patient has received various medications, including levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a chief complaint of acute pancreatitis. She has a history of alcohol abuse and was admitted for further evaluation and management. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. She is mildly delirious post-extubation but improved overnight. The patient is currently on clears and receiving supportive care. It is recommended to consider an ERCP once she improves clinically. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and abscess formation.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress post-intubation could indicate the development of pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. This may require further respiratory support and antibiotics.
3. Alcohol abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse increases the risk of recurrent pancreatitis, liver disease, and other complications related to alcohol consumption.
4. Delirium: Post-extubation delirium can progress to more severe conditions like ICU delirium or acute psychosis. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections.
6. Thromboembolism: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention. However, there is still a"
