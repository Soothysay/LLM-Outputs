   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo m with hx of COPD and prior left pneumothorax, now presenting at
   OSH with respiratory distress and found to have right pneumothorax, s/p
   intubation and chest tube, now extubated
   .
   # Respiratory Distress/Pneumothorax: Pt has long hx of severe COPD and
   prior hx of pneumothorax, placing pt at risk for spontaneous pneumo.
   Also there is some concern for recent exacerbation and increased
   coughing, which may have caused his pneumo. Chest tube is in place and
   on suction with resolved pneumothorax on recent cxr
   - extubated today
   - chest tube to wall suction, will repeat CXR in AM and then consider
   water seal
   - appreciate IP recs
   - see below for COPD care
   .
   # COPD/asthma hx: Pt has hx decreased lung function with obstructive
   disease. Per report of son pt had increased cough and SOB at home, this
   is concerning for a COPD exacerbation. Possible infection, since WBC is
   elevated to 17. However no clear fevers. Had Solu-Medrol 125mg at OSH
   today.
   - d/c azithromycin
   - ipratropium q6 hours
   - albuterol q6 hours
   - clarify home COPD meds
   - hold off on further abx for now
   - sputum cx ordered
   - monitor blood cx
   .
   # Demand Ischemia: Pt has a mildly elevated Trop and an elevated CK.
   EKG without concerning changes for ACS. Pt likely had demand ischemia
   from resp distress. CE are down trending, and pt with no chest pain, so
   likely not ACS.
   - no asa due to allergy
   - will monitor BP and restart meds
   .
   # Afib: EKG today in sinus. Unclear hx and home meds, was on dilt ER
   240 in [**2152**]
   - if HR elevated will start short acting dilt
   .
   # HTN: Unclear hx and meds, normotensive currently
   - will do med reconciliation today and restart meds
   .
   # ? Upper GI bleed: NGT fluids with dark heme+ contents. Low volume,
   concern for bleed from GI bleed vs from traumatic ET tube placement.
   Was on PPI in past, may have prior GI hx. Could have gastritis from
   stress of situation. Hct is stable.
   - change PPI to PO daily
   - guaiac stool
   - NPO for now
   - if continues will c/s GI for possible EGD
   - daily Hct

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD and prior left pneumothorax. He presented at OSH with respiratory distress and was found to have a right pneumothorax. The patient underwent intubation and chest tube placement, and is now extubated.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Distress/Pneumothorax: The patient's long history of severe COPD and prior pneumothorax put him at risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. There is concern for recent exacerbation and increased coughing, which may have caused his pneumothorax. The chest tube is in place and on suction with resolved pneumothorax on recent chest X-ray.

2. COPD/asthma history: The patient has a history of decreased lung function with obstructive disease. There is concern for a COPD exacerbation due to increased cough and shortness of breath at home. The elevated white blood cell count suggests possible infection, but no clear fevers are present. The patient received Solu-Medrol at OSH today.

3. Myocardial Infarction (MI)/Ischemia: The patient has mildly elevated troponin and an elevated CK level, indicating possible demand ischemia from respiratory distress. However, the EKG did not show concerning changes for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and the cardiac enzymes are trending downwards"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, prior left pneumothorax, and recent right pneumothorax. He presented with respiratory distress and was intubated. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since October 26th. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 115/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's EKG is in sinus rhythm.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pleural Effusion, Acute: The patient has a right pneumothorax, which has been treated with a chest tube on suction. The plan is to trial water seal later today with a repeat chest X-ray in the evening.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed, Other (GI Bleed, GIB): The patient has dark heme-positive NGT fluids, suggesting a possible GI bleed. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source and severity of the bleed.
3. Demand Ischemia: The patient has mildly elevated troponin and CK levels, but no concerning changes on the EKG. It is likely that the patient experienced demand ischemia due to respiratory distress.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's EKG is currently in sinus rhythm, but there is an unclear history and home medication regimen for atrial fibrillation. Monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient presented with a spontaneous pneumothorax in the context of a cough/COPD exacerbation and was intubated for severe respiratory distress. The patient has now been extubated and is doing well. A CT scan has been placed on low wall suction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient's primary concern is the spontaneous pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax recurs or does not resolve completely, it may lead to respiratory distress and further complications.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's cough/COPD exacerbation could potentially worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and difficulty breathing.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had an unclear episode of gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to traumatic NG tube placement. If this bleeding recurs or is not managed appropriately, it could result in significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
4. Elevated White Blood Cell Count: The patient's elevated WBC count may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory response. Monitoring for signs of infection or fever is important to prevent or manage potential complications.
5. Myocardial Infarction: The patient had slightly elevated troponin levels, which may suggest a myocardial infarction. Ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess cardiac function and prevent further cardiac events.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As a precautionary measure, the patient is being given subcutaneous heparin for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation and is currently extubated. There is still an air leak present, so the plan is to continue with wall suction and perform a repeat chest X-ray in the morning. Azithromycin has been discontinued, and the patient is now on clears (ADAT). Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being maintained. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/76 mmHg to 160/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin and pantoprazole. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other labs are within normal range. The patient has a pleural effusion and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's code status is full code. Disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The presence of an air leak and ongoing respiratory distress may lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of ARDS.
2. Bleeding Complications: The gastrointestinal bleed, along with the use of anticoagul"

   # Respiratory Distress/Pneumothorax: Pt has long hx of severe COPD and
   prior hx of pneumothorax, placing pt at risk for spontaneous pneumo.
   Also there is some concern for recent exacerbation and increased
   coughing, which may have caused his pneumo. Chest tube is in place and
   on suction with resolved pneumothorax on recent cxr
   - extubated today
   - chest tube to wall suction, will repeat CXR in AM and then consider
   water seal
   - appreciate IP recs
   - see below for COPD care
   .
   # COPD/asthma hx: Pt has hx decreased lung function with obstructive
   disease. Per report of son pt had increased cough and SOB at home, this
   is concerning for a COPD exacerbation. Possible infection, since WBC is
   elevated to 17. However no clear fevers. Had Solu-Medrol 125mg at OSH
   today.
   - d/c azithromycin
   - ipratropium q6 hours

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD and prior left pneumothorax, presenting with respiratory distress and found to have a right pneumothorax. He was intubated and had a chest tube placed, now extubated. The patient has long-standing severe COPD and a previous history of pneumothorax, placing him at risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. There is concern for recent exacerbation and increased coughing, which may have caused the pneumothorax. The chest tube is in place and on suction, with resolved pneumothorax on recent chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory distress is due to COPD exacerbation with possible infection indicated by elevated white blood cell count. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of severe COPD and previous pneumothorax, putting him at risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. The recent exacerbation and increased coughing may have caused the pneumothorax.
2. COPD/Asthma Hx: The patient has a history of decreased lung function with obstructive disease. The increased cough and shortness of breath at home suggest a COPD exacerbation. Possible infection is indicated by the elevated white blood cell count.
3. Demand Ischemia: The patient has mildly elevated troponin and an elevated CK level, indicating possible myocardial ischemia due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo m with hx of COPD and prior left pneumothorax, now presenting at
   OSH with respiratory distress and found to have right pneumothorax, s/p
   intubation and chest tube, now extubated
   .
   # Respiratory Distress/Pneumothorax: Pt has long hx of severe COPD and
   prior hx of pneumothorax, placing pt at risk for spontaneous pneumo.
   Also there is some concern for recent exacerbation and increased
   coughing, which may have caused his pneumo. Chest tube is in place and
   on suction with resolved pneumothorax on recent cxr
   - extubated yesterday
   - Changed to water-seal; recheck cxr this pm and consider d/c CT if no
   PTX residual.
   - see below for COPD care
   .
   # COPD/asthma hx: Pt has hx decreased lung function with obstructive
   disease. Per report of son pt had increased cough and SOB at home, this
   is concerning for a COPD exacerbation. Possible infection, since WBC is
   elevated to 17. However no clear fevers. Had Solu-Medrol 125mg at OSH
   today.
   - ipratropium q6 hours
   - albuterol q6 hours
   - on advair in lieu of symbicort which is his home medication
   - hold off on further abx for now
   - sputum cx sent
   - monitor blood cx
   .
   # Demand Ischemia: Pt has a mildly elevated Trop and an elevated CK.
   EKG without concerning changes for ACS. Pt likely had demand ischemia
   from resp distress. CE are down trending, and pt with no chest pain, so
   likely not ACS.
   - no asa due to allergy
   - will monitor BP and restart meds
   .
   # Afib: EKG today in sinus. Unclear hx and home meds, was on dilt ER
   240 in [**2152**]
   - if HR elevated will start short acting dilt
   .
   # HTN: Unclear hx and meds, normotensive currently
   - will do med reconciliation today and restart meds
   .
   # ? Upper GI bleed: possible traumatic NGT placement, hct stable.

The patient was admitted with a spontaneous pneumothorax and respiratory failure. They were extubated and doing well, with a CT scan still to be suctioned. The patient has allergies to aspirin and unknown medications. They were given various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, albuterol, atrovent, heparin subcutaneously, and diltiazem.

The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 78 bpm with a range of 77-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111-160 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute with a range of 17-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient had sinus rhythm and fluid balance was within normal limits.

Physical examination revealed a well-nourished patient with no acute distress. The cardiovascular examination showed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral pulses were not assessed. Respiratory examination showed symmetric chest expansion and diminished breath sounds throughout. The abdominal examination was soft and non-tender. There was trace edema in both lower extremities. The skin was warm, and neurologic examination showed the patient attentive with normal tone.

Lab results indicated elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels were within normal limits, while troponin T levels were slightly elevated. Imaging revealed"

","The patient is a 26-year-old male who presented with a spontaneous pneumothorax and respiratory failure. He has been extubated and is currently on room air with a nasal cannula. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 155/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and his peripheral pulses are not assessed. The respiratory system examination shows diminished breath sounds throughout the chest. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and he has trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologically, he is attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 226 K/uL, blood glucose level of 101 mg/dL, sodium level of 139 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and troponin T level of 0.04. Imaging studies reveal that the chest tube is in good position and there is no pneumothorax on the right side.

The patient's plan includes continuing with advanced airway management, weaning from mechanical ventilation, and monitoring for potential complications such as"
