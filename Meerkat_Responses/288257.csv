","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, active alcohol abuse, and previous alcohol withdrawal seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with hepatic failure and hypotension. The patient received 7 liters of crystalloid and started on levophed for blood pressure support. She was seen by a liver consult in the emergency department and received oral vitamin K. Her discriminant function was 71, so she was started on prednisone 40mg daily for alcoholic hepatitis.

The patient has allergies to Librium, erythromycin base, and Vasotec. Her last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. She is currently receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.06 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include morphine sulfate, protonix, folic acid and thiamine, lactulose 30mg QID, and prednisone 40mg daily.

   given worsening mental status.  He noticed that she was drinking 1
   liter of vodka per day.  He forced her to stop and then after that she
   was drinking 3-4 beers per day.  She had a male friend that would
   provide her with klonopin 2mg pills (5 pills at a time).  She was only
   drinking beer and taking klonopin but not eating any other food or
   leaving her bed.  The son then left for two days after getting into a
   fight with his mother's male friend for one day and then his mother's
   friend stated that she was becoming more jaundice and was brought to
   the hospital.
   -per son the only medication is metformin
   -per son she is currently full code but will come in for a meeting w/
   the medical team tomorrow [**12-27**].  He also requests if she improves that
   she has a prolonged 3 month inpt stay somewhere to prevent her from

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of hep C and ETOH-related cirrhosis who presented from another hospital with acute hepatic failure. The likely cause of her acute decompensation is alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's current condition includes acute hepatic failure, ETOH abuse, anemia, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), hyponatremia, hypoxia, diabetes mellitus (DM), feeding tube (FEN), prophylaxis for stress ulcers (PPX), and access line (ACCESS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing mild confusion and somnolence, which could be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition occurs due to the buildup of toxins in the blood that are normally removed by the liver.
2. Infection: The patient has signs of volume overload and intraperitoneal hemorrhage, which increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring for any signs of infection is necessary.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and elevated bleeding time indicate an increased risk of bleeding. Any signs of bleeding should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can further complicate her condition. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management is crucial.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate hypotension, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of hep C and ETOH-related cirrhosis presenting from another hospital with acute hepatic failure. She has a history of alcohol abuse and was found to have intraperitoneal hemorrhage likely from paracentesis, volume overload, and worsening mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is hypotensive and has an elevated bladder pressure. She has been on pressors, but they were weaned off at 3:30 AM on 12/27. Her laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and INR, indicating liver dysfunction. She also has hyponatremia, hypoxia, and acute kidney injury. The patient is currently full code and will have a family meeting tomorrow to discuss code status and further treatment options.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's worsening mental status and elevated INR suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver dysfunction.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient had a paracentesis, which may have been performed to remove ascites fluid. SBP is a potential complication of cirrhosis with ascites.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's acute kidney injury with a low fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa < 1%) suggests HRS, a type of renal failure seen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of hep C and alcohol-related cirrhosis who presented to the hospital with acute hepatic failure. She has a history of alcohol abuse and was found to be drinking heavily before admission. The patient's current condition includes confusion, somnolence, asterixis, mild jaundice, and icterus. She also has an elevated bilirubin level, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and low platelet count.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hepatic Failure: The patient's history of cirrhosis and recent alcohol abuse likely contributed to her acute hepatic failure. This is indicated by elevated bilirubin levels and PT/INR, as well as the presence of asterixis and confusion.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which could be due to significant end-stage liver disease or an infectious cause. She has been weaned off pressors since 3:30 a.m. on 12/27.
3. Anemia: The patient has experienced bleeding into the intraperitoneal space, leading to a drop in hemoglobin concentration. Guaiac negative stools indicate no evidence of active bleeding.
4. Ethanol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and thiamine, folate, and multivitamins have been given daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of hep C and alcohol-related cirrhosis presenting from another hospital with acute hepatic failure. The patient has a background of chronic alcohol abuse, as reported by her son. She was admitted with confusion, jaundice, and intraperitoneal hemorrhage. On examination, she is slightly dry, jaundiced, and has asterixis with mild confusion and somnolence. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 97/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 34/83), elevated total bilirubin (27.5 mg/dL), low albumin (2.6 g/dL), prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR: 28.0/2.7), and elevated white blood cell count (17.7 K/uL). The patient has been started on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and her blood cultures and peritoneal fluid are pending. 

The patient's medical complications include acute hepatic failure, anemia due to intraperitoneal bleeding, hypotension possibly related to end-stage liver disease or infection, acute renal failure with a FeNa < 1%, hypoxia related to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HCV and cirrhosis, admitted with worsening confusion and hepatic insufficiency. She has a MELD score of 27 and is experiencing multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is displaying confusion and altered mental status, which can be a sign of hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Infection: The patient's blood cultures and peritoneal fluid cultures are pending, indicating a concern for infection. The chest CT shows peribronchial edema, thickening, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), trace bilateral effusions, ascites, and pancreatic calcifications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to cirrhosis or an infectious cause.
4. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage: There is a concern for an intraperitoneal bleed, as evidenced by the HCT drop after paracentesis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's urine output was poor yesterday, with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) less than 1. This may indicate renal failure, potentially due to hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
6. Hypoxia and volume overload: The patient is on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and has signs of fluid overload, with a positive fluid balance"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HCV and cirrhosis, admitted with worsening confusion and hepatic insufficiency. She has a MELD score of 27, indicating severe liver disease. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including hypotension, renal failure, hypoxia, volume overload, and potential intraperitoneal hemorrhage. She is also at risk for alcohol withdrawal, and her nutritional status needs to be closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may be due to cirrhosis-related complications or an infectious cause. This requires close monitoring and appropriate management to maintain adequate blood flow and organ perfusion.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output has been poor, with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) <1, suggesting prerenal azotemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of renal failure, which could be related to hepatorenal syndrome, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or contrast nephropathy. Management includes fluid resuscitation, optimization of hemodynamics, and the use of medications like albumin and vasopressors if necessary.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is below normal levels, indicating impaired gas exchange. This could be due to pulmonary edema, infection, or other factors. Appropriate oxygen supplementation and treatment of the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of hep C and alcohol-related cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital with acute hepatic failure and subsequently developed respiratory failure and acute kidney injury. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypoxia. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including hepatic failure, renal failure, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay, there is an increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and acute hepatic failure increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can present with altered mental status and hallucinations.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening hypoxia and the presence of bilateral patchy densities on imaging are consistent with ARDS, a life-threatening lung condition that occurs in response to various insults.
4. Hepato-renal syndrome: The combination of hepatic failure and renal failure raises the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure that occurs in advanced liver disease.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of hep C and ETOH-related cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital with acute hepatic failure and presented from another hospital. The patient's past medical history includes alcoholic hepatitis, anemia (likely due to bleeding into the intraperitoneal space), ETOH abuse, hypotension (possibly due to infectious cause or end-stage liver disease), acute renal failure (ARF) with FeNa < 1%, hypoxia (92% on 4L NC), hyponatremia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and poor oral intake (FEN). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 100%. Her vital signs include a blood pressure of 71/54 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hepatic Failure: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and presented with acute hepatic failure. She requires ongoing monitoring of liver function tests and management of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
2. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia due to bleeding into the intraperitoneal space. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of bleeding and determine appropriate management.
3. ETOH Abuse: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 ARDS vs volume overload.  Plateaus
   elevated, bilateral infiltrates.
   - Hold diuresis for now while hypotensive
   - Keep PaO2 >60, try to increase PEEP if needed
 HYPOTENSION
 Worse post-intubation.  Likely due to sedation and
   PEEP, but cannot exclude worsening infection, although no fever or
   elevated WBC.  Did have hemo-peritoneum, although Hct stable.  Also had
   steroids stopped recently.
   - Broaden antibiotics, add vanco and cefepime
   - TTE, CvO2
   - Pan culture
   - Start stress dose hydrocortisone
   - q6h
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 Tbili and INR stable
   - Add rifaxamin
   - Continue lactulose
   - stress dose hydrocortisone as above
Anemia
 Stable yesterday, but given hypotension will trend q6h, space

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with acute-on-chronic hepatic failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated. The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse. Her current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, and renal failure. 

Respiratory failure is indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on imaging. Hypotension is a concern as the patient's blood pressure is low and there has been an increase in pressor requirement. Anemia is present, although stable, and will be monitored closely. Renal failure is also noted, with an improvement in urine output after albumin administration.

The patient's liver function tests show elevated bilirubin levels and an elevated INR, indicating liver dysfunction. Other lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, platelet count, kidney function tests, liver enzymes, and coagulation profile.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspicion of infection. Stress-dose hydrocortisone has been initiated to manage potential adrenal insufficiency. Other medications include proton pump inhibitors, sedatives, analgesics, and diuretics.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her multiple organ dysfunctions. She should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration, including worsening respiratory distress, changes in mental status, and further decline in organ function."

   elevated, bilateral infiltrates.
   - Hold diuresis for now while hypotensive
   - Keep PaO2 >60, try to increase PEEP if needed
 HYPOTENSION
 Worse post-intubation.  Likely due to sedation and
   PEEP, but cannot exclude worsening infection, although no fever or
   elevated WBC.  Did have hemo-peritoneum, although Hct stable.  Also had
   steroids stopped recently.
   - Broaden antibiotics, add vanco and cefepime
   - TTE, CvO2
   - Pan culture
   - Start stress dose hydrocortisone
   - q6h
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 Tbili and INR stable
   - Add rifaxamin
   - Continue lactulose

Laboratory results indicate an elevated bilirubin level, low albumin level, high liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR), and low platelet count. Blood cultures were obtained, including blood and peritoneal fluid. 

The patient's diagnosis includes respiratory failure, hypotension, liver cirrhosis, anemia, and renal failure. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, rifaximin, lactulose, stress-dose hydrocortisone, and IV insulin protocol. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to ARDS or volume overload, further deterioration of renal function, development of hepatic encephal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with acute on chronic hepatic failure. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been intubated. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure, as well as increased oxygen requirements. She has a history of allergies to Librium, erythromycin, and Vasotec. Her current medications include fentanyl, norepinephrine, propofol, pantoprazole, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and increasing pressor requirements. She also has an elevated respiratory rate and is on ventilator support with a FiO2 of 100%. Her physical exam shows icteric sclera, coarse bronchial sounds, and slightly distended abdomen. Lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal coagulation profile. Imaging shows diffuse bilateral fluffy infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. The ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's liver failure and elevated bilirubin levels, hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication. This condition can cause confusion, altered mental status, and"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Meets ARDS criteria.  Etiology of
   infiltrates unclear, differential ARDS/PNA, DAH, cardiogenic edema.
   - Switch back to AC, 4-6cc/kg of IBW TV, will aim to keep PIPs~45
   pending new esophageal balloon numbers
   - Inhalers standing to minimize resistance
   - Consider bronchoscopy to r/o DAH, although tenuous respiratory status
 HYPOTENSION/SHOCK
 Per vigileo, minimal SVV, cardiac output ~[**5-2**],
   unclear if this is sufficient as improved with dopa.  Lactate is
   worsening, as is LDH, will re-evaluate for intra-abdominal process.
   Had been favoring a septic/distributive process, although cannot
   exclude a cardiac component.
   - On Neo, vaso, levophed, dopa
   - Follow-up cultures, on broad spectrum abx
   - Consider Swann placement
   - TTE, cycle biomarkers
   - Increase thiamine dose
   - RUQ US w/dopplers
   - Cdiff
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 Stable Tbili, INR up somewhat
   - On rifaxamin, lactulose
   - Appreciate hepatology input

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with acute on chronic hepatic failure. She is currently in respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 85% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 25 cmH2O. She is also on multiple pressor agents including vasopressin, dopamine, and phenylephrine. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 122 bpm and hypotension with a blood pressure of 90/54 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and altered coagulation profile. Her renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level. The blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) with unclear etiology. She requires ongoing support with mechanical ventilation and high FiO2.
2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to septic shock secondary to a possible intra-abdominal process or cardiac dysfunction. She is receiving multiple pressor agents to maintain blood pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   Gravely ill, with persistent respiratory failure, persistent severe
   hypotension, progressive academia and metabolic acidosis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Meets ARDS criteria.  Etiology of
   infiltrates unclear, differential ARDS/PNA, DAH, cardiogenic edema.
   - Switch back to AC, 4-6cc/kg of IBW TV, will aim to keep PIPs~45
   pending new esophageal balloon numbers
   - Inhalers standing to minimize resistance
   - Consider bronchoscopy to r/o DAH, although tenuous respiratory status
   at this time.
   HYPOTENSION/SHOCK
 Per vigileo, minimal SVV, cardiac output ~[**5-2**],
   unclear if this is sufficient as improved with dopa.  Lactate is
   worsening, as is LDH, will re-evaluate for intra-abdominal process.
   Had been favoring a septic/distributive process, although cannot
   exclude a cardiac component.  Sepsis sources include SBP, bowel
   ischemia, urinary source, line-related infection, C. diff.
   - On Neo, vasopressin, levophed, dopa
   - Follow-up cultures, on broad spectrum abx
   - Consider Swan-Ganz placement
   - TTE, cycle biomarkers
   - Increase thiamine dose
   - RUQ US w/dopplers
   - Cdiff
   ACIDOSIS
 progressive, lactic acidosis.  Concern for evolving sepsis,
   although at risk for bowel ischemia.  Doubt thiamine deficiency (as
   received iv thiamine dose).  Monitor ABG, lactic acid.  HCO3 drip as
   needed to maintain pH >7.20.
   CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 Stable Tbili, INR up somewhat
   - On rifaxamin, lactulose
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   - Will need FFP prior to procedures
   RENAL FAILURE
 Decreased UOP since midnight, with elevated Cr.  Poor
   dialysis candidate at this time.
   - Follow UOP with volume challenge

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis who presented with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and worsening lactic acidosis. She remains intubated and mechanically ventilated with increased oxygen requirements and high PEEP. Multiple vasopressors are being used to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP). There is evidence of worsening renal function and elevated liver enzymes. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS and there is uncertainty regarding the etiology of infiltrates. She has a history of multiple sepsis sources, including SBP, bowel ischemia, urinary source, line-related infection, and C. diff.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure due to ARDS.
2. Hypotension and shock, potentially due to septic shock or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Worsening lactic acidosis, indicating poor tissue perfusion and possible evolving sepsis.
4. Acute kidney injury due to hypoperfusion and possible bowel ischemia.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy or worsening hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis.
6. Potential need for renal replacement therapy or dialysis due to renal failure.
7. Risk of further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Complications related to the use of vasopressors, such as arrhythmias or end-organ damage."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, currently experiencing respiratory failure and hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving multiple treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with an elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her oxygen saturation is within normal range. The patient has a history of allergies to Librium, erythromycin, Vasotec, and confusion/delirium. She has received various antibiotics since admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications. These may include:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to liver failure increases her susceptibility to infections. The presence of multiple cultures being drawn suggests a concern for infection.
2. Septic Shock: The hypotension and unstable vitals could indicate septic shock, which is a life-threatening complication of infection.
3. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome: The patient's respiratory failure and altered mental status could progress to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, where multiple organs fail due to systemic inflammation.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy is a possible complication, characterized by confusion and altered mental status.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The low urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate a"

   # Shock: at this point seems to be related to possible infectious
   cause, end stage liver disease, propofol.  Would also consider adverse
   reaction to FFP or IV vitamin K.  On levo, vaso.
   - MAP goal > 55
   - empiric vanc/zosyn/cipro
   - stress dose steroids
   - follow UOP, pulse pressure variation to assess intravascular volume
   - check ECHO

   # Respiratory failure/ARDS:  Worsening hypoxia on [**12-27**] and intubated
   in setting of receiving volume and severe liver disease.  Differential
   includes volume overload versus infection versus pulm hemorrhage vs
   TROLI in setting of transfusion though unlikely.  Would also consider

   has seemed to respond to albumin challenge).  Contrast nepropathy
   (although worsening renal function occurred too early for this) or ATN
   as pts w/ hepatic disease can have FeNa < 1%.  At this point will avoid

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol-related cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital with acute hepatic failure and has developed multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic failure, and hypotension requiring vasopressors. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs, increased lactate levels, and worsening hepatic function. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-negative bacteria. She is receiving stress dose steroids and has been administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). There is a concern for possible adverse reactions to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or intravenous vitamin K. The patient's family has been informed about the situation, and the code status is set to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-negative bacteria, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. She is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but if the infection spreads or if resistant organisms are involved, additional interventions may be required.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and acute hepatic failure, which increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause confusion, altered"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yoF w/ a h/o hep C and ETOH related cirrhosis presents from [**Hospital 3296**]
   hospital with acute hepatic failure.
   # Shock: sepsis versus hepatic failure.
   - MAP goal > 55
   - empiric vanc/zosyn/cipro
   - stress dose steroids
   - follow UOP, pulse pressure variation to assess intravascular volume
   - possible swan ganz catheter plcmt today to further evaluate
   hemodynamics, especially given good BP and Cardiac index response to
   dopamine
   - check ECHO
   - wean fentanyl
   - q6hrs lactate
   -send c diff
   # Respiratory failure/ARDS:  intubated related to ARDS.
   -ECHO
   -possible swan plcmt
   -ARDSnet ventilation
   -attempt to wean FiO2
   .
   # Acute hepatic failure:
   -f/u liver recs
   -steroids
   -AFP normal
   -lactulose and rifaximin
   # ARF: FeNa < 1%.  Cr has stabilized, ddx includes pre-renal azotemia
   that has now started to improve, hepatorenal (although Cr not above 1.5
   and pt does have other reason to have renal failure such as shock, also
   has seemed to respond to albumin challenge).  Contrast nepropathy
   (although worsening renal function occurred too early for this) or ATN
   as pts w/ hepatic disease can have FeNa < 1%.  At this point will avoid
   further volume depletion, monitor urine output.
   - follow UOP and trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   # Anemia: bleeding likely into intraperitoneal space.  Guaiac negative
   and hct stable.
   -guaiac stools
   -active type and screen
   -transfuse for hct < 21 or active bleeding, transfuse w/ Lasix when
   necessary
   -p.m. hct
   # ETOH abuse: No evidence of withdrawal
   - thiamine, folate, MVI daily
   # DM: Insulin sliding scale.
   # FEN: when GI output decreasing can start tube feeds.
   # PPX: PPI, INR elevated- hct stable so will restart sc heparin
   # ACCESS: PIV

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of hep C and alcohol-related cirrhosis who presented from another hospital with acute hepatic failure. She has been in the ICU for several days and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure/ARDS. She is also experiencing shock, likely due to sepsis or hepatic failure, as evidenced by her low blood pressure and poor perfusion. The patient has multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including hepatic, renal, and respiratory failure. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's condition is unstable, with worsening hypotension and increased lactate levels indicating poor tissue perfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels suggest sepsis as a potential complication. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of hep C and alcohol-related cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy is a possibility. Symptoms may include confusion, altered mental status, and decreased level of consciousness.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest AKI. This could be caused by pre-renal azotemia due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or acute tub"
