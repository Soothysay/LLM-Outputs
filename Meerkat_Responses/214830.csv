","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, and a complicated pulmonary history. She recently underwent tracheocutaneous fistula repair and was decannulated, resulting in a fistula closure. The patient presented with worsening respiratory distress and was found to have MRSA pneumonia. She also has signs of aspiration, fluid in the right lower and middle lobes, atelectasis, and patchy consolidation. There are also findings suspicious for interstitial edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to cardiac issues such as CHF or MI, pulmonary embolism (PE) given recent hospitalization and immobility, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), COPD exacerbation, or airway obstruction from recent surgery and airway instrumentation. The plan includes steroids for COPD component, nebs, antibiotics for VAP, and a CTA to rule out PE.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient may have ARF, possibly caused by pre-renal factors due to infection or ATN/AIN from medications given during the last hospitalization. The plan includes discontinuing bactrim, holding diuresis, and re-evaluating renal dosing of antibiotics.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): There is no evidence of ischemia on the ECG. The plan includes continuing ASA and BB,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, and a complicated pulmonary history who presented with worsening respiratory distress. She has had a prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation and subsequent fistula closure. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics. She also has acute renal failure, possible chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease without evidence of ischemia, congestive heart failure with moderate volume overload, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, a history of bacteremia, depression/anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent decannulation and fistula closure increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on CPAP for much of the day/night increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which may be due to pre-renal causes in the setting of infection or intrinsic renal damage from medications.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's history of prolonged tracheostomy and recent complications may suggest underlying CKD.
5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and further evaluation is needed to assess for any evidence"

   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Extubated [**9-18**], d/c'ed
   home [**9-20**] on Bactrim DS presumptively for extended coverage of her MRSA
   pneumonia (despite having completed course of Vanc.) At ~1AM this
   morning she developed shortness of breath when she got up to go to the
   bathroom. No cough, fevers, chills. She went back to bed, slept for ~1
   hour on CPAP but awoke again with persistent shortness of breath and
   presented to the ER for further evaluation. Denies chest pain /
   pressure, orthopnea, PND. She feels that her volume overload is
   improving. She denies leg swelling or pain. Persistent cough productive
   of white sputum, no purulence noted. No wheezing or stridor.
   24 Hour Events: Was on Bipap overnight.  Received CTA here which was

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Attempts were made in
   MICU to take her off NIPPV but her FiO2 requirement shot up to 100%-
   now back down on minimal PAP. So far her CXR and ENT eval do not appear
   acutely worsened from several days ago prior to hospital d/c . Her
   recent worsening appears most consistent with a multifactorial
   etiology:  upper airway procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway
   edema, bronchospasm/COPD, recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the
   surgical site.  Suspect mucus plug as the etilogy
   1) ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate when compared to CT back
   in [**Month (only) 2605**] was present then.  Will complete a 8 day course of antibiotics.
   2) Cardiac: She has a h/o diastolic CHF, however, her current
   presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her
   primary issue. Would aim for I/O to be euvolumic.
   3) Renal: Creatinine 1.3. Follow in the setting of anticipate CTA.
   4) COPD / tracheobronchiomalacia: Would provide standing nebs,
   Albuterol / Atrovent q4hr and q2hr PRN.   Will hold steroids no evidenc
   of wheeze on exam, Guaifenesin and chest PT. NIPPV overnight and as
   needed during the day. Should she require intubation, would do it with
   fiberoptic guidance given her recent surgery.   Would also follow with
   repeat CT scan once clear to evaluate for resolution of findinds
   otherwise would consider bronchoscopy to evaluate for obstruction.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Speech and swallow evaluation for
   chronic aspiration.  Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolumic
   for now.
   6) Hosp: Access - pIV, code - full, proph - PPI and SCDs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. She has a complicated pulmonary history including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She presented with respiratory distress due to MRSA pneumonia and was successfully extubated. She was discharged home on Bactrim DS for extended coverage of MRSA pneumonia. However, she developed shortness of breath again and returned to the hospital. Upon admission, she was started on non-invasive ventilation and received CTA, which was negative. She has been experiencing cough productive of white sputum without purulence, no wheezing or stridor, and her volume overload is improving. She denies leg swelling or pain.

Medical Complications:
1) Infectious Disease: The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia and recent tracheal fistula repair. There are bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may indicate ongoing infection or mucus plug obstruction.
2) Cardiac: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure. However, her current presentation does not suggest a primary cardiac issue. The goal is to maintain euvolemia.
3) Renal: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.3. Close monitoring is recommended.
4) COPD/tracheobronchiomalacia: The patient has a history of COPD"

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Attempts were made in
   MICU to take her off NIPPV but her FiO2 requirement shot up to 100%-
   now back down on minimal PAP. So far her CXR and ENT eval do not appear
   acutely worsened from several days ago prior to hospital d/c . Her
   recent worsening appears most consistent with a multifactorial
   etiology:  upper airway procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway
   edema, bronchospasm/COPD, recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the
   surgical site.  Suspect mucus plug as the etiology
   1) ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate when compared to CT back
   in [**Month (only) 2605**] was present then.  Will complete a 8 day course of antibiotics.
   2) Cardiac: She has a h/o diastolic CHF, however, her current
   presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her
   primary issue. Would aim for I/O to be euvolumic.
   3) Renal: Creatinine 1.3. Follow in the setting of  CTA.
   4) COPD / tracheobronchiomalacia: Would provide standing nebs,
   Albuterol / Atrovent q4hr and q2hr PRN.   Will hold steroids no evidenc
   of wheeze on exam, Guaifenesin and chest PT. NIPPV overnight and as
   needed during the day. Should she require intubation, would do it with
   fiberoptic guidance given her recent surgery.   Would also follow with
   repeat CT scan once clear to evaluate for resolution of findings
   otherwise would consider bronchoscopy to evaluate for obstruction.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Speech and swallow evaluation for
   chronic aspiration.  Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolumic
   for now.
   6) Hosp: Access - pIV, code - full, proph - PPI and SCDs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), complicated pulmonary history including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She was hospitalized for MRSA pneumonia and was discharged home on Bactrim DS. The patient presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath, which has been persistent despite using CPAP. She denies chest pain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or leg swelling. She reports feeling that her volume overload is improving.

24-hour events include non-invasive ventilation (NIV) starts and stops, a CTA that was negative, and urine and blood cultures drawn. The patient has allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, and Percocet. Her last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Medical history and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the current presentation. Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device.

Physical examination reveals a chronically ill-appearing patient, mild accessory muscle use during breathing, clear oropharynx, soft heart sounds with no murmurs or gallops, and crackles in the right lower lobe. The patient is obese with positive"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and mucous plug vs recurrent PNA. The patient had previous admissions for pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema. She underwent a tracheocutaneous fistula take down, during which she developed MRSA PNA/bacteremia. The patient is allergic to heparin agents, Percocet (oral), and has a history of thrombocytopenia.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, initiation of non-invasive ventilation, sputum culture, fluoroscopy for barium and video swallow study, respiratory arrest, intubation, administration of chest PT, lasix, and morphine. The patient's condition deteriorated, with increased tachycardia, hypotension, and poor oxygenation. She required neosynephrine and increased PEEP to 12. Blood cultures were drawn, and nitroglycerin was held due to hypotension. The patient's ABG showed pH 6.98, lactate 6.6, and Ve 9.3 L/min. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values indicate potential electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies reveal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history, including previous pneumonia, tracheostomy, and fistula repair. She has been admitted multiple times for pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema. The patient presented in acute respiratory distress and was intubated. Her condition has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia, possible silent aspiration, and pulmonary edema. She has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and BiPAP. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has shown signs of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. MRSA Infection: The patient had a previous infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which may require ongoing antibiotic treatment.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and subsequent intubation indicate a potential complication of acute respiratory failure.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray suggests pulmonary edema, which can be caused by fluid overload or heart failure.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, potentially due to medication or infection.
6. Cardiovascular Events: The patient has a history of coronary artery"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history. She has been admitted multiple times for pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema. Her recent admission was for the removal of a tracheocutaneous fistula, and she developed postoperative MRSA pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. 

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent swallow study showed no overt aspiration but may be slight silent aspiration. This increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.

2. MRSA Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA infection, including postoperative MRSA pneumonia. There is a concern for possible ongoing MRSA bacteremia, especially since the patient has leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's respiratory distress could be due to ARF, possibly secondary to pneumonia or acute lung injury. 

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated lactate level and elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating possible pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis/interstitial nephritis from medications given during her last hospitalization.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments for her condition, including a total hip replacement, tracheostomy, pseudomonas pneumonia, and tracheomalacia. She has also received laser treatment for granulation tissue in the trachea and had tracheal decannulation. The patient's medical history includes multiple admissions for both pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's recent hospitalization was for the removal of a tracheocutaneous fistula and treatment of postoperative MRSA pneumonia. She was discharged home on September 20th and presented in acute respiratory distress on September 22nd despite using home BIPAP. The working differential diagnosis included mucous plug versus recurrent pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, hypotension, cardiac issues, congestive heart failure, acute renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a history of bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6 C (99.6 F), current temperature 36.6 C (97.9 F), heart rate 75 bpm (46-134 bpm), blood pressure 99/42 mmHg (58) and 70/32 mmHg (44-100 mmHg), respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute (12-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 100%."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of complicated pulmonary issues, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheostomy, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She presented with acute respiratory distress and was intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent MRSA pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced an acute event of respiratory failure requiring intubation. The etiology of the respiratory distress may be mucous plugging or bronchospasm in the setting of possible underlying tracheal stenosis/edema or granulation tissue in the area of prior tracheostomy.
2. Hypotension: The patient required neosynephrine overnight with an elevated lactate level of 6.6, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. No evidence of new infection or intraabdominal pathology was found.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): No evidence of ischemia on ECG, and cardiac enzymes checked overnight showed normal levels.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has pulmonary edema by CXR and a recent echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction with some focal wall motion abnormality.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has a history of infection"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, cough, and fever. He has a history of COPD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, he was hypotensive and tachycardic. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lung, with crackles and increased tactile fremitus. Chest X-ray showed right lower lobe consolidation.

The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation but later required intubation due to respiratory arrest. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Blood cultures were drawn, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. A CT scan of the chest revealed right middle and lower lobe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.

During his ICU stay, the patient's condition has been fluctuating. He has had episodes of hypotension and hypoxemia requiring increased support. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, and hyperglycemia. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 75 to 134 bpm, blood pressure between 99/42 and 156/84 mmHg, respiratory rate between 22 and 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 95%. His temperature has been within normal limits.

The patient has received various medications, including propofol,"

   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology
   1) ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate when compared to CT back
   in [**Month (only) 2605**] was present then.  Will complete a 8 day course of
   antibiotics.  On vanc/cipro/zosyn for VAP.
   2) Cardiac: She has a h/o diastolic CHF, however, her current
   presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her
   primary issue. Would aim for I/O to be euvolumic.  Trend cardiac
   enzymes given event overnight.
   3) Renal: Creatinine 1.2. Follow in the setting of  CTA.
   4) COPD / tracheobronchiomalacia: Acute event overnight appears to be
   due to a mucus plug, likely complicated by underlying airway
   pathology.  [**Month (only) 60**] have tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue at level
   of prior trach complicating the situation.  Will discuss with IP
   possibility of bronch today (cannot bronch through ETT given 6.5
   tube).  Continue nebs.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Speech and swallow evaluation for
   chronic aspiration.  Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolumic
   for now.
   6) Shock:  Requiring neosynephrine overnight with an elevated lactate.
   No evidence of intraabdominal pathology to explain the lactate.  Will

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and recent tracheal fistula repair due to MRSA pneumonia. She presented with respiratory distress and was intubated after experiencing respiratory arrest. Her condition has worsened overnight, with hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and hypotension requiring vasopressor support. The patient has a complex medical history including tracheobronchiomalacia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation and previous MRSA pneumonia, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient is being treated with antibiotics to prevent this complication.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and diastolic congestive heart failure. Her current presentation does not strongly suggest a CHF exacerbation, but cardiac enzymes are being trended due to the recent event.
3. Renal impairment: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal impairment. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
4. Airway complications: The patient's tracheobronchiomalacia and previous tracheal fistula repair increase the risk of airway obstruction and further complications.
5. Shock: The patient required vasopressor support overnight, indicating possible shock. An elevated lactate level suggests tissue hypoperfusion"

2. Tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue: The patient's tracheal pathology may complicate extubation and airway management.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): Although not the primary issue at present, the patient's cardiac history raises concerns about the possibility of CHF exacerbation.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated lactate levels indicate possible renal impairment, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Malnutrition: The patient requires enteral nutrition support due to her critical illness and inability to meet nutritional requirements orally.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT, necessitating prophylactic measures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a complicated pulmonary history. She presented with worsened respiratory distress, which led to acute respiratory failure on September 24th. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced an acute event of respiratory failure, likely due to mucous plugging or bronchospasm. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient had low blood pressure (MAP in the low 50s) overnight, which required the administration of phenylephrine. Elevated lactate levels suggested possible tissue hypoperfusion.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): No evidence of ischemia was found on the EKG. Cardiac enzymes checked overnight showed no evidence of acute coronary syndrome.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient had pulmonary edema on chest X-ray overnight. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed on September 12th showed preserved ejection fraction with some focal wall motion abnormality. The patient received two doses of intravenous lasix overnight and appears euvolemic.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who presented to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. Initial EKG showed no ischemic changes, but cardiac enzymes (troponin) were elevated, suggesting possible demand ischemia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

24-hour events:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. Troponin levels increased to 0.13, but EKG showed no ischemic changes. Cardiac enzymes are trending downwards. The patient's blood pressure was low, so a bolus of normal saline was given to increase pressure and urine output. The patient has allergies to heparin agents, Percocet (oral), and thrombocytopenia. He has been receiving antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). He is currently on phenylephrine and propofol infusions. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/52 mmHg to 126/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increased fluid intake and output balance. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH: 7.30, PaCO2: 46, HCO3-: 28.3, SaO2: 100%, ventilation (Ve): 9"

- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history, including prolonged postoperative intubation, pseudomonas pneumonia, tracheostomy with resultant supraglottic stenosis and tracheomalacia. She has undergone laser treatment for granulation tissue in the trachea and tracheal decannulation.
- The patient has been admitted multiple times for pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema. Her most recent admission was for the removal of a tracheocutaneous fistula, during which she developed postoperative MRSA pneumonia/bacteremia treated with vancomycin.
- She was discharged home on oral bactrim and presented with acute respiratory distress despite using BIPAP at home. The working differential diagnosis included mucous plug versus recurrent pneumonia. She received intravenous dexamethasone for airway swelling seen on laryngoscopy.
- On the previous day, the patient's troponin level increased to 0.13, and her CK level decreased to 60. An EKG showed no ischemic changes, suggesting demand ischemia in the setting of respiratory distress.
- Today, the patient's cardiac enzymes are trending downwards, with a troponin level of 0.08 and a CK level of 39.
- The patient's creatinine level is improving, so her vancomycin dose has been changed from q48 to q24.

   in the case there is need for bronch or visualization of airway by
   either IP or ENT.  Given patient
s history of multiple episodes of
   respiratory distress, worrisome that patient would have future episodes
   and would benefit for visualization and possible intervention.
   - follow up with final IP and ENT recommendations
   - if no bronch or airway visualization today, can likely extubate
   patient today

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and complicated pulmonary history. The patient recently underwent tracheostomy closure after prolonged tracheostomy and developed a complicated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient presented with worsened respiratory distress and was intubated due to acute respiratory failure. 

The patient's troponin levels increased to 0.13 but have since trended downwards. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no ischemic changes, suggesting that the troponin elevation may not be related to acute coronary syndrome. The patient also experienced hypotension, which was responsive to fluid administration, and the lactate levels decreased. 

The patient has preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), but there are focal wall motion abnormalities. The patient is euvolemic and has had no further episodes of net even overnight without additional diuretics. 

The patient's white blood cell count has decreased, indicating a possible improvement in infection. The patient is at risk for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection due to recent antibiotic use. 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, beta-blockers, statin, proton"

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug, likely complicated by underlying airway pathology.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue at level of prior
   trach complicating the situation.  Will discuss need for bronch or
   visualization of airway with both IP and ENT.  If neither want to scope
   her, can likely extubate today given how well she looks on current
   settings.
   - PSV 5/5, SBT
   - Has received 10 days of abx, sputum was non-purulent [**9-23**].  Will d/c
   abx and follow fever curve, WBC count.
   2) Shock:  Neo requirement decreased, appears related to propofol.
   Lactate normalized.
   -wean neo
   3) Elevated troponin:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.  No ECG changes.  Goal euvolemic.
   4) Renal: Creatinine 1.2. Follow in the setting of  CTA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 67-year-old female patient with a history of tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheostomy, and recent tracheal fistula repair admitted with respiratory failure.
- The patient's recent worsening appears to be multifactorial, including upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia.
- The acute event the other night was likely due to a mucus plug, possibly complicated by underlying airway pathology.
- The patient has received 10 days of antibiotics, and sputum was non-purulent on 9-23.
- The patient's troponin levels are elevated but resolving, likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension.
- The patient's creatinine level is 1.2, and renal function will be followed in the setting of CTA.
- The patient's blood sugar is well-controlled, and electrolytes need to be repleted as needed.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to a mucus plug, underlying airway pathology, or bronchospasm/COPD. There is a need for bronchoscopic visualization of the airway or potential extubation.
2. Shock: The patient's need for neoprene requirement decreased, and it appears related to propofol. Lact"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She was admitted with respiratory failure and has been in the ICU. The patient's recent worsening appears to be due to a multifactorial etiology, including upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia. The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has respiratory failure, shock, elevated troponin levels, renal issues, and feeding/electrolyte problems.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and previous tracheal fistula repair may increase the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or airway obstruction.
2. Shock: The patient's requirement for neo (likely referring to neosynthesis or other medication) has decreased, indicating improvement in shock. However, the underlying cause of the shock should be closely monitored and managed to prevent recurrence.
3. Cardiac issues: Elevated troponin levels suggest possible cardiac damage or ischemia. It is essential to monitor the patient's cardiac status and address any ongoing myocardial injury.
4. Renal issues: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She has a complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheostomy decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. The patient presented with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia.

The patient's recent worsening appears to be due to a combination of factors, including upper airway edema and bronchospasm/COPD, as well as recent MRSA pneumonia. There are no problems with the surgical site. The acute event the other night was likely caused by a mucus plug, potentially complicated by underlying airway pathology.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently stable on CPAP/PSV settings with spontaneous breaths. She may be able to be extubated today given her current condition. A discussion with the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) physician and ENT specialist regarding the need for bronchoscopy or visualization of the airway is necessary.
2. Shock: The patient's need for neo requirement has decreased, likely related to propofol. Her lactate levels have normalized. Weaning off neo is recommended.
3. Elevated troponin: The elevated troponin levels are likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension and are now resolving. There are no ECG changes"

   Assessment and Plan
   67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated pulmonary history with
   prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation and subsequent fistula
   closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA
   presented with worsened respiratory distress. Patient with acute event
   of respiratory failure overnight on [**9-24**] requiring intubation with plan
   for bronchoscopy to evaluate.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Acute respiratory failure:</I>Patient intubated after acute
   respiratory failure on AM of [**9-24**]. Likely [**2-22**] mucous plugging vs
   bronchospasm in setting of possible underlying tracheal stenosis/edema
   or granulation tissue in area of prior trach. Patient still intubated
   in the case there is need for bronch or visualization of airway by
   either IP or ENT.  Given patient
s history of multiple episodes of
   respiratory distress, worrisome that patient would have future episodes
   and would benefit for visualization and possible intervention.
   - follow up with final IP and ENT recommendations
   - if no bronch or airway visualization today, can likely extubate
   patient today
   - trial patient on pressure support with SBT
   - patient has received 10 days of broad spectrum abx for staph in
   sputum from prior BAL. CXR with no evidence of infiltrate, last BCx and
   sputum unremarkable. Discontinue antibiotics today and follow fever
   curve, white count
   - touch base with speech and swallow regarding recommendations for diet
   to decrease chance of aspiration
   - continue nebs and aggressive chest PT
   .
   <I>## Hypotension:</I>Lactate decreased, has been weaned down on neo
   but unable to completely wean off while intubated and on propofol.
   Patient
s BP is fluid responsive and has been stable over last 8 hours.
   A-line attempted but unable to place, no need for monitoring currently
   - wean down neo as tolerated
   .
   <I>## CAD:</I> Patient with some troponin elevation to peak of 0.13 in
   setting of acute respiratory distress from two nights prior. Most
   recent troponin trending down at 0.08 and EKG with no acute ischemic
   changes
   -continue ASA, BB. Hold ACEI as above
   .
   <I>## CHF:</I>Patient with pulmonary edema by CXR overnight. TTE
   recently done ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion
   abnormality. Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any
   additional diuretics
   -Will allow patient to autodiuresis, goal net even overnight
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   -Holding ACEI as above for ARF
   .
   <I>## ARF:</I>Ddx includes pre-renal in setting of possible infection
   vs ATN/AIN from meds given during last hospitalization and in setting
   of CTA on [**9-22**]. Cr stable at 1.2
   -hold on diuresis
   -hold lisinopril
   -renally dose abx
   -check urine lytes, eos
   .
   <I>## COPD:</I>Likely not etiology of acute respiratory distress
   overnight, patient without wheezing on exam
   -continue nebs
   .
   <I>## Depression/anxiety:</I>
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   <I>## Hyperlipidemia:</I>
   -Continue statin
   .
   <I>## Leukocytosis:<I>White count decreased overnight. Concerning for
   infection although with normal diff.  Possible sources include likely
   lungs and possibly bactermia. Pt also at risk for c. diff given recent
   antibiotic use.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a complicated pulmonary history including prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation and subsequent fistula closure.

The patient presented with worsened respiratory distress and required intubation due to acute respiratory failure overnight on September 24th. A bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate the cause of the respiratory failure, but no significant findings were observed.

The patient's current medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient had an acute event of respiratory failure that required intubation. The likely causes include mucous plugging, bronchospasm, tracheal stenosis/edema, or granulation tissue in the area of the prior tracheostomy. The patient is still intubated for further evaluation and possible intervention.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable and fluid responsive. She has been weaned down on neoroleptics but unable to completely wean off while intubated and on propofol. An arterial line was attempted but unable to place, as there is no need for monitoring currently. The plan is to wean down neo as tolerated.

3. CAD: The patient has some troponin elevation to a"

   Assessment and Plan
   In Summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and
   complicated pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent
   decannulation and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**]
   on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory
   distress.  Now s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper
   airway stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Copmleted 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Anxiety also contributes to patient
s respiratory
   distress. Bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper airway
   stenosis.  Will need permanent trach if extubation is unsuccessful
   today.
   - extubate today
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn
   - transition to PO meds if successfully extubated
   .
   2.       Hypotension.  Patient required pressors while on propofol for
   sedation. Will wean neo and extubate today.  Hopeful that patient will
   not require pressors when not on sedation.
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI tomorrow if hemodynamically stable
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable for 24 hours off pressors
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril in AM
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   8.  Hyperlipidemia:
   -Continue statin

   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug vs aspiration.  No airway pathology seen on rigid
   bronch which would limit extubation.
   - good RSBI this AM, comfortable on [**5-26**], so will proceed with
   extubation.
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   2) Hypotension:  Resolved.  off neo.  Likely related to propofol.
   3) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.  Goal euvolemic.  Restart
   antihypertensives in AM if stable today.
   4) ARF:  Resolved.  Creatinine improved.
   5) F/E/N: NPO, restart clear liquids tonight if she does well. Follow /
   replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolemic for now.

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug vs aspiration.  No airway pathology seen on rigid
   bronch which would limit extubation.
   - good RSBI this AM, comfortable on [**5-26**], so will proceed with
   extubation.
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   2) Hypotension:  Resolved.  off neo.  Likely related to propofol.
   3) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.  Goal euvolemic.  Restart
   antihypertensives in AM if stable today.
   4) ARF:  Resolved.  Creatinine improved.
   5) F/E/N: NPO, restart clear liquids tonight if she does well. Follow /
   replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolemic for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, complicated pulmonary history including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She is currently presenting with respiratory distress due to MRSA pneumonia. The recent worsening appears to be multifactorial, involving upper airway procedure-related edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia.

The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy, which was normal, but she became hypoxic after extubation in the operating room and had to be reintubated. She received Lasix for pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray. 

The patient has several allergies, including Heparin Agents, Thrombocytopenia, and Nausea/Vomiting. Her last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/73 mmHg to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 70 mg/dL and 205 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-inch tall female who was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. She has been extubated and is now on CPAP support. The patient experienced an episode of asymptomatic hypotension, which resolved without intervention. She has requested advancement of her diet and has expressed hunger.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding or bruising.
2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient is allergic to heparin agents and has been taking Percocet (which contains oxycodone and acetaminophen) for pain management. Both of these medications can cause nausea and vomiting as side effects.
3. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin) for an unknown infection. If the infection is not appropriately treated, there is a risk of complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1097 mL since 12 AM, indicating potential dehydration or fluid loss.
5. Respiratory issues: Although the patient is on CPAP support, her SpO2 levels are low at 93%. This indicates that she may still be experiencing respiratory difficulties and requires close"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and complicated pulmonary history including prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation and subsequent fistula closure. The patient presented with worsened respiratory distress, flash pulmonary edema, and concern for upper airway obstruction due to previous intubations/trach. She was intubated on 9/24 after an episode of flash pulmonary edema and completed a 10-day course for aspiration pneumonia on 9/25. Rigid bronchoscopy on 9/25 showed no significant upper airway stenosis. The patient was successfully extubated on 9/26. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient's history of complicated pulmonary history, prolonged tracheostomy, and recent decannulation may increase the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring is required, especially as the patient advances her diet with aspiration precautions.
2. Hypotension - The patient experienced asymptomatic hypotension overnight but resolved without intervention. Monitoring blood pressure and fluid boluses as needed is recommended.
3. CAD - The patient had a troponin leak in the setting of flash pulmonary edema/HTN. Troponins have trended down. Continuing ASA (aspirin), beta-blockers (BB),"

   Assessment and Plan
   In Summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and
   complicated pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent
   decannulation and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**]
   on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory
   distress.  Now s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper
   airway stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Copmleted 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Anxiety also contributes to patient
s respiratory
   distress. Bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper airway
   stenosis.  Will need permanent trach if extubation is unsuccessful
   today.
   - extubate today
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn
   - transition to PO meds if successfully extubated
   .
   2.       Hypotension.  Patient required pressors while on propofol for
   sedation. Will wean neo and extubate today.  Hopeful that patient will
   not require pressors when not on sedation.
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI tomorrow if hemodynamically stable
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable for 24 hours off pressors
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril in AM
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline

   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug vs aspiration.  No airway pathology seen on rigid
   bronch.
   - aspiration precautions
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   - standing inhalers
   - CPAP prn per home regimen
   - appreciate ENT & IP input
   2) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.
   - on home dose of lasix
   - hold anithypertensives given bp 80s/40s overnight
   3) F/E/N: Diet per speech/swallow recommendations.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She also has a complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and a recent tracheal fistula repair. The patient presented with respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be due to a mucus plug or aspiration. However, she has shown improvement after extubation yesterday.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient had MRSA pneumonia, and it is important to monitor for any signs of recurrence or worsening respiratory symptoms.
3. Aspiration: Given the patient's complicated pulmonary history and the initial concern of a mucus plug, there is a risk of aspiration leading to further respiratory complications.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and CABG, and her elevated troponin levels suggest a possible cardiac event. Close monitoring of her cardiovascular status is necessary.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 80s/40s, indicating potential hypotension. This could be related to her cardiac condition or other factors, and appropriate interventions should be taken to maintain stable blood pressure.

   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress.  Suspect mucus plug as
   the etiology +/- aspiration.  Now much improved, s/p extubation
   yesterday.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug with aspiration in RLL.  No airway pathology seen on
   rigid bronch.
   - aspiration precautions
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   - standing inhalers
   - CPAP prn per home regimen
   - appreciate ENT & IP input
   2) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.
   - on home dose of lasix
   - hold anithypertensives given bp 80s/40s overnight
   3) F/E/N: Diet per speech/swallow recommendations.
   4) Anxiety:  ativan prn (home regimen.)

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She also has a complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. The patient presented with respiratory failure due to suspected mucus plug aspiration in the right lower lobe (RLL). She was intubated and received invasive ventilation but has now been extubated. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, possibly due to hypotension, but are resolving. She has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and her blood pressure was in the 80s/40s range overnight, indicating possible hypotension. The patient is currently on home-dose Lasix and had antihypertensives held. Other findings include clear chest X-ray, negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) status, and normal white blood cell (WBC) count. The patient is also being provided with inhalers as per home regimen and is on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) as needed."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and complicated pulmonary history.
- The patient presented with worsened respiratory distress, flash pulmonary edema, and concern for upper airway obstruction due to previous intubations and tracheostomy.
- The patient was intubated on [**9-24**] and completed a 10-day course for aspiration pneumonia on [**9-25**].
- Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper airway stenosis.
- The patient was successfully extubated on [**2138-9-26**] and is now on a regular diet with aspiration precautions.
- The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/54 mmHg to 138/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP.
- The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 420,000/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 115 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and sodium/potassium levels within normal range.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, CAD, CHF, acute renal failure (ARF), COPD, depression/anxiety, and hyperlipidemia.
- The plan includes close monitoring of respiratory status, strict aspiration precautions with PO intake, continuation of nebulizers, home lasix for interstitial edema, ativan as needed for anxiety, and consideration of resuming ACEI when blood pressure stabilizes and renal function improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and recent episodes of respiratory distress. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to her advanced age, underlying lung disease, and potential aspiration risk.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite being off pressors. This may indicate ongoing hypotension, which could be related to cardiac function or fluid balance.
3. CAD: The patient had a troponin leak during an episode of flash pulmonary edema/HTN, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF and recent episodes of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring for signs of fluid overload and continued use of diuretics are needed to manage this condition.
5. ARF: The patient had pre"

   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and complications from a prolonged tracheostomy. She presented with worsened respiratory distress and was found to have MRSA pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed no significant upper airway stenosis. She was intubated after experiencing flash pulmonary edema and concern for upper airway obstruction. The patient successfully completed a 10-day course for aspiration pneumonia and was extubated on 9/26 without any episodes of respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD, prolonged tracheostomy, and recent decannulation increases the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and respiratory support may be required.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure overnight, indicating the possibility of hypotension. Fluid boluses may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and CHF. The troponin leak during flash pulmonary edema suggests possible cardiac damage. Monitoring cardiac function and continuing antiplatelet and beta-blocker therapy is important.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient had an episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation and showed signs of interstitial edema on chest X-ray. Continuing"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated
   pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation
   and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with
   complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory distress.  Now
   s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper airway
   stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.
   - IP and ENT following, appreciate recs
   - strict aspiration precautions with PO intake
 regular food with thin
   liquids with aspiration precautions, but pills must be taken with
   thickened liquids
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn for anxiety
   .
   2.Hypotension. resolved.
   - monitor BP
   -will need to add back ace I in next 1-2 days
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI when BP tolerates and if renal function
   continues to improve
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril when BP tolerates, Cr improved
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate. Can change Ativan from
   IV to PO
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She also has a complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. The patient presented with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia. 

The patient's recent events include improvement in respiratory status, tolerating regular diet, and extubation on 09/26. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 to 138/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. 

The patient's lab results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. However, her troponin T levels were elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. 

The assessment and plan for the patient include the following:
1) Respiratory failure: The acute event that occurred the other night is believed to be due to a mucus plug with aspiration in the right lower lobe. The patient is now much improved after extubation on 09/26. She should continue with aspiration precautions, no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics, and use inhalers/nebs as per home regimen.

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress.  Suspect mucus plug as
   the etiology +/- aspiration.  Now much improved, s/p extubation [**9-26**].
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug with aspiration in RLL.  No airway pathology seen on
   rigid bronch.
   - aspiration precautions
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   - standing inhalers/nebs
   - CPAP prn per home regimen
   - appreciate ENT & IP input
   2) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.
   - on home dose of lasix
   - bp stable off antihypertensives
   3) F/E/N: Diet per speech/swallow recommendations.
   4) Anxiety:  ativan prn (home regimen.)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She has a complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She presented with respiratory distress due to suspected mucus plug and aspiration, but has since improved after extubation on 09/26.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced an acute respiratory event, likely caused by a mucus plug with aspiration in the right lower lobe (RLL). She has shown improvement since then. To prevent further respiratory issues, she should continue with aspiration precautions, no evidence of pneumonia, discontinuation of antibiotics, inhalers/nebs as prescribed, CPAP as needed following her home regimen, and appreciate input from ENT and IP services.

2. Elevated troponin and history of congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient had elevated troponin levels, which are now resolving. This could be due to a demand situation in the setting of hypotension. No ECG changes were observed. The patient should continue with home doses of lasix and maintain stable blood pressure off antihypertensives.

3. F/E/N: The patient should follow diet recommendations provided by speech/swallow specialists.

4. Anxiety: The patient can take ativan as needed, following her home regimen.
