","The patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include the placement of a central venous line (CVL), low central venous pressure (CVP), and low mixed venous oxygen saturation. The patient has been given broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofoxacin, cefepime, and flagyl, due to concerns of bacterial infection.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8Â°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 80/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, increased creatinine, and low glucose levels. Other lab results indicate abnormal liver function tests, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired peripheral vascular pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic status not assessed. The patient has impaired respiratory function with the need for supplemental oxygen and abnormal arterial blood gas values.

The patient's medical history includes impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y.o with hx ischemic cardiomyopathy, CRF, DM, PVD,
   tachy-brady syndrome who was admitted for bradycardia vs. syncope now
   here with leukocytosis, hypotension, and tachypnea likely due to sepsis
   and pulmonary edema.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient's source of infection is not clear.
   Possible etiologies include line sepsis, pneumonia, prostethic valve
   endocarditis, c. diff.  Patient had [**11-22**] blood cultures positive for
   MRSA on [**5-28**] with no clear source (?skin sound).  Additionally, had
   stenotrophomonas and klebsiella in his sputum at OSH.  Levoquin therapy
   for several weeks may have selected for a c. diff infection.
   - neo given significant tachycardia
   - vanco/zosyn/flagyl to cover broadly for bacterial infections and c.
   diff
   - follow mixed venous o2 sats with goal > 70
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - consider repeat TTE or TEE if source of fevers remain unclear
   tomorrow
   - consider abdomen imaging if clinically able to be transported
   - check glucan given prolonged
   .
   2.  Respiratory distress.  Patient developed respiratory distress in
   the setting of getting fluids.  Imaging and exam are consitent with
   fluid overload.  Vanco/zosyn will cover PNA, though this is less
   likely.
   - continue vanco/zosyn
   - consider bipap vs intubation if he has worsening respiratory status
   .
   3.  Low urine output
   .
   3.  Distended abdomen.  Patient has had emesis with meals.  KUB shows
   significant gastric distention consistent with gastric outlet
   obstruction.
   - NGT to suction
   - serial KUBs/ abdominal exams
   - will obtain CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast when able
   .
   4. Syncope/ ?Cardiac arrest. Circumstances of the ?cardiac arrest were
   unclear as there is little documentation of the event. Likely vagal
   event while on the bedpan associated with bradycardia. He was
   reportedly bradycardic during prior [**Hospital3 3928**] stay and was told
   he would need a pacemaker but at the time he had refused.  Cards now
   following but will not place pacemaker until after infectious clears.
   - monitor on tele
   - hold all AV nodal agents
   .
   5. Hypothyroid.
   - Levothyroxine home dose.
   .
   6. DM.  Had hypoglycemia previously.
   - reduce sliding scale for now given recent hypoglycemia
   - hold glyburide
   .
   7. CAD: S/p CABG.
   - hold aspirin given GIB 9coffee ground emesis)
   - continue statin
   .
   8. Gout.
   - continue allopurinol
   .
   9. afib:
   - hold coumadin given GIB
   .
   10. asthma.
   - cont inhalers/nebs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. These include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is experiencing leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), hypotension (low blood pressure), and tachypnea (rapid breathing), which are likely due to sepsis and pulmonary edema. The source of infection is not clear but could be line sepsis, pneumonia, prosthetic valve endocarditis, or Clostridium difficile infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover bacterial infections and C. diff.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient developed respiratory distress after receiving fluids, suggesting fluid overload. Imaging and examination are consistent with this diagnosis. The antibiotics already started will also cover possible pneumonia.

3. Low urine output: The patient has only produced 80 cc of urine overnight, indicating potential renal dysfunction or dehydration.

4. Distended abdomen: The patient has had emesis (vomiting) with meals, and imaging shows significant gastric distention consistent with gastric outlet obstruction. A nasogastric tube has been placed to suction, and further imaging studies may be required.

5. Syncope/possible cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a syncopal episode or cardiac arrest, which was likely a vagal event associated with bradycardia. The patient previously had bradycardia during a hospital stay and was advised to receive a pacemaker but declined. Cardiac monitoring has"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y.o with hx ischemic cardiomyopathy, CRF, DM, PVD,
   tachy-brady syndrome who was admitted for bradycardia vs. syncope now
   here septic shock and respiratory shock with no clear infectious
   source..
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient's source of infection is not clear.
   Possible etiologies include line sepsis, pneumonia, prostethic valve
   endocarditis, c. diff.  Patient had [**11-22**] blood cultures positive for
   MRSA on [**5-28**] with no clear source (?skin sound).  Additionally, had
   stenotrophomonas and klebsiella in his sputum at OSH.  Levoquin therapy
   for several weeks may have selected for a c. diff infection.  Also,
   gastric outlet obstruction noted on CXR is concerning for an abdominal
   infection.
   - ct torso to look for source of infection
   - currently on neo/vasopressin, will titrate neo if able & will add
   levophed if needed
   - levo/cefepime/flagyl to cover broadly for bacterial infections and c.
   diff
   - will switch vanco to linezolid given he has been on Vanco for several
   week and possibiltity of VRE
   - follow mixed venous o2 sats with goal > 70 (currently 88%)
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - consider repeat TTE or TEE if source of fevers remain unclear
   tomorrow
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure.  Patient developed respiratory distress in the
   setting of getting fluids.  Imaging and exam are consitent with fluid
   overload.  Vanco/cefepim will cover PNA, though this is less likely.
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - intubated today to permit for fluid rescitatino
   .
   3.       Low urine output.   Patient has had 80 cc urine overnight and
   creatinine is rising.  Likely atn in setting of hypotension.
   -  renal consult
   - follow cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   3.  Distended abdomen.  Patient has had emesis with meals.  KUB shows
   significant gastric distention consistent with gastric outlet
   obstruction which improved with NG suction.  No residuals this AM.
   - NGT to suction
   - serial KUBs/ abdominal exams
   - will obtain CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast when able
   .
   4. Syncope/ ?Cardiac arrest. Circumstances of the ?cardiac arrest were
   unclear as there is little documentation of the event. Likely vagal
   event while on the bedpan associated with bradycardia. He was
   reportedly bradycardic during prior [**Hospital3 3928**] stay and was told
   he would need a pacemaker but at the time he had refused.  Cards now
   following but will not place pacemaker until after infectious clears.
   - monitor on tele
   - hold all AV nodal agents

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and tachy-brady syndrome. He was admitted for bradycardia versus syncope but is now here for septic shock and respiratory shock with no clear infectious source. The patient has positive blood cultures for MRSA, stenotrophomonas, and klebsiella. He also has a gastric outlet obstruction on CXR, which is concerning for an abdominal infection. 

The patient's current medications include neo/vasopressin, levo/cefepime/flagyl, and linezolid. He is intubated to permit fluid resuscitation, and his mixed venous O2 sats are being monitored with a goal of >70. Sputum, blood, and urine cultures have been ordered, and a repeat TTE or TEE may be considered if the source of fevers remains unclear tomorrow. 

The patient has developed respiratory failure in the setting of getting fluids, with imaging and exam consistent with fluid overload. He is also experiencing low urine output, likely due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypotension. Renal consult has been requested, and the patient's creatinine is rising. 

Additionally, the patient has a distended abdomen with emesis and significant gastric distention consistent with gastric outlet obstruction, which improved with NG"

Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover bacterial infections, including C. diff.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient developed respiratory distress after receiving fluids, indicating possible fluid overload. Imaging and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Antibiotics have been continued to cover for pneumonia.

3. Low urine output: The patient has had low urine output overnight, and the creatinine level is rising. This suggests acute kidney injury, likely due to hypotension. A renal consult has been requested, and medications are being dosed based on renal function.

4. Distended abdomen: The patient has a distended abdomen with gastric outlet obstruction noted on the chest X-ray. This has improved with nasogastric suction. A trial of clamping the NG tube and checking for residuals will be done, and a CT torso is planned to investigate further.

5. Syncope/possible cardiac arrest: The circumstances of the cardiac arrest were unclear, but it may have been a vagal event associated with bradycardia. The patient has a history of bradycardia and previously refused a pacemaker. Cardiology is monitoring the patient, and a pac"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y.o with hx ischemic cardiomyopathy, CRF, DM, PVD,
   tachy-brady syndrome who was admitted for bradycardia vs. syncope now
   here septic shock and respiratory shock with no clear infectious
   source..
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient's source of infection is not clear.
   Possible etiologies include line sepsis, pneumonia, prostethic valve
   endocarditis, c. diff.  Patient had [**11-22**] blood cultures positive for
   MRSA on [**5-28**] with no clear source (?skin sound).  Additionally, had
   stenotrophomonas and klebsiella in his sputum at OSH.  Levoquin therapy
   for several weeks may have selected for a c. diff infection.  Also,
   gastric outlet obstruction noted on CXR is concerning for an abdominal
   infection.
   - ct torso to look for source of infection
   - currently on neo/vasopressin, will titrate neo if able & will add
   levophed if needed
   - levo/cefepime/flagyl to cover broadly for bacterial infections and c.
   diff
   - will switch vanco to linezolid given he has been on Vanco for several
   week and possibiltity of VRE
   - follow mixed venous o2 sats with goal > 70 (currently 88%)
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - consider repeat TTE or TEE if source of fevers remain unclear
   tomorrow
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure.  Patient developed respiratory distress in the
   setting of getting fluids.  Imaging and exam are consitent with fluid
   overload.  Vanco/cefepim will cover PNA, though this is less likely.
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - intubated today to permit for fluid rescitatino
   .
   3.       Low urine output.   Patient has had 80 cc urine overnight and
   creatinine is rising.  Likely atn in setting of hypotension.
   -  renal consult
   - follow cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   3.  Distended abdomen.  Patient has had emesis with meals.  KUB shows
   significant gastric distention consistent with gastric outlet
   obstruction which improved with NG suction.  No residuals this AM.
   - trial of clamping NG tube and checking residuals in [**12-23**] hours
   - ct torso today
   .
   4. Syncope/ ?Cardiac arrest. Circumstances of the ?cardiac arrest were
   unclear as there is little documentation of the event. Likely vagal
   event while on the bedpan associated with bradycardia. He was
   reportedly bradycardic during prior [**Hospital3 3928**] stay and was told
   he would need a pacemaker but at the time he had refused.  Cards now
   following but will not place pacemaker until after infectious clears.
   - monitor on tele

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, tachy-brady syndrome. He was admitted for bradycardia versus syncope and is now presenting with septic shock and respiratory shock. The source of infection is unclear, with positive blood cultures for MRSA and presence of klebsiella in sputum. He has gastric outlet obstruction noted on CXR, which is concerning for an abdominal infection. The patient is currently on neo/vasopressin, will titrate neo if able, and will add levophed if needed. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (levo/cefepime/flagyl) have been started to cover bacterial infections and C. diff. Vancomycin has been switched to linezolid due to the possibility of VRE.

The patient developed respiratory distress in the setting of getting fluids, imaging and exam consistent with fluid overload. He has been intubated to permit fluid resuscitation. The patient has had low urine output, likely acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypotension. A renal consult has been requested, and medications will be renally dosed. The patient also has a distended abdomen, with emesis and gastric outlet obstruction seen on imaging. A trial of clamping the NG tube and checking residuals is planned. A CT torso has been ordered.

   79 yo male with [**Last Name (un) **] CM, tachy-brady syndrome, PVD, afib. Recent
   evolution of leukocytosis and fevers with clinical picture suggestive
   of sepsis with multi organ failure (shock, respiratory distress,
   oliguria). Despite broad spectrum antibiotics and volume resuscitation,
   overall status has continued to decline.
   1. Acute respiratory distress related to sepsis and pulmonary edema
   - NIPPV started overnight for increased work of breathing
   - With ongoing septic picture, need for aggressive resuscitation and
   procedures- will move to intubation
   2. Sepsis-
   - Still with SIRS physiology on broad spectrum abx. Various potential
   sources (PNA, recent line, prosth. Valve endocarditis) but with lack of
   improvement despite broad spectrum abx and severity of sepsis,
   concerned over an abdominal process
   - On vanc/Cef/Levaquin/flagyl- dose Vanc by levels
   - F/u Blood and urine cultures
   - CT Torso after intubation
   - Neo and vasopressin to maintain MAP>65
   - check cortisol level
   3. Acute renal failure-
   - Despite fluid resuscitation, oliguric overnight with rising
   creatinine likely from sepsis/ATN
   - Continue to trend renal function, monitor electrolytes closely
   - Will likely need renal consult
   4. Abdominal distension-
   -KUB yesterday read as possible GOO, improved radiographic appearance
   after NG decompression
   - Will further evaluate on abdominal CT

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the hospital previously for altered mental status and had MRSA bacteremia with an unclear source. This time, he was admitted for syncope, possibly due to bradycardia or vasovagal episode. 

Yesterday, on the medical floor, the patient showed signs of sepsis, including leukocytosis, hypotension, and hypoxia, which prompted his transfer to the MICU. Upon admission, his mixed venous oxygen saturation was low, and central venous pressure (CVP) was initially 3 mmHg but improved after fluid resuscitation.

The patient's current condition is critical. He is receiving multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure, and his urine output has been marginal. Due to the severity of his condition, a CT scan is too risky at this time.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 71/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels. Blood cultures have been obtained, and he is on broad"

   79 yo male with [**Last Name (un) **] CM, tachy-brady syndrome, PVD, afib admitted with
   unresponsiveness at rehab thought secondary to vasovagal vs bradycardic
   event. Recent evolution of leukocytosis and fevers with clinical
   picture suggestive of sepsis with multi organ failure (shock,
   respiratory distress, oliguria). Despite broad spectrum antibiotics and
   volume resuscitation, his overall status has continued to decline.
   1. Acute respiratory failure related to sepsis and pulmonary edema
   - NIPPV started overnight for increased work of breathing
   - With ongoing septic picture, need for aggressive resuscitation and
   procedures- will move to intubation
   2. Sepsis-/shock
   - Still with SIRS physiology; on broad spectrum abx. Various potential
   sources (PNA, recent line, prosth. Valve endocarditis) but with lack of
   improvement despite broad spectrum abx, no organism recovery from
   cultures, and severity of sepsis, concerned over about an abdominal
   process
   - On vanc/Cef/Levaquin/flagyl- dose Vanc by levels
   - F/u Blood and urine cultures
   - CT Torso after intubation
   - Neo and vasopressin to maintain MAP>65
   - check cortisol level
   3. Acute renal failure-
   - Despite fluid resuscitation, oliguric overnight with rising
   creatinine likely from sepsis/ATN
   - Continue to trend renal function, monitor electrolytes closely
   - Anticipate he will need renal consult
   4. Abdominal distension-
   -KUB yesterday read as possible GOO, improved radiographic appearance
   after NG decompression
   - Will further evaluate on abdominal CT
   5. Tachy-brady syndrome- no active intervention given pt's more acute
   issues

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted for bradycardia versus syncope. The patient is currently in septic shock and respiratory failure without a clear infectious source. The family has made the decision for do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) with no escalation of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerous changes in blood pressure and organ function.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate gas exchange and oxygenation. This can be due to several factors such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to immobility, pressure ulcers, or compromised vascular supply.
4. Bacteremia: The patient may have bacteremia, which is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. It can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib, a common cardiac arrhythmia characterized by irregular and often rapid heart rate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and altered mental status. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and aortic valve replacement. He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to have septic shock, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's blood cultures showed bacteremia, and he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. He experienced a cardiac arrest and required advanced cardiac life support measures. The patient's condition has been unstable, and he has not been able to be weaned off the ventilator. He is currently on vasopressin and norepinephrine for hemodynamic support.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to the underlying lung condition or complications from the ventilator.

2. Septic Shock: The patient is already in septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood pressure, and urine output is necessary to detect any further deterioration.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection. Regular repositioning and proper skin care are essential to prevent complications.

4. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteremia"

   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y.o with hx ischemic cardiomyopathy, CRF, DM, PVD,
   tachy-brady syndrome who was admitted for bradycardia vs. syncope now
   here septic shock and respiratory shock with no clear infectious
   source..
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient's source of infection is not clear.
   Possible etiologies include line sepsis, pneumonia, prostethic valve
   endocarditis, c. diff.  Patient had [**11-22**] blood cultures positive for
   MRSA on [**5-28**] with no clear source (?skin sound).  Additionally, had
   stenotrophomonas and klebsiella in his sputum at OSH.  Levoquin therapy
   for several weeks may have selected for a c. diff infection.  Also,
   gastric outlet obstruction noted on CXR is concerning for an abdominal
   infection.
   - ct torso to look for source of infection
   - currently on neo/vasopressin, will titrate neo if able & will add
   levophed if needed
   - levo/cefepime/flagyl to cover broadly for bacterial infections and c.
   diff
   - will switch vanco to linezolid given he has been on Vanco for several
   week and possibiltity of VRE
   - follow mixed venous o2 sats with goal > 70 (currently 88%)
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - consider repeat TTE or TEE if source of fevers remain unclear
   tomorrow
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure.  Patient developed respiratory distress in the
   setting of getting fluids.  Imaging and exam are consitent with fluid
   overload.  Vanco/cefepim will cover PNA, though this is less likely.
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - intubated today to permit for fluid rescitatino
   .
   3.Low urine output.   Patient has had 80 cc urine overnight and
   creatinine is rising.  Likely atn in setting of hypotension.
   -  renal consult
   - follow cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   4.  Distended abdomen.  Patient has had emesis with meals.  KUB shows
   significant gastric distention consistent with gastric outlet
   obstruction which improved with NG suction.  No residuals this AM.
   - trial of clamping NG tube and checking residuals in [**12-23**] hours
   - ct torso today
   .
   5. Syncope/ ?Cardiac arrest. Circumstances of the ?cardiac arrest were
   unclear as there is little documentation of the event. Likely vagal
   event while on the bedpan associated with bradycardia. He was
   reportedly bradycardic during prior [**Hospital3 3928**] stay and was told
   he would need a pacemaker but at the time he had refused.  Cards now
   following but will not place pacemaker until after infectious clears.
   - monitor on tele
   - hold all AV nodal agents
   .
   6. Hypothyroid.
   - Levothyroxine home dose.
   .
   7. DM.  Has hypoglycemic.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, tachy-brady syndrome, and previous cardiac arrest. The patient was admitted for bradycardia versus syncope and is now experiencing septic shock and respiratory shock with an unclear infectious source.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's source of infection is not clear, and possible etiologies include line sepsis, pneumonia, prosthetic valve endocarditis, or Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has had blood cultures positive for MRSA and stenotrophomonas and klebsiella in his sputum. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover bacterial infections and C. diff.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient developed respiratory distress after receiving fluids, which is consistent with fluid overload. Imaging and exam findings support this diagnosis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued to cover pneumonia.

3. Low urine output: The patient has had low urine output overnight, and creatinine levels are rising. This suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. Renal consultation has been requested, and medications will be dosed accordingly.

4. Distended abdomen: The patient has had emesis with meals, and imaging shows significant gastric distention consistent with gastric outlet obstruction. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo male with [**Last Name (un) **] CM, tachy-brady syndrome, PVD, afib admitted with
   unresponsiveness at rehab thought secondary to vasovagal vs bradycardic
   event. Recent evolution of leukocytosis and fevers with clinical
   picture suggestive of sepsis with multi organ failure (shock,
   respiratory distress, oliguria). Despite broad spectrum antibiotics and
   volume resuscitation, his overall status has continued to decline. PEA
   arrest overnight, with goals of care shifting toward CMO. PEA arrest
   possibly due to ischemia, ? thromboembolic disease. Underying very sick
   cardiac substrate and severe sepsis w/ shock.
   Goals of care- following PEA arrest, change in goals -->  to DNR and
   probable CMO when family arrives
   -for now continue pressor support

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of chronic myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted to the rehabilitation center for unresponsiveness but was later transferred to the ICU due to suspected sepsis with multi-organ failure. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, his condition has continued to deteriorate. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest overnight and his goals of care have been changed to comfort measures only (CMO) after discussion with the family. He remains on pressor support and continues to be monitored for hemodynamics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with multi-organ failure: The patient's clinical picture suggests sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection. If not managed promptly and effectively, it can lead to multi-organ failure.

2. Cardiac ischemia/thromboembolic disease: The PEA arrest may be due to ischemia or a thromboembolic event, possibly related to the underlying severe cardiac substrate. This could result in further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient is receiving ventilatory support due to respiratory distress. Improper management of ventilation settings or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of complications.

4. Hemodynamic instability: The"
