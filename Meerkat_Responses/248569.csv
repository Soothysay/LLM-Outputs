   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia.
   .
   # Sepsis: febrile, hypotensive, hypoxic.  Source is likely urine given
   pyuria.  She received vanc/zosyn in the ED.  Also a nursing home
   patient, so resistant organisms are possible.  UCx pending.  BCx's
   pending.  No obvious infiltrates by CXR.
   - vanc/zosyn
   - f/u cultures, tailor antibiotics accordingly
   - Goal to wean pressors.  She may live with low SBP and could be
   permitted to have slightly low pressures if her end organ function is
   adequate (i.e. her urine output is sufficient).
   - fluid with CVP goal [**8-15**]
   - surveillance cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  No medical history of
   [**Known lastname **] disease, though albuterol and ipratropium is on her med list
   baseline CO2 elevated, likely kyphoscoliosis.  Family denies any
   smoking history.  Other etiology could be aspiration given AMS,
   hypoventilation 2/2 AMS, ARDS from sepsis.  CXR not currently
   consistent with any of these.
   - Ventilation with VAP precautions, wean to pressure support, SBT and
   RSBI, with the goal of extubation as soon as possible.
   - Follow ABG, and clinical setting.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Concern for rapid
   normalization and resulting cerebral edema.  Central diabetes insipidus
   also a possibility.  Free water deficit 4.7L.
   - LR volume repletion
   - 300 cc q3 free water through OG
   - Follow Na with q 4hr chemistries.
   - Urine lytes
   - would like to avoid overcorrecting or correcting too quickly, though
   volume status in setting of septic picture takes precedence.
   - consider head imaging
   .
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status.
   - Consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   - Spoke with cardiology who recommended that we consult EP for further
   evaluation of possible high degree heart block.
   .
   # ARF: likely [**2-4**] to volume depletion
 rapidly correcting in 12 hours.
   - Renal dose meds
   - Volume replete
   - Urine lytes

   # Paroxysmal afib:
   - confirm not an anticoagulation candidate

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-inch tall and 49.5 kg male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving dopamine infusions. The patient's sodium levels are trending down, and there is a concern for potential heart block as evidenced by episodes of bradycardia and an abnormal EKG. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 73%. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 107/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 8,093 mL and a total output of 1,130 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 6,963 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including dopamine, famotidine, and heparin. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.4 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin with a Hct of 39.9%, elevated platelet count with a Plt of 180,000/mm^3, and elevated creatinine with a Cr of 2.1. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range at 0."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient is febrile, hypotensive, and hypoxic, suggesting sepsis. The source of infection is likely the urinary tract given the presence of pyuria. The patient has already received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the emergency department. Cultures are pending, and antibiotic therapy will be tailored accordingly. Central venous access and arterial line have been placed, and pressors are being administered to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and ensure adequate urine output. Fluid resuscitation with careful monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) between 10-18 is also being performed. Surveillance cultures will be obtained.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia and hypercarbia, indicating respiratory failure. There is no known history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although albuterol and ipratropium are on her medication list. Possible causes of respiratory failure include aspiration pneumonia due to altered mental status, hypoventilation secondary to altered mental"

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient is currently in the ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis physiology, indicating a systemic inflammatory response to infection. The source of infection is likely urinary given the presence of pyuria. The patient has already received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the emergency department. Cultures are pending, and antibiotics will be tailored accordingly.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia and hypercarbia. There is no medical history of known respiratory disease, although albuterol and ipratropium are on her medication list. The family denies any smoking history. Other etiologies could be aspiration given AMS, hypoventilation due to AMS, or ARDS from sepsis. The chest X-ray does not currently show any signs of these conditions.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a significantly elevated sodium level, likely due to extreme dehydration. There is concern for rapid normalization and resulting cerebral edema. Central diabetes insipidus is also a possibility. A free water deficit of 4.7 L is present.

   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Source is likely
   urine given pyuria, though may have something in her [**Known lastname **] as well.  She
   received vanc/zosyn in the ED.  Also a nursing home patient, so
   resistant organisms are possible.  UCx,  BCx's, an sputum Cx pending.
   Patient appears to be improving clinically this morning.
   - cont. vanc/zosyn for now.
   - f/u cultures, tailor antibiotics accordingly
   - Goal to wean pressors.  She may live with low SBP and could be
   permitted to have slightly low pressures if her end organ function is
   adequate (i.e. her urine output is sufficient).
   - fluid with CVP goal [**8-15**]
   - surveillance cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  No medical history of
   [**Known lastname **] disease, though albuterol and ipratropium is on her med list
   baseline CO2 elevated, likely kyphoscoliosis.  Family denies any
   smoking history.  Other etiology could be aspiration given AMS,
   hypoventilation 2/2 AMS, ARDS from sepsis.  CXR not currently
   consistent with any of these.
   - Ventilation with VAP precautions, wean to pressure support, SBT and
   RSBI, with the goal of extubation as soon as possible.
   - Follow ABG, and clinical setting.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Concern for rapid
   normalization and resulting cerebral edema.  Central diabetes insipidus
   also a possibility.  Free water deficit 4.7L.
   - LR volume repletion
   - 300 cc q3 free water through OG
   - Follow Na with q 4hr chemistries.
   - Urine lytes
   - would like to avoid overcorrecting or correcting too quickly, though
   volume status in setting of septic picture takes precedence.
   - consider head imaging
   .
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status.
   - Consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   - Spoke with cardiology who recommended that we consult EP for further
   evaluation of possible high degree heart block.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.
- The source of sepsis is likely from the urine given pyuria, although there may be something else in her [**known lastname**] as well.
- The patient received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the emergency department.
- She has been improving clinically since this morning.
- Current goals include continuing antibiotics, tailoring antibiotics based on culture results, weaning off pressors, maintaining a CVP goal of [**8-15**], and surveillance cultures.
- The patient also has respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia, possibly due to kyphoscoliosis or aspiration.
- Ventilation with VAP precautions is being implemented, along with the goal of extubation as soon as possible.
- The patient has hypernatremia likely from extreme dehydration, and there is concern for rapid normalization and resulting cerebral edema.
- LR volume repletion, free water administration, and close monitoring of sodium levels are being done to avoid overcorrecting or correcting too quickly.
- AMS is likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, although other etiologies could include stroke and underlying dementia.
- Bradycardia is present, and an evaluation for possible high-degree heart block is recommended.
- Acute renal failure is likely secondary to volume depletion and may rapidly correct in 12 hours.
- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is also present, and the patient is not an anticoagulation candidate.
- The patient has Alzheimer's disease and will continue with home medications.
- Prophylactic measures include H2 blocker, subcutaneous heparin, and bowel regimen.
- Code status is full code, and disposition is ICU level care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis physiology indicates a serious infection that can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and hypercarbia suggest inadequate respiratory function, which can progress to respiratory arrest if not appropriately managed.
3. Hypernatremia: Rapid normalization of sodium levels can result in cerebral edema, potentially leading to neurological complications.
4. AMS: Without improvement towards baseline mental status, the patient may develop further complications related to altered mental function.
5. Bradycardia: A high-degree heart block could progress to complete heart block, resulting in decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
6. ARF: Rapid correction of renal failure can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of renal injury.
7. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Without appropriate management, this arrhythmia can lead to thromboembolic events or cardiac complications.
8. VAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia can develop if appropriate VAP precautions are not followed.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with AMS (altered mental status), fever, hypotension, and hypoxia suggests sepsis. The source of infection is likely the urinary tract, given the presence of pyuria. However, there may also be an infection in the [**Known Last Name**] as well. Antibiotics have been started empirically, and further cultures are pending to tailor the antibiotic therapy accordingly.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing hypoxia and hypercarbia, indicating respiratory failure. This could be due to several factors, including aspiration, hypoventilation related to AMS, or ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to sepsis. The baseline CO2 elevation suggests kyphoscoliosis as a possible underlying cause. Ventilation with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) precautions and weaning to pressure support are recommended to prepare for extubation.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had profound hypernatremia (170) which responded to free water administration. It is important to avoid overcorrection of sodium levels by reducing free water through the NGT (nasogastric tube). Head imaging may be considered if there is no improvement towards baseline mental status.

4. AMS (altered mental status): The patient is likely experiencing toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, but other"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The source of sepsis is likely the urine given pyuria, although there may also be involvement in her lungs. She received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the emergency department. The patient appears to be improving clinically and is no longer requiring pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia, indicating sepsis. The source of sepsis is suspected to be a urinary tract infection, but there may also be involvement in her lungs. Continuous monitoring and management of sepsis are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxia and hypercarbia, indicating respiratory failure. This may be due to underlying kyphoscoliosis or aspiration secondary to altered mental status. Ventilation with VAP precautions should be continued, and efforts to wean the patient off the ventilator should be made.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient had severe dehydration leading to hypernatremia. Now that it has resolved, care should be taken to avoid overcorrection by reducing free water through the nasogastric tube.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Source is likely
   urine given pyuria, though may have something in her [**Known lastname **] as well.  She
   initially received vanc/zosyn in the ED.  Also a nursing home patient,
   so resistant organisms are possible.  UCx grew out pan sensitive
   proteus mirabilis.  BCx's, an sputum Cx pending.  Patient appears to be
   improving clinically and is no longer requiring pressors.
   - Cont. vanc/unasyn for now to cover proteus and Gm+ Cocci in her
   sputum that haven
t yet speciated.
   - Draw a Vanc level today and redose her based upon recovering renal
   function tomorrow.
   - F/u cultures, tailor antibiotics accordingly
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 60, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  No medical history of
   [**Known lastname **] disease, though albuterol and ipratropium are on her med list.
   Baseline CO2 elevated, likely kyphoscoliosis.  Family denies any
   smoking history.  Other etiology could be aspiration given AMS,
   hypoventilation 2/2 AMS, ARDS from sepsis.  CXR shows more RLL opacity
   this morning, though could in part be related to fluid resuscitation.
   - Ventilation with VAP precautions, wean to pressure support, SBT and
   RSBI, with the goal of extubation as soon as possible, possibly today.
   - Follow ABG, and clinical setting.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - Reduce free water through NGT to avoid over correcting
   - consider head imaging
   .
   # ?Coagulopathy:  PTT is elevated on two subsequent draws without
   obvious medical cause.
   - Placed on standing Vit K
   - Will follow and trend coags.
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient is extubated once again.  During the interval time between
   extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the family
   to be near baseline.
   - Consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   - Spoke with cardiology who recommended that we consult EP for further
   evaluation of possible high degree heart block.  Initially they
   commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal or tied to her
   underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis and
   re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   - Due to her episodes of hypotension overnight, will touch base with EP
   once again today.
   .
   # ARF: Likely [**2-4**] to volume depletion
 now resolved.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to re-dose medications based upon recovering renal
   function.  Will go over medications.
   - Volume replete as necessary.

   # Paroxysmal afib:
   - Confirm not an anticoagulation candidate
   .
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient initially had fever, hypotension, and hypoxia, indicating sepsis. The source of infection is likely from the urine, although there might be another source in her [known lastname] as well. She received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the emergency department. Cultures for urinary catheter (UCx), blood cultures (BCx), and sputum culture (Cx) are pending. The patient appears to be improving clinically and no longer requires pressors.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia, indicating sepsis. The source is likely the urine given pyuria, although another source in her [known lastname] could also be possible. She received appropriate antibiotics (vanc/zosyn) in the ED. Resistant organisms are possible due to her being a nursing home patient. UCx, BCx's, and sputum Cx are pending. The patient appears to be improving clinically and is no longer requiring pressors.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now.
   - Follow up cultures, tailor antibiotics accordingly.

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia and hypernatremia. She presented with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, urinary tract infection (UTI), and impressive hypernatremia. The source of sepsis is likely from the urine given pyuria, though there may be something in her sputum as well due to Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the sputum culture. She initially received vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) in the emergency department (ED). The urine culture grew pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia, indicating sepsis. The source of infection is likely from the urinary tract, but there may also be an infection in the respiratory system. Resistant organisms are possible due to her being a nursing home patient.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure characterized by hypoxia and hypercarbia. This could be due to various etiologies such as kyphoscoliosis, aspiration, hypoventilation secondary to altered mental status (AMS), or ARDS from sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49.5 kg, 60-inch male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute hypotension, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of no known drug allergies and is currently on tailored antibiotics for the proteus and GPC in the sputum. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.8 C (98.3 F), HR: 60 bpm, BP: 102/48 mmHg, RR: 16 inspiratory breaths per minute, SpO2: 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is first-degree AV block, and they are on dopamine for hypotension. The patient's weight is currently 60 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypokalemia (low potassium, hypotassium): The patient's potassium levels are low, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory muscle paralysis.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is on tailored antibiotics, but there is a risk of ongoing infection and potential progression to septic shock.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to various factors such as medication, infection, or other underlying conditions. This may increase the risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Source is likely
   urine given pyuria, though may have something in her [**Known lastname **] as well.  She
   initially received vanc/zosyn in the ED.  Also a nursing home patient,
   so resistant organisms are possible.  UCx grew out pan sensitive
   proteus mirabilis.  BCx's, an sputum Cx pending.  Patient appears to be
   improving clinically and is no longer requiring pressors.
   - Cont. vanc/unasyn for now to cover proteus and Gm+ Cocci in her
   sputum that haven
t yet speciated.
   - Draw a Vanc level today and redose her based upon recovering renal
   function tomorrow.
   - F/u cultures, tailor antibiotics accordingly
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 60, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  No medical history of
   [**Known lastname **] disease, though albuterol and ipratropium are on her med list.
   Baseline CO2 elevated, likely kyphoscoliosis.  Family denies any
   smoking history.  Other etiology could be aspiration given AMS,
   hypoventilation 2/2 AMS, ARDS from sepsis.  CXR shows more RLL opacity
   this morning, though could in part be related to fluid resuscitation.
   - Ventilation with VAP precautions, wean to pressure support, SBT and
   RSBI, with the goal of extubation as soon as possible, possibly today.
   - Follow ABG, and clinical setting.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - Reduce free water through NGT to avoid over correcting
   - consider head imaging
   .
   # ?Coagulopathy:  PTT is elevated on two subsequent draws without
   obvious medical cause.
   - Placed on standing Vit K
   - Will follow and trend coags.
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient is extubated once again.  During the interval time between
   extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the family
   to be near baseline.
   - Consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   - Spoke with cardiology who recommended that we consult EP for further
   evaluation of possible high degree heart block.  Initially they
   commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal or tied to her
   underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis and
   re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   - Due to her episodes of hypotension overnight, will touch base with EP
   once again today.
   .
   # ARF: Likely [**2-4**] to volume depletion
 now resolved.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to re-dose medications based upon recovering renal
   function.  Will go over medications.
   - Volume replete as necessary.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib:
   - Confirm not an anticoagulation candidate
   .
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: full code.  Discussed with patient
s son [**Name (NI) 6287**] who wants
everything done
 including reintubation if patient fails extubation.
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia and hypernatremia who presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, urinary tract infection (UTI), and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the emergency department.

The patient's current condition is improving clinically, and she is no longer requiring vasopressors. However, she still has bradycardia, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, acute mental status changes, acute renal failure, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. The source of infection appears to be urinary, but there may also be involvement in the respiratory system.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxia and hypercarbia, indicating difficulty in breathing. This could be due to underlying kyphoscoliosis, aspiration, hypoventilation caused by AMS, or ARDS from sepsis.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high level of sodium in her blood, which may be related to extreme dehydration. It is important to monitor and manage this condition to avoid complications such as cerebral edema.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female admit with sepsis and concerning severity of alteration of
   mental status now with metabolic derangements being addressed
   individually has moved towards baseline mental status.  Of note she has
   had intermittent bradycardia over past 24-48 hours with EP evaluation
   completed.
   1)Sepsis-
   Vanco/Unasyn/Flagyl
   -Likely Proteus from urinary source as possible initial insult
   -Continue with Vanco/Unasyn/Flagyl
   -IVF as needed
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -In CMV mode
   -Reasonable PIP/Pplat noted
   -Mental status may be a barrier to extubation but will have to
   re-evaluate as PSV wean is effected.
   -Hope to move to RSBI and extubation trial in am.
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -Improved Na+ levels noted
   4)Bradycardia-
   Atropine/Dopamine as needed
   No severe Bradycardia noted this am.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia
   (170_
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Source is likely
   urine given pyuria, though may have something in her [**Known lastname **] as well given
   GPCs in sputum.  She initially received vanc/zosyn in the ED.  Also a
   nursing home patient, so resistant organisms are possible.  UCx grew
   out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis.  BCx's, an sputum Cx pending.
   Patient appears to be improving clinically and is no longer requiring
   pressors.
   - Cont. vanc/unasyn for now to cover proteus and Gm+ Cocci in her
   sputum that haven
t yet speciated.
   - Draw a Vanc level today and redose her based upon recovering renal
   function tomorrow.
   - F/u cultures, tailor antibiotics accordingly
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 60, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  No medical history of
   [**Known lastname **] disease, though albuterol and ipratropium are on her med list.
   Baseline CO2 elevated, likely kyphoscoliosis.  Family denies any
   smoking history.  Other etiology could be aspiration given AMS,
   hypoventilation 2/2 AMS, ARDS from sepsis.  CXR shows more RLL opacity
   this morning, though could in part be related to fluid resuscitation.
   - Ventilation with VAP precautions, wean to pressure support, SBT and
   RSBI, aim to extubate today.  Patient is triggering on own, and mental
   status will never be excellent, given advanced dementia
   - Follow ABG, and clinical setting.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - Reduce free water through NGT to avoid over correcting
   - consider head imaging at any signs of increased intracranial pressure
   .
   # ?Coagulopathy:  PTT was elevated x2, but has responded well to
   vitamin K
   - Placed on standing Vit K
   - Will follow and trend coags.
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient is extubated once again.  During the interval time between
   extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the family
   to be near baseline.
   - Consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   .-Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # ARF: Likely [**2-4**] to volume depletion
 now resolved.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to re-dose medications based upon recovering renal
   function.  Will go over medications.
   - Volume replete as necessary.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib:
   - Confirm not an anticoagulation candidate
   .
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: full code.  Discussed with patient
s son [**Name (NI) 6287**] who wants
everything done
 including reintubation if patient fails extubation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient initially received vancomycin (Vanco) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) in the emergency department (ED) for suspected sepsis. Subsequently, she developed respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia, which required mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 115/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her C-reactive protein (CRP) level is elevated at 153 K/uL, leukocyte count is 6.9 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) is 31.7%, platelet count is 147 K/uL, and blood glucose is 133 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient initially had fever, hypotension, and hypoxia, and the source of infection is likely from the urine given pyuria. There may also be an infection in the sputum due to MRSA. The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. The source of infection is likely the urine, but there may also be an infection in the sputum. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any worsening of sepsis symptoms.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure characterized by hypoxia and hypercarbia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is concern for volume overload due to fluid resuscitation. The patient may also have pneumonia (PNA) and pleural effusions. Duiresis with Lasix is recommended, and the patient's response to the breathing trial will determine the next steps.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has resolved hypernatremia, which was likely caused by extreme dehydration. Free water"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female admitted with respiratory failure and now showing signs of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the sputum culture results. The patient was unable to tolerate spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to unfavorable respiratory system compliance and resistance index (RSBI).

The patient has a history of multiple antibiotic use, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn), Vancomycin, Metronidazole, and Ampicillin. Currently, the patient is receiving Vancomycin, Lasix (furosemide), Heparin sodium (prophylaxis), Fentanyl, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/48 to 132/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 320, and a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, dullness on percussion, and diminished breath sounds. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal first heart sound (S1) and a distant second heart sound (S2). The peripheral vascular examination does not assess the radial or digital pulses. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 153 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 132 mg/dL, and hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L. Imaging shows no significant change in infiltrate, but there is a suggestion of right-sided effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP due to GPC infection in the sputum culture. Antibiotics are being administered to treat the infection.

2. Hypokalemia (low potassium): The patient has a low potassium level, which may require correction.

3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has sepsis likely due to a urinary source with Proteus and possible GPC involvement in the sputum. Antibiotics are being continued, and follow-up cultures are planned.

4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient has an altered mental status, which is not classified as delirium.

5. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, but there is no evidence of shock.

6. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient has persistent ventilatory failure, likely due to increased pulmonary resistance"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.

Assessment and plan:
- Sepsis: The source of sepsis is likely from the urine given the presence of pyuria. There may also be an additional source in her sputum, as MRSA was found.
- Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxia and hypercarbia. She is volume overloaded due to fluid resuscitation, which may be contributing to the respiratory failure. There may be a possible pneumonia and pleural effusions. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday due to a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) above 130 and increasing acidosis.
- Hypernatremia: The hypernatremia is likely due to extreme dehydration, but it has now been resolved.
- Altered mental status (AMS): The cause of AMS could be toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, stroke, or underlying dementia. Once the patient is extubated, it will be important to speak with the family to outline her baseline mental status.
- Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia and an AV block.
- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female wtih admission with urosepsis complicated by shock and
   respiratory failure now with slow to resolve respiratory failure.  She
   had worsening hypercarbia with SBT and unfavorable RSBI all concerning
   for persistent ventilatory failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure-She has evidence on CXR of some hyperinflation
   which has been seen throughout.  The reason for intubation was
   respiratory compromise in the setting of sepsis.  At this time she has
   favorable pulmonary mechanics (Resist=8, Complicance=40) and we have
   moved to diuresis to continue to create favorable conditions for
   extubation.
   -Will move to PSV and SBT trial today
   -Source of failure may be related to excess dead space
will measure
   Vd/Vt if recurrent hypercarbia seen
   -Will check NIF to consider weakness as possible source for failure in
   the setting of favorable pulmonary mechanics and recurrent hypercarbia
   -Hope to move to extubation today

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted with urosepsis, complicated by shock and respiratory failure. She has been experiencing worsening respiratory failure, with evidence of hypercarbia and unfavorable Respiratory System Compliance (RSBI). The patient's condition includes sepsis, hypokalemia, altered mental status, hypotension, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/45 mmHg to 160/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 75%. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), and she has a first-degree AV block. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,577 mL and output of 3,105 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 528 mL. The patient's weight is currently 60 kg, with a decrease from her admission weight of 49.5 kg. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.9-7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 147-153 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 117-"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, and UTI. The source of sepsis is likely the urine, although there may be another source given the presence of MRSA in the sputum. The patient's blood cultures from November 9th (day of admission) were negative. She is no longer requiring pressors, although her blood pressure is low, and she is making urine. Stool tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) have been negative three times, and Flagyl has been stopped.

The patient has respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia. She is volume overloaded due to fluid resuscitation, and there may be pneumonia and pleural effusions. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial yesterday due to a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) greater than 130 and increasing acidosis. The reason why she cannot be weaned off the ventilator is unclear. A chest X-ray shows slight improvement in fluid overload. The patient has hyperinflated lungs and CO2 retention without acidosis on admission. There is no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it may be undiagnosed thus far. The negative inspiratory force (NIF) is poor at -16 cmH2O,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are detailed at the beginning of the note. The patient has been experiencing changes in respiratory support, including transitioning from PSV to MMV, and has shown episodes of apnea. The NIF calculation indicates a value of 16, and the dead space calculation on PSV is 70%. The patient has been on Flagyl, but it has been discontinued. Vancomycin trough levels show a value of 15.1, and phosphorus levels have been repleted. Additionally, the patient required re-suturing of an IJ line, which is now in good position and will be further evaluated through a CXR. Diuresis has resulted in a negative fluid balance of -700cc, meeting the desired goal.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ampicillin/sulbactam, metronidazole, vancomycin, and ampicillin. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis and other ICU medications.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), while the current temperature is 37.2 degrees Celsius (98.9 degrees Fahrenheit). The heart rate ranges between 58 and 69 beats per minute, with a blood pressure of 118/47 mmHg"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Source is likely
   urine given pyuria, though may have something in her [**Known lastname **] as well given
   MRSA in sputum.  UCx grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum
   growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**] (day of admission) are negative. Patient
   no longer requiring pressors although blood pressure low patient is
   making urine
   - no CBC this am, to check today
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - D/C flagyl for 2x negative CDiff
   - F/u blood Cx from [**11-12**]
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 60, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Likely now volume
   overloaded due to fluid resuscitation.  Also possible PNA and pleural
   effusions. Patient failed SBT yesterday due to RSBI >130 and increasing
   acidosis.  Unclear why patient unable to be weaned off vent. CXR may
   show slight improvement in fluid overload.  Patient w/slightly
   hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention  w/out acidosis on admission. No
   Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.
   - check cxr today
   - dead space calculation
   - try to wean to Pressure support (on assist-control today)
   - Follow ABG
   - continue duiresis with Lasix gtt today
   - PM lytes, monitor K and creatinine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue current free water boluses 300 q 3 hours, consider reducing
   if becomes hyponatremic
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient is extubated once again.  During the interval time between
   extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the family
   to be near baseline.
   - Consider imaging tomorrow if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1^st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Paroxysmal afib:
   - Confirm not an anticoagulation candidate
   .
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds

","The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) presenting with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, and UTI. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a complicated medical history including MRSA in sputum, Proteus mirabilis in urine, and possible pneumonia (PNA) with pleural effusions. The patient also has hypernatremia, likely due to extreme dehydration, and bradycardia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 58 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a CVP of 1 mmHg. The patient is receiving fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics for sepsis. She is also receiving diuretics to manage fluid overload. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 thousand/mm^3, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes, elevated troponin T level, and elevated lactate level.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis, and AMS. She has been diagnosed with MRSA in her sputum and Proteus mirabilis in her urine. She is currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV) due to respiratory failure. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 118/47-147/60 mmHg, heart rate of 58 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a history of bradycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances. Her chest X-ray reveals a right internal jugular vein at the cavotrial junction, endotracheal tube placement 5 cm above the female first name, nasogastric tube in the stomach, and moderate-sized pleural effusions. The patient's family has agreed to full code status, including reintubation if she fails extubation.

","The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure. The initial infectious insult has resolved, but there are significant concerns about the patient's capacity to successfully move to extubation and independent ventilation. The patient's increased dead space ventilation and weakness are contributing to persistent ventilatory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently compromised, and there is a need for ongoing respiratory support. Extubation may be considered after a successful spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), but this decision will depend on various factors such as the patient's mental status, sedation level, and ventilatory motor strength.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, it is important to complete the course of antibiotics and closely monitor for any signs of recurrence.

3. Peripheral Edema: The patient may be at risk of developing peripheral edema due to fluid balance issues and diuresis management.

4. Diarrhea: The patient may experience diarrhea as a side effect of certain medications or due to an underlying gastrointestinal infection.

5. Hypokalemia (Low Potassium) and Hypopotassemia: These electrolyte imbalances can occur due to diuretic use, fluid shifts, or other factors. Monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary to maintain the patient's overall health.

6. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient's current sepsis"

   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative. Patient no longer requiring pressors.
   Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3 & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day
   7 of Vanco, Day 5 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - F/u blood Cx from [**11-12**]
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 60, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Continues to fail SBTs with high RSBIs.
   Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention  without
   acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space ventilation (70%
   on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased
   respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.
   - Continue on Pressure support as tolerated
   - SBT today and re-check ABG in 1hr -> if tolerates SBT, extubate to
   BiPAP
   - continue duiresis gently with Lasix gtt today
   - PM lytes, monitor K and creatinine
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient is extubated once again.  During the interval time between
   extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the family
   to be near baseline.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue current free water boluses 300 q 3 hours, consider reducing
   if becomes hyponatremic
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1^st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.
- The patient initially had fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine culture grew pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, and sputum grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Blood cultures from 11/9 were negative.
- She is no longer requiring pressors and has been on vancomycin and Unasyn for MRSA and Proteus infection, respectively.
- The patient continues to fail spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) with high respiratory system compliance (RSBIs).
- She has slightly hyperinflated lungs and CO2 retention without acidosis on admission. There is no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it may be undiagnosed. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator is likely due to decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying intrinsic lung disease.
- The plan is to continue pressure support as tolerated, recheck arterial blood gas (ABG) in 1 hour, and if the patient tolerates SBT, extubate to BiPAP. Gently diuresis with Lasix will also be continued.

   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative. Patient no longer requiring pressors.
   Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3 & flagyl stopped [**11-15**].
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - F/u blood Cx from [**11-12**]
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 60, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Continues to fail SBTs with high RSBIs.
   Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention  without
   acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space ventilation (70%
   on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased
   respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.
   - Continue on Pressure support as tolerated
   - Continue SBT as tolerated
   - Follow ABG
   - continue duiresis with Lasix gtt today
   - PM lytes, monitor K and creatinine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue current free water boluses 300 q 3 hours, consider reducing
   if becomes hyponatremic
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient is extubated once again.  During the interval time between
   extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the family
   to be near baseline.
   - Consider imaging tomorrow if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1^st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient initially had fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine grew out pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, and sputum grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Blood cultures from November 9th are negative. The patient is no longer requiring pressors. Stool tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) are negative three times, and Flagyl was stopped on November 15th.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, initially presenting with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. The presence of pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis and MRSA indicates a bacterial infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to manage this condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to experience respiratory failure characterized by hypoxia and hypercarbia. Initially thought to be due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia with pleural effusions, it is now believed to be a combination of decreased respiratory muscle strength and underlying intrinsic lung disease. The patient will continue on pressure support as tolerated, undergo spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs),"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient initially had fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine culture grew out pan-sensitive Proteus Mirabilis, and sputum grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Blood cultures from 11/9 were negative. The patient is no longer requiring pressors. Stool tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) were negative three times, and Flagyl was stopped on 11/15. The plan is to continue Vancomycin and Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine. Follow-up blood cultures from 11/12 are pending. The target central venous pressure (CVP) is 8-15, mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, and mixed venous saturation >70%.

The patient also has respiratory failure due to hypoxia and hypercarbia. Initially, it was thought to be due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia with pleural effusions. She continues to fail spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) with high respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The patient has slightly hyperinflated lungs and CO2 retention without acidosis on"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female admit iniitally with sepsis who now has continued and
   prolonged course of ventilatory failure.  She has barriers to
   extubation of neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive [**Known lastname **]
   disease leading to increased dead space ventilation.  With decrease in
   her levels of pressure support her tidal volume decreases quite quickly
   and her dead space ventilation is substantially increased leading to
   hypercarbia and persistent ventilatory failure. This is a challenging
   balance and would suggest that this prolonged course of ventilatory
   failure may be most readily assessed and managed over a prolonged
   period with chronic support with tracheostomy with maximal safety in
   weaning.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Given the patient with much improved mental
   status today
this would make it likely that this represents an optimal
   opportunity for trial of extubation today with continued expectation
   for intermittent BIPAP support with non-invasive ventilation.  If she
   fails will have to consider tracheostomy but this represents a clear
   opportunity for trial of extubation.
   -Continue with PSV to continue 15/5, FIO2=0.4
   -Will continue with diuresis
   -Will need tracheostomy for chronic ventilatory support if unable to
   increase spontaneous effective ventilation
   -WIll discuss with family in detail the role of tracheostomy over time
   -Continue Diamox
   2)Sepsis-
   -Improved and maintained hemodynamics
   -Continue with antibiotics
   -C. Diff negative x3
   -Vanco/Unasyn to continue
   3)Volume Overload-
   -Lasix as tolerated to negative fluid balance
   -Will need to stabilize HCO3-

","The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted initially with sepsis and now experiencing prolonged ventilatory failure. She has barriers to extubation, including neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, leading to increased dead space ventilation. With a decrease in pressure support, her tidal volume decreases quickly, resulting in hypercarbia and persistent ventilatory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular weakness. There is a need for ongoing respiratory support, and the possibility of a tracheostomy may be considered if she is unable to maintain spontaneous effective ventilation.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's hemodynamics have improved, there is still a concern for ongoing infection as evidenced by the continued use of antibiotics. Monitoring for any signs of deterioration and maintaining appropriate infection control measures is important.

3. Volume Overload: The patient may be at risk of volume overload, as indicated by her current fluid balance. The use of diuretics like Lasix will be necessary to achieve a negative fluid balance and stabilize her condition.

Other potential complications include impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, diarrhea, hypokalemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative. Patient no longer requiring pressors.
   Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3 & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day
   7 of Vanco, Day 5 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - F/u blood Cx from [**11-12**]
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 60, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Continues to fail SBTs with high RSBIs.
   Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention  without
   acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space ventilation (70%
   on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased
   respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.
   - Continue on Pressure support as tolerated
   - SBT today and re-check ABG in 1hr -> if tolerates SBT, extubate to
   BiPAP
   - continue duiresis gently with Lasix gtt today
   - PM lytes, monitor K and creatinine
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient is extubated once again.  During the interval time between
   extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the family
   to be near baseline.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue current free water boluses 300 q 3 hours, consider reducing
   if becomes hyponatremic
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1^st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Paroxysmal afib:
   - Confirm not an anticoagulation candidate

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She presented with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.
- Initial assessment revealed fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine culture grew out pan-sensitive Proteus Mirabilis, and sputum grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
- Blood cultures from November 9th were negative. The patient no longer requires pressors.
- Stool tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) were negative three times, and Flagyl was stopped on November 15th.
- The patient is currently on day 7 of vancomycin and day 5 of Unasyn.
- The plan is to continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine, follow up blood cultures from November 12th, and maintain central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-15, mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and mixed venous saturation above 70%.

- The patient also has respiratory failure due to hypoxia and hypercarbia, initially attributed to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia with pleural eff"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   .
   # Hypotension: Responsive to fluid boluses last night.  Pt received 4L
   NS with good urine output.  Baseline is probably low.  Likely secondary
   to medications surrounding intubation.  Unlikely to be sepsis given
   that pt is afebrile, no WBCs and continuing treatment with abxs.
   - pt normotensive currently, will hold off on diuresis today for better
   hemodynamic stability
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative. Patient no longer requiring pressors.
   Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3 & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day
   7 of Vanco, Day 5 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - F/u blood Cx from [**11-12**]
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 60, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Continues to fail SBTs with high RSBIs.
   Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention  without
   acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space ventilation (70%
   on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased
   respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.
   - Continue on Pressure support as tolerated
   - SBT today and re-check ABG in 1hr -> if tolerates SBT, extubate to
   BiPAP
   - continue duiresis gently with Lasix gtt today
   - PM lytes, monitor K and creatinine
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient initially presented with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. She was intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, which were responsive to fluid boluses. It is likely secondary to medications surrounding intubation rather than sepsis. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 in the presence of normal urine output.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine cultures grew out pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, and sputum cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Blood cultures from November 12 are pending. The patient is currently on day 7 of vancomycin and day 5 of Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn). Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine. Follow-up blood cultures are also recommended.

3. Respiratory failure: The"

   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   .
   # Hypotension: Responsive to fluid boluses last night.  Pt received 4L
   NS with good urine output.  Baseline is probably low.  Likely secondary
   to medications surrounding intubation.  Unlikely to be sepsis given
   that pt is afebrile, no WBCs and continuing treatment with abxs.
   - pt normotensive currently, will hold off on diuresis today for better
   hemodynamic stability
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures, mixed venous, CVPs
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative. Patient no longer requiring pressors.
   Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3 & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day
   8 of Vanco, Day 6 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 55, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Continues to fail SBTs with high RSBIs.
   Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention  without
   acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space ventilation (70%
   on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased
   respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   - consider trach after discussing with HCP as pt is unlikely to be
   weaned from ventilator
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated due to worsening acidosis and hypercarbia, and then extubated but required re-intubation again for the same reasons. She also experienced hypotension, which responded to fluid boluses, and respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by MRSA and a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis. She has been treated with vancomycin and Unasyn antibiotics. The patient's mental status appeared to be near baseline during the interval time between extubation and re-intubation, but imaging is considered if there is no improvement toward baseline. Her hypernatremia has resolved. The patient has a history of bradycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but her current rhythm is a first-degree AV block. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be dispositioned to ICU level care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease and respiratory failure. She was initially admitted with sepsis and now has prolonged ventilatory failure. She has barriers to extubation, including neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, leading to increased dead space ventilation. The patient's levels of pressure support have decreased, resulting in decreased tidal volume and increased dead space ventilation, causing hypercarbia and persistent ventilatory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation and could not tolerate non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), indicating severe respiratory distress. A tracheostomy may be the next logical move to manage prolonged ventilatory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient was initially admitted with sepsis and maintained hemodynamics. However, she was hypotensive overnight after reintubation and showed signs of fluid responsiveness. Cultures were taken, and antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) were continued. No obvious sources of infection were identified.
3. Volume Overload: The patient needs to stabilize her bicarbonate levels and achieve a negative fluid balance. Lasix was administered as tolerated. The nasogastric tube was switched to an orogastric tube.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to sepsis and prolonged ventilatory failure. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as dialysis, may be required"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease and respiratory failure. She was initially admitted with sepsis and has since developed prolonged ventilatory failure. The patient has been on invasive ventilation but failed extubation attempts due to neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) leading to increased dead space ventilation. Her mental status has improved, but she still requires respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors including pulm edema, weakness, and high dead space. The next logical move would be to consider tracheostomy for chronic support with maximal safety in weaning. The patient should continue with pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 15/5, with FiO2 set at 0.4.

2. Sepsis: The patient was hypotensive overnight after reintubation, which was fluid responsive. Potential sources of infection include [Last Name (LF) 2643], [First Name3 (LF)], and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient should continue with vancomycin and zosyn. Culturing should be done to identify the source of infection.

3. Volume Overload: The patient has worsened after reintubation with volume resuscitation but maintains stable oxygenation. Switching the nasogastric tube to an orogastric tube (OG"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   89 yo female admit initially with sepsis who now has continued and
   prolonged course of ventilatory failure.  She has barriers to
   extubation of neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive [**Known lastname **]
   disease leading to increased dead space ventilation.  With decrease in
   her levels of pressure support her tidal volume decreases quite quickly
   and her dead space ventilation is substantially increased leading to
   hypercarbia and persistent ventilatory failure. This is a challenging
   balance and would suggest that this prolonged course of ventilatory
   failure may be most readily assessed and managed over a prolonged
   period with chronic support with tracheostomy with maximal safety in
   weaning.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Given the patients improved mental status
   yesterday
 she was given anpther attempt at extunation but failed even
   with NIPPV. Tracheostomy but this represents a clear opportunity for
   trial of extubation.
   -Continue with PSV to continue 15/5, FIO2=0.4
   -Will continue with diuresis
   -Will need tracheostomy for chronic ventilatory support if unable to
   increase spontaneous effective ventilation
   -WIll discuss with family in detail the role of tracheostomy over time
   -Continue Diamox

   -Improved and maintained hemodynamics
   -Continue with antibiotics

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease and respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis and has shown prolonged ventilatory failure. The patient has barriers to extubation, including neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, leading to increased dead space ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/46 to 202/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on invasive ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and respiratory system compliance at 33.3 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte levels. However, the creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.0 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%.

   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   .
   # Hypotension: Responsive to fluid boluses last night.  Pt received 4L
   NS with good urine output.  Baseline is probably low.  Likely secondary
   to medications surrounding intubation.  Unlikely to be sepsis given
   that pt is afebrile, no WBCs and continuing treatment with abxs.
   - pt normotensive currently, will hold off on diuresis today for better
   hemodynamic stability
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures, mixed venous, CVPs
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative. Patient no longer requiring pressors.
   Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3 & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day
   8 of Vanco, Day 6 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - CVP goal [**8-15**], MAP > 55, and Mixed venous sat > 70%.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Continues to fail SBTs with high RSBIs.
   Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention  without
   acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space ventilation (70%
   on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased
   respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   - consider trach after discussing with HCP as pt is unlikely to be
   weaned from ventilator
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient is extubated once again.  During the interval time between
   extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the family
   to be near baseline.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue current free water boluses 300 q 3 hours, consider reducing

   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1^st degree

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's hypotension responded to fluid boluses last night. She received 4 liters of normal saline with good urine output. The baseline blood pressure is likely low, possibly secondary to medications surrounding intubation. The patient is currently normotensive, and diuresis will be held off for better hemodynamic stability. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 in a patient with normal urine output. Cultures, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), and central venous pressures (CVP) will be closely monitored.

The patient had sepsis initially with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine cultures grew out pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, and sputum grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Blood cultures from November 9th are negative. The patient is currently on day 8 of vancomycin and day 6 of ampicillin/sulbactam. Continue"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now w/hypotension on pressors,  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   .
   # Hypotension: Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt received
   4L NS overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but throughout
   the day on the 15^th was persistently hypotensive and required dopamine
   (concern for increasing fluid load as patient develops pulmonary
   edema)  To note, baseline BP seems to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range
   still result in good urine output.  Thought likely secondary to
   medications surrounding intubation, but b/c of persistent hypotension
   requiring dopamine, patient was pan cultured and a repeat CXR was
   ordered.  UA showed pyuria and sputum showed GNR. Likely hypotension is
   due to urosepsis vs sepsis from pna.
   - add G- antibiotic coverage w/gentamycin until sensitivities and
   cultures from urine and sputum are resulted
   - try to wean dopamine
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative.  Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3
   & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day 9 of Vanco, Day 7 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - Gentamycin started as described above
   - Surv BCx
   - examine IJ site for signs of infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Failed several SBTs with high RSBIs and
   acidosis.  Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention
   without acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be
   undiagnosed thus far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space
   ventilation (70% on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a
   mix of decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying
   intrinsic [**Known lastname **] disease.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   -          HCP would like tracheostomy
   -          To consult for tracheostomy placement next week, once septic
   shock has resolved
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1^st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hypernatremic.
   - decrease free water boluses to 250 q 6 hours, consider reducing if
   becomes hyponatremic

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. Initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice for worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. Currently, the patient is hypotensive on pressors, pyuria, and gram-negative rods (GNR) in sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension requiring dopamine. There is concern for increasing fluid overload as the patient develops pulmonary edema. Baseline blood pressure seems to be low, and mean arterial pressures in the 55-60 range still result in good urine output. The hypotension may be secondary to medications surrounding intubation, but persistent hypotension requiring dopamine suggests urosepsis or sepsis from pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine grew pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, and sputum is growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Blood cultures from 11/9 are negative. Stool tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) are negative three times, and flagyl was"

   and her dead space ventilation is substantially increased leading to
   hypercarbia and persistent ventilatory failure. This is a challenging

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female who was initially admitted with sepsis and now has prolonged ventilatory failure. The patient has neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, making extubation challenging. The patient's tidal volume decreases quickly when pressure support is decreased, leading to hypercarbia and persistent ventilatory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced failed extubation twice, and a tracheostomy is being considered as the next logical move to manage prolonged ventilatory failure. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or pressure support ventilation (PSV) will be continued.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on vasopressor support and has positive cultures for GNR bacteria in urine and sputum. The current antibiotic regimen includes vancomycin, zosyn, and gentamicin. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening sepsis or development of new infections.

3. Volume Overload: The patient is experiencing worsening volume overload after reintubation, which may be exacerbated by recent volume resuscitation. This could lead to fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid restriction and possibly dialysis, may be necessary.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female who was initially admitted with sepsis and now has a prolonged course of ventilatory failure. She has barriers to extubation due to neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), leading to increased dead space ventilation. The patient's respiratory failure is persistent despite pressure support, and there is a concern for hypercarbia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the current situation include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to failed extubation attempts and her underlying COPD. The next logical move suggested in the note is tracheostomy, as it can provide chronic support and facilitate weaning off mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is indicated by the presence of infection markers such as leukocytosis and positive cultures for GNR bacteria. The current antibiotic regimen includes Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Gentamicin. Continuous monitoring for any signs of septic shock and adjusting the antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.

3. Volume Overload: The patient experienced worsening volume overload after reintubation, which could be due to fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring of fluid balance and hemodynamic parameters is necessary to prevent further fluid accumulation and associated complications.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen suggest impaired renal function. The use"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted with sepsis and prolonged ventilatory failure.
- She has neuromuscular weakness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), making extubation challenging.
- The patient's respiratory failure is due to a combination of factors such as pulmonary edema, weakness, and high dead space ventilation.
- She has failed previous attempts at extubation, including one with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
- The next logical step is to consider a tracheostomy for chronic support with weaning.
- The patient remains hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, and potential sources of sepsis include [Last Name (LF) 2643], [First Name3 (LF)], and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for sepsis.
- The patient also has volume overload, which worsened after reintubation.
- Other issues include impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, diarrhea, hypokalemia, altered mental status (not delirium), and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors such as pulmonary edema, neuromuscular weakness, and high dead space ventilation. A tracheostomy may be necessary for chronic support and weaning.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now w/hypotension on pressors,  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   .
   # Hypotension: Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt received
   4L NS overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but throughout
   the day on the 15^th was persistently hypotensive and required dopamine
   (concern for increasing fluid load as patient develops pulmonary
   edema)  To note, baseline BP seems to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range
   still result in good urine output.  Thought likely secondary to
   medications surrounding intubation, but b/c of persistent hypotension
   requiring dopamine, patient was pan cultured and a repeat CXR was
   ordered.  UA showed pyuria and sputum showed GNR. Likely hypotension is
   due to urosepsis vs sepsis from pna.
   - add G- antibiotic coverage w/gentamycin until sensitivities and
   cultures from urine and sputum are resulted
   - try to wean dopamine
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative.  Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3
   & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day 9 of Vanco, Day 7 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - Gentamycin started as described above
   - Surv BCx
   - examine IJ site for signs of infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Failed several SBTs with high RSBIs and
   acidosis.  Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention
   without acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be
   undiagnosed thus far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space
   ventilation (70% on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a
   mix of decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying
   intrinsic [**Known lastname **] disease.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   -          HCP would like tracheostomy
   -          To consult for tracheostomy placement next week, once septic
   shock has resolved
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1^st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hypernatremic.
   - decrease free water boluses to 250 q 6 hours, consider reducing if
   becomes hyponatremic
   # Paroxysmal afib:
   - Confirm not an anticoagulation candidate
   .
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN: Tolerating TF at goal; check lytes in AM

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) presenting with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. She was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. The patient is currently on dopamine for hypotension, which may be secondary to urosepsis or sepsis from pneumonia. She has been pan cultured, and a repeat chest X-ray has been ordered. Urine analysis showed pyuria, and sputum showed gram-negative rods (GNR). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires dopamine to maintain blood pressure, indicating persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. This could be due to sepsis or urosepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has failed several spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) with high respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) and acidosis. She is unable to wean off the ventilator, likely due to decreased respiratory muscle strength and intrinsic lung disease.
3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine culture grew pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, while sputum culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphyloc"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   D/c
d pressors today, but with pyuria, recent MRSA in sputum, and now
   GNR in sputum.
   # Respiratory failure: Had hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Initially
   felt to be due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible
   pneumonia with pleural effusions.  Failed several SBTs with high RSBIs
   and acidosis.  Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2
   retention without acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be
   undiagnosed thus far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space
   ventilation (70% on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a
   mix of decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying
   intrinsic [**Known lastname **] disease.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   -          HCP would like tracheostomy
   -          To consult for tracheostomy placement next week, once septic
   shock has resolved
   .
   # Hypotension: Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt received
   4L NS overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but throughout
   the day on the 15^th was persistently hypotensive and required dopamine
   (concern for increasing fluid load as patient develops pulmonary
   edema).  To note, baseline BP seems to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range
   still result in good urine output.  Thought likely secondary to
   medications surrounding intubation, but b/c of persistent hypotension
   requiring dopamine, patient was pan cultured and a repeat CXR was
   ordered.  UA showed pyuria and sputum showed GNR. Likely hypotension is
   due to urosepsis vs sepsis from pna.
   - add G- antibiotic coverage w/gentamycin until sensitivities and
   cultures from urine and sputum are resulted
   - try to wean dopamine
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative.  Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3
   & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day 9 of Vanco, Day 7 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - Gentamycin started as described above
   - Surv BCx
   - examine IJ site for signs of infection
   .
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1^st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hypernatremic.
   - decrease free water boluses to 250 q 6 hours, consider reducing if
   becomes hyponatremic
   # Paroxysmal afib:
   - Confirm not an anticoagulation candidate

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.

2. The patient has failed several spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) due to high respiratory system compliance and intrinsic lung disease. She has been reintubated twice and is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

3. The patient's blood pressure has been persistently low despite fluid resuscitation, and she required dopamine for hemodynamic support. There is concern for fluid overload, as evidenced by the development of pulmonary edema. The patient also has pyuria and gram-negative rods (GNRs) in her sputum, suggesting a possible urinary tract source of infection.

4. The patient's initial sepsis was attributed to MRSA in the sputum and Proteus mirabilis in the urine. She has been receiving vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) for MRSA and Proteus, respectively. Gentamicin has been added for coverage against GNRs.

5. The patient's mental status appears to have"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female with initial admission with sepsis from likely urinary
   source now with recurrent respiratory failure despite the optimization
   of her volume status and then trial of extubation in the setting of
   increased Vd/Vt and weakness with NIF > -20.  She had been trialed on
   BIPAP via mask with some capacity to support off ventilator but his was
   only for a brief period of time.  Over the weekend she evolved
   recurrent and persistent hypotension consistend with sepsis and with
   likely pulmonary source patient did required re-intubation with
   possible VAP as source for decline.  This does appear to be
   substantially more significant than just persistence of her background
   [**Known lastname **] disease and concern for infection with pneumonia is significant.
   She now has failed extubation x2 despite maximal efforts to optimize
   her chances for success.
   Sepsis-Again, is likley recurrent sepsis in the setting of ventilatory
   associated pneumonia.  This may have been a combination of underlying
   [**Known lastname **] disease and hypovolemia and autopeep contributing to acute
   hypotension but persistent insult requiring pressors may well be
   related to recurrent sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with initial admission for sepsis from a likely urinary source. She has now developed recurrent respiratory failure despite optimization of volume status and attempts at extubation. She has been re-intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of significant sepsis. The patient's medical history includes known COPD disease, and she has failed extubation twice despite maximal efforts to optimize her chances for success. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, edema, diarrhea, hypokalemia, altered mental status, hypotension, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recurrent respiratory failure and re-intubation increase the risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing sepsis poses a significant risk and may lead to further organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure can progress to AKI, which may require dialysis.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and edema increase the risk of DVT.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's underlying COPD and current respiratory failure increase the risk of developing community-acquired pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now off pressors, but with  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   # Hypotension:  Likely hypotension is due to urosepsis vs sepsis from
   pna.  Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt received 4L NS
   overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but throughout the
   day on the 15th was persistently hypotensive.  This was at first
   assumed to be [**2-4**] sedation administered during re-intubation, but
   hypotension persisted, requiring dopamine.   Of note, baseline BP seems
   to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range still result in good urine output.
   Cardiogenic causes also possible, as patient  has some
   electrophysiologic abnormalities, may be unable to mount sufficient
   increased cardiac output to deal with requirements.
   - add G- antibiotic coverage w/gentamicin and Zosyn until sensitivities
   and cultures from urine and sputum are resulted
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   -EP consult
   -hold diuresis during day, readdress in evening based on BP and UOP.
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, treated with cipro.  Sputum growing
   MRSA.  Now on Day 10 of Vanco.  Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro
   and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   -Continue Vancomycin for MRSA
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn  started as described above
   -Check gentamicin peak and trough after 4^th dose.  Check vanco trough
   - Surveillance BCx
   - examine IJ site for signs of infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission, and is
   now volume overloaded. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased of
   all of these factors.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   -Consult IP today for trach and G-tube placement
   -Continue on PSV
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP consult today to consider pacer placement to aid with hypotension.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hyponatremic.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. She is currently off pressors but has pyuria and gram-negative rods (GNRs) in her sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to urosepsis versus sepsis from pneumonia. She responded to fluid boluses initially but continues to be hypotensive despite dopamine infusion. Cardiogenic causes are also possible, as the patient has some electrophysiologic abnormalities that may prevent her from mounting sufficient increased cardiac output.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Her urine grew out pan-sensitive Proteus Mirabilis, treated with ciprofloxacin. However, her sputum is growing MRSA, and she has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been switched from ciprofloxacin and Unasyn to gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxia and hypercarbia"

   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now off pressors, but with  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   # Hypotension:  Likely hypotension is due to urosepsis vs sepsis from
   pna.  Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt received 4L NS

   increased cardiac output to deal with requirements.
   - add G- antibiotic coverage w/gentamicin and Zosyn until sensitivities

   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   -EP consult
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, treated with cipro.  Sputum growing
   MRSA.  Now on Day 10 of Vanco.  Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro

d, begun on gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   -Continue Vancomycin for MRSA
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn  started as described above
   - Surv BCx
   - examine IJ site for signs of infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Failed several SBTs with high RSBIs and
   acidosis.  Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention
   without acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be
   undiagnosed thus far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space
   ventilation (70% on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a
   mix of decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying
   intrinsic [**Known lastname **] disease.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   -          HCP would like tracheostomy
   -          To consult for tracheostomy placement next week, once septic
   shock has resolved

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice for worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and potential flash pulmonary edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has persistently low blood pressure despite fluid resuscitation, which could be due to urosepsis or sepsis from pneumonia. This may require further management with vasopressors.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. She has been treated with various antibiotics, but the presence of GNRs in her sputum suggests a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Continued monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has failed several spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) with high respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) and acidosis. She also has hyperinflated lungs and CO2 retention. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to decreased respiratory muscle strength and underlying intrinsic lung disease. A tracheostomy placement may be considered once septic shock resolves.

4. Altered mental status"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now off pressors, but with  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   # Hypotension: Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt received
   4L NS overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but throughout
   the day on the 15th was persistently hypotensive and required dopamine
   (concern for increasing fluid load as patient develops pulmonary
   edema)  To note, baseline BP seems to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range
   still result in good urine output.  Thought likely secondary to
   medications surrounding intubation, but b/c of persistent hypotension
   requiring dopamine, patient was pan cultured and a repeat CXR was
   ordered.  UA showed pyuria and sputum showed GNR. Likely hypotension is
   due to urosepsis vs sepsis from pna.
   - add G- antibiotic coverage w/gentamycin until sensitivities and
   cultures from urine and sputum are resulted
   - try to wean dopamine
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative.  Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3
   & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day 9 of Vanco, Day 7 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - Gentamycin started as described above
   - Surv BCx
   - examine IJ site for signs of infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Failed several SBTs with high RSBIs and
   acidosis.  Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention
   without acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be
   undiagnosed thus far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space
   ventilation (70% on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a
   mix of decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying
   intrinsic [**Known lastname **] disease.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   -          HCP would like tracheostomy
   -          To consult for tracheostomy placement next week, once septic
   shock has resolved
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hypernatremic.
   - decrease free water boluses to 250 q 6 hours, consider reducing if
   becomes hyponatremic

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now off pressors, but with  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   # Hypotension: Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt received
   4L NS overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but throughout
   the day on the 15th was persistently hypotensive and required dopamine
   (concern for increasing fluid load as patient develops pulmonary
   edema)  To note, baseline BP seems to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range
   still result in good urine output.  Thought likely secondary to
   medications surrounding intubation, but b/c of persistent hypotension
   requiring dopamine, patient was pan cultured and a repeat CXR was
   ordered.  UA showed pyuria and sputum showed GNR. Likely hypotension is
   due to urosepsis vs sepsis from pna.
   - add G- antibiotic coverage w/gentamycin until sensitivities and
   cultures from urine and sputum are resulted
   - try to wean dopamine
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, sputum growing MRSA.  BCx from [**11-9**]
   (day of admission) are negative.  Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3
   & flagyl stopped [**11-15**]. Now on Day 9 of Vanco, Day 7 of Unasyn.
   - Continue Vanc/Unasyn for MRSA in sputum and Proteus in urine
   - Gentamycin started as described above
   - Surv BCx
   - examine IJ site for signs of infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Initially felt to be
   due to volume overload from fluid resuscitation and possible pneumonia
   with pleural effusions.  Failed several SBTs with high RSBIs and
   acidosis.  Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention
   without acidosis on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be
   undiagnosed thus far.   NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space
   ventilation (70% on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a
   mix of decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying
   intrinsic [**Known lastname **] disease.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   -          HCP would like tracheostomy
   -          To consult for tracheostomy placement next week, once septic
   shock has resolved
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -If patient drops HR <40, EKG
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hypernatremic.
   - decrease free water boluses to 250 q 6 hours, consider reducing if
   becomes hyponatremic
   # Paroxysmal afib
   - Confirm not an anticoagulation candidate
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, and UTI, and was initially intubated due to worsening acidosis and hypercarbia. The patient required dopamine for persistent hypotension and developed pulmonary edema. She was pan cultured, and a repeat chest X-ray was ordered. Urine analysis showed pyuria, and sputum culture grew gram-negative rods (GNRs). 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, bradycardia, hypernatremia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization.
3. Stress ulcers due to critical illness and use of corticosteroids.
4. Further deterioration in mental status if sepsis is not adequately controlled.
5. Complications related to hypernatremia, such as seizures or neurological damage.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias, including worsening bradycardia or atrial fibrillation.
7. Failure to wean off mechanical ventilation due to underlying intrinsic lung disease."

   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now off pressors, but with  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission, and is
   now volume overloaded. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.  Now pt. may have VAP as sputum is growing GNRs, awaiting
   speciation.  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of
   decreased of all of these factors.  Pt has now failed re-intubation
   twice.
   - Cont. gent & zosyn for presumed VAP until speciation available.
   - Cont. Vanco for MRSA started on evening of [**11-10**].
   -Trach & PEG on [**11-22**], NPO after midnight for procedure
   -Continue on PSV as tolerated.
   - diurese as permitted by BP
   # Hypotension:  Initially likely hypotension is due to urosepsis vs
   sepsis from pna.  Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt
   received 4L NS overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but
   throughout the day on the 15th was persistently hypotensive.  This was
   at first assumed to be [**2-4**] sedation administered during re-intubation,
   but hypotension persisted, requiring dopamine.   Of note, baseline BP
   seems to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range still result in good urine
   output.  Cardiogenic causes also possible, as patient  has some
   electrophysiologic abnormalities, may be unable to mount sufficient
   increased cardiac output to deal with requirements.  EP feels that pt.
   is not a candidate for pacemaker given presumed sepsis.
   - treat infections as above
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever, hypotension,
   hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, treated with
   cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].  Sputum grew
   GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on gentamicin and
   Zosyn for VAP.   Vanco level this am not true trough.  Will recheck
   tomorrow.
   -Continue Vancomycin for MRSA
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn  started as described above
   -Check gentamicin peak and trough after 4^th dose.  Check vanco trough
   - Surveillance BCx
   - Remove IJ line.
   .
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt

   -EP consult today to consider pacer placement to aid with hypotension.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hyponatremic.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.

- The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema.

- She is currently off pressors but has pyuria and growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in sputum, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

- The patient's respiratory failure is characterized by hypoxia and hypercarbia. There is a low respiratory rate and CO2 retention after the latest extubation, suggesting neuromuscular weakness. However, persistent A-a gradient on the latest arterial blood gas (ABG) suggests intrinsic lung disease. The patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission, and is now volume overloaded. There is no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it may be undiagnosed thus far.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now off pressors, but with  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   # Hypotension:  Likely hypotension is due to urosepsis vs sepsis from
   pna.  Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt received 4L NS
   overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but throughout the
   day on the 15th was persistently hypotensive.  This was at first
   assumed to be [**2-4**] sedation administered during re-intubation, but
   hypotension persisted, requiring dopamine.   Of note, baseline BP seems
   to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range still result in good urine output.
   Cardiogenic causes also possible, as patient  has some
   electrophysiologic abnormalities, may be unable to mount sufficient
   increased cardiac output to deal with requirements.
   - add G- antibiotic coverage w/gentamicin and Zosyn until sensitivities
   and cultures from urine and sputum are resulted
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   -EP consult
   -hold diuresis during day, readdress in evening based on BP and UOP.
   # Sepsis: Initially with fever, hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out
   pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, treated with cipro.  Sputum growing
   MRSA.  Now on Day 10 of Vanco.  Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro
   and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   -Continue Vancomycin for MRSA
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn  started as described above
   -Check gentamicin peak and trough after 4^th dose.  Check vanco trough
   - Surveillance BCx
   - examine IJ site for signs of infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission, and is
   now volume overloaded. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased of
   all of these factors.  Pt has now failed re-intubation twice.
   -Consult IP today for trach and G-tube placement
   -Continue on PSV
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP consult today to consider pacer placement to aid with hypotension.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hyponatremic.
   - decrease free water boluses to 150 q 6 hours
   # Paroxysmal afib
   - Not an anticoagulation candidate
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) who presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, and pneumonia. She was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice for worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 279 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her respiratory support includes fentanyl and heparin sodium.

Her vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 54 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 90/43 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. She has sinus bradycardia and crackles throughout her chest bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.9 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level (Na+) of 142 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 31.3 mg/dL, and creatinine (Cr) level of 0"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female admit initially with urosepsis and now with persistent
   ventilatory failure despite optimal management of ventilator
   dependence.  This ventilator dependence would appear to be primarily

   tachypnea and rapid shallow breathing in the setting of PSV decrease
   worsening Vd/Vt--IP has raised the possbilitiy of pleural effusion
   contributing as well.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue with A/C support today with PSV trials
   -Trach and PEG tomorrow
   -Will need prolonged weaning approach with likely intermittent need for
   ventilatory support
   2)Sepsis--Stabilized from the point of view of active infectino
   -WIll continue with Vanco/Zosyn/Gent for treatment of what may well be
   ventilator associated pneumonia
   -Blood pressure has shown reasonable stability over time

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation support. 

From the review of systems, the patient has fatigue, tachypnea (rapid breathing), and anemia. The vital signs show a low blood pressure, decreased heart rate, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals distant S2 heart sound and diminished breath sounds in the respiratory system. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a normal pH, increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and adequate oxygenation.

The assessment and plan mention that the patient is experiencing persistent ventilatory failure, which is primarily due to significant dead space ventilation. The possibility of a pleural effusion contributing to this issue is also raised. The patient will continue with assisted-controlled (A/C) support with pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials, and a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) will be performed tomorrow. Prolonged weaning approach with intermittent need for ventilatory support is expected.

The patient has been stabilized from the point of view of active infection, and treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia will continue with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include impaired skin integrity, peripheral ed"

The patient has been receiving various medications and infusions, including dopamine, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and others. They have also been given different antibiotics. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,329 mL and output of 1,080 mL through the total in and out respectively. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 30.3 mmHg. 

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 277 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), troponin-T, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate. The patient also has low levels of potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), calcium (Ca++), albumin, and hemoglobin. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase) are also within normal range. 

The patient's care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ dysfunctions and ongoing medical complications. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory function, and laboratory values to guide further management."

   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema.
   Now off pressors, but with  pyuria, and GNR in sputum.
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission, and is
   now volume overloaded. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
   far.  Now pt. may have VAP as sputum is growing GNRs, awaiting
   speciation.  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of
   decreased of all of these factors.  Pt has now failed re-intubation
   twice.
   - Cont. gent & zosyn for presumed VAP until speciation available.
   - Cont. Vanco for MRSA started on evening of [**11-10**].
   -Trach & PEG on [**11-22**], NPO after midnight for procedure
   -Continue on PSV as tolerated.
   - diurese as permitted by BP
   # Hypotension:  Initially likely hypotension is due to urosepsis vs
   sepsis from pna.  Was initially responsive to fluid boluses; pt
   received 4L NS overnight from [**Date range (1) 6504**] with good urine output but
   throughout the day on the 15th was persistently hypotensive.  This was
   at first assumed to be [**2-4**] sedation administered during re-intubation,
   but hypotension persisted, requiring dopamine.   Of note, baseline BP
   seems to be low, and MAPs in 55-60 range still result in good urine
   output.  Cardiogenic causes also possible, as patient  has some
   electrophysiologic abnormalities, may be unable to mount sufficient
   increased cardiac output to deal with requirements.  EP feels that pt.
   is not a candidate for pacemaker given presumed sepsis.
   - treat infections as above
   - goal MAP>55 in pt with normal urine output
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever, hypotension,
   hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, treated with
   cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].  Sputum grew
   GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on gentamicin and
   Zosyn for VAP.   Vanco level this am not true trough.  Will recheck
   tomorrow.
   -Continue Vancomycin for MRSA
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn  started as described above
   -Check gentamicin peak and trough after 4^th dose.  Check vanco trough
   - Surveillance BCx
   - Remove IJ line.
   .
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Again, consider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP consult today to consider pacer placement to aid with hypotension.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now slightly
   hyponatremic.
   - decrease free water boluses to 100 q 6 hours
   # Paroxysmal afib

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. Currently, she is off pressors but has pyuria and gram-negative rods (GNRs) in sputum, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient also has respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia. There is a low NIF (negative inspiratory force) and CO2 retention after the latest extubation, indicating neuromuscular weakness. However, a persistent A-a gradient on the latest arterial blood gas (ABG) suggests intrinsic lung disease. The patient has pneumonia and possible obstructive disease given respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. She is now volume overloaded. No history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is mentioned, but it may be undiagnosed thus far. 

Other findings include hypotension, which initially seemed to be due to urosepsis versus sepsis from pneumonia. The patient responded to fluid boluses but remained persistently hypotensive throughout the day on the 15th, requiring dopamine. Baseline"

   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema. Now
   hypotensive.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology.  Lactate and mixed venous do not
   suggest infection.  Pt did not respond to fluid boluses and CVPs do not
   point to hypovolemia.  No history of cardiac failure, however no echos
   here so cardiogenic shock is possible.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be unable to mount HR
   response with conduction disorder.  EP consulted twice and do not want
   to intervene given her hx of sepsis.  Adrenal insufficiency also a
   possibility.  Autonomic instability possible after everything else
   ruled out.
   - obtain echo today for ?cardiogenic shock
   - wean dopamine as tolerated
   -AM cortisol to assess adrenal insufficiency
   - consider Midodrine if no answers obtained

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. She was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, and the etiology is unclear. Possible causes could include cardiogenic shock, adrenal insufficiency, autonomic instability, or sepsis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxia and hypercarbia, suggesting respiratory failure. This could be due to neuromuscular weakness, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, obstructive disease, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate management strategies should be implemented.

3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, characterized by fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. She has had multiple infections, including pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis in the urine, MRSA in the sputum, and GNRs likely indicating VAP. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored to target these organisms.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female with persistent respiratory failure and now with
   intermittent hypotension noted yesterday.  She has now had evolution of
   significant hypotension over the course of yesterday.  This has
   required Dopamine start for support of blood pressure and has had rapid
   stabilization.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with radiographic impression of improving
   pulmonary edema.  She maintains a stable respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation.
   -Trach today
   -Continue to support with PSV and move to rapid wean to trach mask
   trial with trach in place
   -Continue with GNR treatment and will refine based on findings on
   culture results and ID and Sensitivities
   2)Hypotension-This is a likely combination of diruesis, matched poorly
   with persistent bradycardia and with requirement for intermittent
   pressor support.  There is a concern for possible autonomic instability
   in that the paroxysms of hypotension do not have clear trigger or
   significant persistent insult.
   -Check cultures
   -Check ECG-
   -CXR ressuring
   -Will check ECHO for definition of baseline cardiac function

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with persistent respiratory failure and intermittent hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a endotracheal tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/43 mmHg to 78/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of tracheostomy planned, and it was performed today. She also has a history of hypotension requiring dopamine support for blood pressure. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin at 8.4 g/dL, sodium at 135 mg/dL, potassium at 4.1 mEq/L, creatinine at 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose at 81 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas values indicate respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.

Imaging shows improved bilateral pulmonary edema and effusions. Microbiology results reveal the presence of Gram-negative rods in the sputum culture.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient maintains stable respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. The plan includes performing a tracheost"

   hypotension or bradycardia.  Autonomic instability is possible.
   - checking am cortisol today to assess adrenal insufficiency.
   - consider midodrine if cortisol wnl
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Now pt. may have VAP as
   sputum is growing GNRs, awaiting speciation.  Difficulty of weaning
   from the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these factors.  Pt
   has now failed re-intubation twice.
   - Cont. gent & zosyn for presumed VAP until speciation available.
   - Cont. Vanco for MRSA started on evening of [**11-10**].
   -Trach & PEG today, restart tube feeds in 24 hours
   -Continue on PSV as tolerated.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. She also underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypotension: The patient had intermittent hypotension, which has since resolved. The cause of hypotension could be due to autonomic instability, adrenal insufficiency, or sepsis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced hypoxia and hypercarbia, suggesting respiratory failure. This could be due to neuromuscular weakness, pneumonia, obstructive lung disease, or a combination of these factors. The patient also has a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with sputum growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs).

3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis symptoms, including fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine cultures grew Proteus mirabilis, and the patient was treated with"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema. Now
   hypotensive.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology.  Lactate and mixed venous do not
   suggest infection.  Pt did not respond to fluid boluses and CVPs do not
   point to hypovolemia.  No history of cardiac failure, however no echos
   here so cardiogenic shock is possible.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be unable to mount HR
   response with conduction disorder.  EP consulted twice and do not want
   to intervene given her hx of sepsis.  Adrenal insufficiency also a
   possibility.  Autonomic instability possible after everything else
   ruled out.
   - obtain echo today for ?cardiogenic shock
   - wean dopamine as tolerated
   -AM cortisol to assess adrenal insufficiency
   - consider Midodrine if no answers obtained
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Now pt. may have VAP as
   sputum is growing GNRs, awaiting speciation.  Difficulty of weaning
   from the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these factors.  Pt
   has now failed re-intubation twice.
   - Cont. gent & zosyn for presumed VAP until speciation available.
   - Cont. Vanco for MRSA started on evening of [**11-10**].
   -Trach & PEG today, restart tube feeds in 24 hours
   -Continue on PSV as tolerated.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever, hypotension,
   hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, treated with
   cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].  Sputum grew
   GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on gentamicin and
   Zosyn for VAP.
   -Continue Vancomycin for MRSA
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn  started as described above
   - Surveillance BCx
   .
   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.
   - Will speak to family in order to outline pt
s baseline mental status
   once patient has tracheostomy and can better communicate.
   - Csider imaging if no improvement toward baseline.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP consult today to consider pacer placement to aid with hypotension.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) who presents with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient has been intubated twice for worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. She is currently hypotensive and shows signs of respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, especially considering the lack of history of cardiac failure. An echo has been ordered to further evaluate this possibility.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension and lack of response to fluid boluses raise the possibility of adrenal insufficiency. An AM cortisol has been ordered to assess this condition.

3. Autonomic instability: After ruling out other causes, autonomic instability could be a possibility. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and hypercarbia suggest respiratory failure. This could be due to intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Sputum is growing GNRs, indicating a bacterial infection, and appropriate antibiotics have been started.

   hypotension or bradycardia.  Autonomic instability is possible.
   - checking am cortisol today to assess adrenal insufficiency.
   - consider midodrine if cortisol wnl
   # Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Now pt. may have VAP as
   sputum is growing GNRs, still awaiting speciation.  Difficulty of
   weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these
   factors.  Trach & peg placed yesterday.
   - Cont. gent & zosyn for presumed VAP until speciation available.
   - Cont. Vanco for MRSA started on evening of [**11-10**].
   - Trach mask trial this afternoon if tolerated by patient.
   - Continue to wean from vent as tolerated.

   # Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever, hypotension,
   hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, treated with
   cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].  Sputum grew
   GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c

   # AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.  AMS may also be related to prolonged ICU
   stay.
   - Transition patient out of ICU
   - Consider imaging if MS worsens.

   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has had intermittent hypotension, which has now been resolved. The cause of the hypotension is unclear, but it may be related to autonomic instability or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed, including checking am cortisol levels to assess adrenal insufficiency.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced hypoxia and hypercarbia, suggesting respiratory failure. This could be due to neuromuscular weakness or intrinsic lung disease. The patient has pneumonia and possible obstructive disease, which may contribute to the respiratory failure. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as the sputum is growing Gram-negative rods. 

3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, characterized by fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. The urine grew out pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema. With
   intermittent hypotension now resolved, and now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.
   #1 Hypotension: Resolved currently.  Dopamine drip weaned off.  ECHO
   relatively unremarkable given patient
s age and does not explain
   hypotension or bradycardia.  Autonomic instability is possible.  AM
   cortisol normal.  A-line pulled.
   #2 Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Sputum growing
   stenotrophomonas, sensitive to Bactrim.   Difficulty of weaning from
   the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these factors.  Trach &
   peg placed yesterday.
   - IV bactrim 5mg/kg (250mg Q8h) x 8 days (today is day [**1-10**]
 last dose
   on [**12-1**])
   - d/c gent & zosyn for presumed VAP as stenotrophomonas sensitive to
   bactrim
   - Finish Vanco for MRSA in sputum started on evening of [**11-10**] (has had
   15 days of vancomycin total).
   - Continue to wean from vent as tolerated.
   .
   #3 Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever,
   hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis,
   treated with cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].
   Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on
   gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   -Continue Vancomycin for MRSA
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn  started as described above
   - Surveillance BCx
   .
   #4 AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.  AMS may also be related to prolonged ICU
   stay.
   - Transition patient out of ICU
   - Consider imaging if MS worsens.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP re-evaluation
 no indication for pacer at this time.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Paroxysmal afib
   - Not an anticoagulation candidate as per admission records
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN: tolerating TF through PEG w/out residuals as per nurse.  Replete
   lytes prn.
   # Access: PICC line put in [**2198-11-22**].  RIJ removed.
   # Code: full code.  Discussed with patient
s son [**Name (NI) 6287**] who wants
everything done
 including reintubation if patient fails extubation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) who presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient initially required intubation due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. She was extubated and then re-intubated twice.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her current condition. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced intermittent hypotension, which has since resolved. Dopamine drip was weaned off, but there is a possibility of autonomic instability. Morning cortisol levels were normal, ruling out adrenal insufficiency as a cause for hypotension.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxia and hypercarbia, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Low NIF (negative inspiratory force) and CO2 retention after extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness, while persistent A-a gradient on the latest ABG suggests intrinsic lung disease. Pneumonia and possible obstructive disease may be contributing factors.

3. Sepsis: The patient presented with sepsis, characterized by fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. Urine grew out pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, and she was treated with ciprof"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female initially admitted with sepsis and now with prolonged
   course of respiratory failure and weaning of ventilatory support over
   an extended period of time to be facilitated by tracheostomy.  She has
   had encouraging stability off of pressors and likely represents
   resolution of sepsis.
   1)respiratory Failure-
   -Move to wean PSv as tolerated
   -Will take increased efforts at mobility and PT to work to restore lost
   motor strenth of respiratory system which in the setting of chronic
   obstructive [**Known lastname **] disease is primary barrier to liberation from
   mecahnical ventilation
   -Trach mask trial if possible.
   -Will add bactrim for new culture results
   2)Sepsis/Hypotension-
   -Resolved
   -Pressors weaned to off for >24 hours
   -Likley near euvolemic in regards to volume status
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -Continue to minimize any sedating medications
   -Will continue with mobilitzation and work to encourage active
   parcitipation in care.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema. With
   intermittent hypotension now resolved, and now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.
   #1 Hypotension: Resolved.  Dopamine drip weaned off.  ECHO relatively
   unremarkable given patient
s age and does not explain hypotension or
   bradycardia.  Autonomic instability is possible.  AM cortisol normal.
   A-line pulled.
   #2 Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Sputum growing
   stenotrophomonas, sensitive to Bactrim.   Difficulty of weaning from
   the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these factors.  Trach &
   peg placed yesterday.
   - IV bactrim 5mg/kg (250mg Q8h) x 8 days (today is day [**2-10**]
 last dose
   on [**12-1**])
   - d/c gent & zosyn for presumed VAP as stenotrophomonas sensitive to
   bactrim
   - Stop Vanco for MRSA in sputum started on evening of [**11-10**] (has had 15
   days of vancomycin total).
   - Continue to wean from vent as tolerated.
   .
   #3 Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever,
   hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis,
   treated with cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].
   Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on
   gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   - d/c vanco
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn d/c as described above
   .
   #4 AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.  AMS may also be related to prolonged ICU
   stay.
   - Transition patient out of ICU
   - Consider imaging if MS worsens.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP re-evaluation
 no indication for pacer at this time.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Paroxysmal afib
   - Not an anticoagulation candidate as per admission records? To be
   further evaluated at extended

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) who presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. She was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. The patient now has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. She continues to experience respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia, and her sputum is growing Stenotrophomonas, which is sensitive to Bactrim. The patient also has sepsis with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia, and her urine culture grew Proteus mirabilis, treated with ciprofloxacin. Her sputum also grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and gram-negative rods (GNRs), likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is being treated with gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP and vancomycin for MRSA. The patient's mental status may be related to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy or underlying dementia, and imaging may be considered if her mental status worsens. She has a history of bradycardia, which could be a variation of"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema. With
   intermittent hypotension now resolved, and now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.
   #1 Hypotension: Resolved.  Dopamine drip weaned off.  ECHO relatively
   unremarkable given patient
s age and does not explain hypotension or
   bradycardia.  Autonomic instability is possible.  AM cortisol normal.
   A-line pulled.
   #2 Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Sputum growing
   stenotrophomonas, sensitive to Bactrim.   Difficulty of weaning from
   the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these factors.  Trach &
   peg placed yesterday.
   - IV bactrim 5mg/kg (250mg Q8h) x 8 days (today is day [**2-10**]
 last dose
   on [**12-1**])
   - d/c gent & zosyn for presumed VAP as stenotrophomonas sensitive to
   bactrim
   - Stop Vanco for MRSA in sputum started on evening of [**11-10**] (has had 15
   days of vancomycin total).
   - Continue to wean from vent as tolerated.
   .
   #3 Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever,
   hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis,
   treated with cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].
   Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on
   gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   - d/c vanco
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn d/c as described above
   .
   #4 AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.  AMS may also be related to prolonged ICU
   stay.
   - Transition patient out of ICU
   - Consider imaging if MS worsens.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP re-evaluation
 no indication for pacer at this time.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Paroxysmal afib
   - Not an anticoagulation candidate as per admission records? To be
   further evaluated at extended

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and then re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. Her intermittent hypotension has resolved, and she underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, respiratory failure, sepsis, AMS, and bradycardia. Her respiratory failure is attributed to hypoxia and hypercarbia, with a persistent A-a gradient suggesting intrinsic lung disease. The patient has pneumonia and possible obstructive disease, which may have been undiagnosed until now. She is sensitive to Bactrim for stenotrophomonas.

The patient's sepsis was initially treated with ciprofloxacin for proteus mirabilis and vancomycin for MRSA. However, her sputum grew GNRs, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which she was started on gentamicin and Zosyn. Vancomycin was discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He has been receiving various antibiotics and other ICU medications, including heparin for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 131/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. His weight has increased from 49.5 kg at admission to 72 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,015 mL and a total output of 1,063 mL. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 290 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient is also experiencing diarrhea, altered mental status, peripheral edema, and renal failure. He is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and has a PICC line in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of sepsis and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of acquiring new infections or experiencing complications related to existing infections.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although the patient's current respiratory status is stable, there is a risk of developing ARDS due to his underlying condition and the use of mechanical"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema. With
   intermittent hypotension now resolved, and now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.
   #1 Hypotension: Resolved.  Dopamine drip weaned off.  ECHO relatively
   unremarkable given patient
s age and does not explain hypotension or
   bradycardia.  Autonomic instability is possible.  AM cortisol normal.
   A-line pulled.
   #2 Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Sputum growing
   stenotrophomonas, sensitive to Bactrim.   Difficulty of weaning from
   the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these factors.  Trach &
   peg placed yesterday.
   - IV bactrim 5mg/kg (250mg Q8h) x 8 days (today is day [**2-10**]
 last dose
   on [**12-1**])
   - d/c gent & zosyn for presumed VAP as stenotrophomonas sensitive to
   bactrim
   - Stop Vanco for MRSA in sputum started on evening of [**11-10**] (has had 15
   days of vancomycin total).
   - Continue to wean from vent as tolerated.
   .
   #3 Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever,
   hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis,
   treated with cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].
   Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on
   gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   - d/c vanco
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn d/c as described above
   .
   #4 AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.  AMS may also be related to prolonged ICU
   stay.
   - Transition patient out of ICU
   - Consider imaging if MS worsens.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP re-evaluation
 no indication for pacer at this time.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and then re-intubated twice due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. Her intermittent hypotension has been resolved, and she has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's current conditions and plans include:
1. Hypotension: Resolved. Dopamine drip weaned off. Echocardiogram (echo) relatively unremarkable given the patient's age and does not explain hypotension or bradycardia. Autonomic instability is possible. AM cortisol normal. A-line pulled.
2. Respiratory failure: Hypoxia and hypercarbia. Low NIF and CO2 retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness. However, persistent A-a gradient on latest arterial blood gas (ABG) suggests intrinsic lung disease. The patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COP"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema. With
   intermittent hypotension now resolved, and now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.
   #1 Hypotension: Resolved currently.  Dopamine drip weaned off.  ECHO
   relatively unremarkable given patient
s age and does not explain
   hypotension or bradycardia.  Autonomic instability is possible.  AM
   cortisol normal.  A-line pulled.
   #2 Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Sputum growing
   stenotrophomonas, sensitive to Bactrim.   Difficulty of weaning from
   the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these factors.  Trach &
   peg placed yesterday.
   - IV bactrim 5mg/kg (250mg Q8h) x 8 days (today is day [**1-10**]
 last dose
   on [**12-1**])
   - d/c gent & zosyn for presumed VAP as stenotrophomonas sensitive to
   bactrim
   - Finish Vanco for MRSA in sputum started on evening of [**11-10**] (has had
   15 days of vancomycin total).
   - Continue to wean from vent as tolerated.
   .
   #3 Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever,
   hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis,
   treated with cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].
   Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on
   gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   -Continue Vancomycin for MRSA
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn  started as described above
   - Surveillance BCx
   .
   #4 AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.  AMS may also be related to prolonged ICU
   stay.
   - Transition patient out of ICU
   - Consider imaging if MS worsens.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP re-evaluation
 no indication for pacer at this time.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Paroxysmal afib
   - Not an anticoagulation candidate as per admission records
   # Alzheimer's: cont home meds
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN: tolerating TF through PEG w/out residuals as per nurse.  Replete
   lytes prn.
   # Access: PICC line put in [**2198-11-22**].  RIJ removed.
   # Code: full code.  Discussed with patient
s son [**Name (NI) 6287**] who wants
everything done
 including reintubation if patient fails extubation.
   .
   # Dispo: appropriate for [**Hospital 6593**] rehab. Accepted by [**Hospital1 5450**] at [**Last Name (LF) 1817**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] go tomorrow am.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, urinary tract infection (UTI), and impressive hypernatremia. The patient was initially intubated, extubated, and re-intubated twice for worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. She also has pneumonia with sputum growing stenotrophomonas, which is sensitive to Bactrim. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including Piperacillin, Gentamicin, Vancomycin, and Bactrim.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has since resolved. However, there is a possibility of autonomic instability and further episodes of low blood pressure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure characterized by hypoxia and hypercarbia. It is likely due to a combination of factors such as neuromuscular weakness, pneumonia, and possible obstructive lung disease. Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement have been done to assist with breathing and nutrition.
3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which was initially treated with ciprofloxacin for proteus mirabilis and vancomycin for MRSA. Subsequently, she developed"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
   presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
   hypernatremia, initially intubated, extubated and re-intubated X 2 for
   worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, ? flash pulmonary edema. With
   intermittent hypotension now resolved, and now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.
   #1 Hypotension: Resolved.  Dopamine drip weaned off.  ECHO relatively
   unremarkable given patient
s age and does not explain hypotension or
   bradycardia.  Autonomic instability is possible.  AM cortisol normal.
   A-line pulled.
   #2 Respiratory failure: hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Low NIF and CO2
   retention after latest extubation suggest neuromuscular weakness.
   However, persistent A-a gradient on latest ABG suggests intrinsic [**Known lastname **]
   disease.  Patient has pneumonia, possible obstructive disease given
   respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at admission. No Hx of
   COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.  Sputum growing
   stenotrophomonas, sensitive to Bactrim.   Difficulty of weaning from
   the vent likely a mix of decreased of all of these factors.  Trach &
   peg placed yesterday.
   - IV bactrim 5mg/kg (250mg Q8h) x 8 days (today is day [**2-10**]
 last dose
   on [**12-1**])
   - d/c gent & zosyn for presumed VAP as stenotrophomonas sensitive to
   bactrim
   - Stop Vanco for MRSA in sputum started on evening of [**11-10**] (has had 15
   days of vancomycin total).
   - Continue to wean from vent as tolerated.
   .
   #3 Sepsis: Patient initially presented with sepsis - fever,
   hypotension, hypoxia.  Urine grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis,
   treated with cipro.  Sputum growing MRSA.  Vanco started pm [**11-10**].
   Sputum grew GNRs, likely VAP.  Cipro and Unasyn d/c
d, begun on
   gentamicin and Zosyn for VAP.
   - d/c vanco
   - Gentamicin and Zosyn d/c as described above
   .
   #4 AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies could
   include stroke, and underlying dementia.  During the interval time
   between extubation and re-intubation, her mental status appeared to the
   family to be near baseline.  AMS may also be related to prolonged ICU
   stay.
   - Transition patient out of ICU
   - Consider imaging if MS worsens.
   .
   # Bradycardia: not new
 old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree
   AV block 3 years ago.
   - Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal
   or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis
   and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
   -EP re-evaluation
 no indication for pacer at this time.
   -Tx hypotension fluids, then with dopamine or atropine
   # Paroxysmal afib
   - Not an anticoagulation candidate as per admission records? To be
   further evaluated at extended

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient initially presented with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. She was intubated, extubated, and re-intubated multiple times due to worsening acidosis, hypercarbia, and possible flash pulmonary edema. The patient also has pneumonia, possibly obstructive disease, and has been on various antibiotics including bactrim, gentamicin, and vancomycin.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension resolved, but there is a possibility of autonomic instability.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced hypoxia and hypercarbia. This could be due to neuromuscular weakness or intrinsic lung disease. The patient has pneumonia and possible obstructive disease, which may contribute to respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.
3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis symptoms including fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. The urine grew out pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis, treated with ciprofloxacin. Sputum grew MRSA and GNRs, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Antibiotics have been changed accordingly.
4. Altered mental status (AMS):"
