   # CORONARIES: Patient was reported to have elevated CEs at the OSH,
   however her CK here was normal and her trop was 0.03.  She has no
   history of chest pain, but does have severe PVD which makes the
   likelihood of CAD high.  She has had no previous catheterizations in

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block, and an ischemic right leg that underwent thrombectomy and angiogram. She experienced a small perforation during the procedure and is currently being monitored in the CCU for hematoma formation. The patient's anticoagulation with heparin has been reversed with protamine. She is stable with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 35.7%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma formation at the site of the arterial perforation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and presence of PVD.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE) as a potential complication of DVT.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias, considering her history of complete heart block and severe PVD which may indicate underlying coronary artery disease (CAD).
5. Infection due to invasive lines and procedures.
6. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest.
7. Respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Kidney injury or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy from angiogram.
9. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to atherosclerosis and embolic events.
10. Wound infection or non-healing at the site of thrombectomy."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block, and an ischemic right leg that underwent thrombectomy and angiogram. She has a small perforation in the distal peroneal artery and is currently being monitored for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome in the CCU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/52-166/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals faint heart sounds with regular rhythm, no jugular venous distention, and clear lungs. The patient has a steri-strip over her right upper chest where her pacemaker was placed, and she appears comfortable. Her right leg has a well-healing incision with staples, a large old bruise, and some tenderness. The left femoral area has a dressing with slight oozing of red blood. Sensation is intact in her right leg, and pulses are present. Multiple ecchymoses are noted on her arms.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose is within normal range, but creatinine levels are slightly elevated. Electrolyte"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block after pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg following thrombectomy and right lower extremity angiogram. She is currently being monitored in the CCU for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome.

The patient underwent a thrombectomy and right lower extremity angiogram, which resulted in a small perforation. Vascular surgery has been consulted, and her anticoagulation with heparin has been reversed with protamine. Her initial hematocrit (Hct) level is stable at 35. The patient denies any pain currently.

The plan includes active type and screen, trending Hct daily, monitoring for compartment syndrome, appreciating vascular surgery consult, and following recommended guidelines. The patient's calf circumference and peripheral pulses will be monitored every two hours, anticoagulation will be held off, and Plavix 75 mg will be continued daily.

The patient also has a history of demand ischemia, with elevated cardiac enzymes (CEs) reported at the outpatient surgery hospital (OSH), but with normal CK and troponin levels. She has no history of chest pain, but severe PVD is present, making the likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) high. The workup for possible CAD will be deferred to the primary floor Cardiology team or outpatient setting once her acute situation has resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 13471**] is a 85 year-old female with hypertension, PVD, complete
   block s/p pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg s/p
   thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation being
   monitored in the CCU for hematoma formation or possible compartment
   syndrome.
   # Ischemic R foot s/p thrombectomy and RLE angiogram with small
   performation:
   Vascular surgery has been consulted.  Her anticoagulation with heparin
   had been reversed with protamine.  Her initial Hct is stable at 35.
   She denies any pain currently.  Hct now stable at 30 but no worsening
   signs on exam, no signs of compartment syndrome.
   - Active type and screen.
   - trend Hct daily and monitor for compartment syndrome
   - Appreciate vascular surgery consult, will f/u recs.
   - Will monitor calf circumference and peripheral pulses q2h.
   - Hold off anticoagulation currently.
   - Continue plavix 75 mg po daily.
   # NSTEMI/Demand Ischemia:
   Patient was reported to have elevated CEs at the OSH, however her CK
   here was normal and her trop was 0.03.  She has no history of chest
   pain, but does have severe PVD which makes the likelihood of CAD high.
   She has had no previous catheterizations in our system.
   - Defer workup for possible CAD to primary floor Cardiology
   team/outpatient setting once her acute situation has resolved.
   - Will continue the B-blocker and ASA which was started here by the
   floor Cardiology team unless she has evidence of bleeding.
   # PUMP/Hypertension:  The patient appears euvolemic.
   - Continue home Amlodipine 5mg PO daily.
   - Will continue holding her home lasix for now.
   # RHYTHM: She had complete heart block s/p pacemaker placement.
   Admission EKG showed V-paced rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   # Tobacco use:
   - Smoking cessation counseling.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block post pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg post thrombectomy and right lower extremity angiogram. She is being monitored for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome.

2. The patient's initial hematocrit (Hct) level was stable at 35%, but it has now dropped to 30%. However, there are no worsening signs on examination, and there are no signs of compartment syndrome.

3. The patient's anticoagulation with heparin has been reversed with protamine. She is currently on Plavix 75 mg orally daily. The plan is to trend Hct daily and monitor for compartment syndrome. Vascular surgery consultation has been appreciated, and recommendations will be followed up.

4. The patient has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, which increases the likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, she has had no previous catheterizations in our system. The plan is to defer workup for possible CAD to primary floor Cardiology team/outpatient setting once her acute situation has resolved.

5. The patient's medication includes continuing the beta-blocker and aspirin unless she shows evidence of bleeding.

6. The patient appears euvolemic and has hypertension. The plan is to continue home A"
