   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 y/o M with preseptal cellulitis and likely pneumonia
   .
   # Resp Distress: Most likely external compression from infection
   - intubated for airway protection
   - continue PS with minimal sedation for now
   - routine vent care
   -f/u ABG
   .
   # Preseptal cellulitis: Most common pathogens for this pt are strep and
   staph, and anaerobes. He is not immunocompromised and less concern for
   fungal etiologies. Finally, given spread over last hour there is also
   concern for clostridium as well
   - low threshhold to repeat CT scan to eval for abscess, but would
   prefer CT with contrast if renal failure improves
   - erythromycin over the skin
   - nasal decongestants PRN
   - head of bed elevated, greater than 45%, cold gauze
   - change ABX to ceftaz, flagyl, linezolid
   - will hold on further clinda for now (did receive one dose)
   - get non-contrast maxillofacial CT
   -trend lactate, McvO2
   - d/w ID re: narrowing coverage
   -Trasfuse 2 U FFP in seting of possible OR
   .
   # PNA: Based on fever, infiltrate on CXR and cough, there is also
   suspicion for pneumonia. per wife, he has never had any aspiration
   events. I am more concerned for CAP
   - Continue abx as per above
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs PRN
   -Follow cx
   .-urine legionella
   # ARF: baseline 1.0 now 1.9. I suspect prerenal azotemia at this point
   given hx and exam, Urine lytes pre renal
   - renally dose meds
   - send urine lytes
   - trend cre
   .
   # Traumatic foley: replaced on admission night and bladder irrigated
   - continue bladder irrigation overnight
   .
   # Lethargy: I suspect a combination of infection and old CVA. No neck
   stiffness/meningeal signs
   - continue to monitor and w/u infectious etiologies
   .
   # Hypertension: Normally BP runs high, but tonight has been lower in
   low 100's. Given concern for progressing infection, will hold off on BP
   meds
   - hold Toprol, nifedipine, and lisinopril for now
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access:
   - peripherals X 2
   - d/w attd regarding CVL; however, given site of infection hesitant to

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with preseptal cellulitis, likely pneumonia, and a history of CVA. He is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, but he is hemodynamically stable. Laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels, electrolyte imbalances, and leukocytosis. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including coverage for anaerobes, and will have his ABG repeated. Imaging studies, such as a non-contrast maxillofacial CT and follow-up chest X-ray, are planned. The patient's medical team is concerned about the spread of infection and the possibility of complications like necrotizing fasciitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing Fasciitis: The presence of spread infection and concern for Clostridium raises the possibility of necrotizing fasciitis, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate surgical intervention.
2. Abscess: There is a concern for the development of an abscess, which could be evaluated through repeat CT scans.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of hypotension suggest the possibility of AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate measures, such as fluid resuscitation and medication dose adjustments, are necessary.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with preseptal cellulitis, likely pneumonia, and respiratory distress. He was intubated for airway protection. The primary pathogens suspected for the cellulitis are strep, staph, and anaerobes. There is also a concern for Clostridium. Antibiotics have been changed to cover these organisms. The patient's renal function has deteriorated from baseline, and there is a suspicion of prerenal azotemia. Foley catheter was replaced due to traumatic placement. The patient is lethargic, possibly due to infection and old cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Blood pressure medications have been withheld. The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."
