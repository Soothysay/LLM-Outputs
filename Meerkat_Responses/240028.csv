   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of Alzheimer's disease, chronic heart failure, hypertension, non-progressive hydrocephalus, and penile cancer. He was admitted with likely septic shock of urinary origin and is currently intubated in the intensive care unit (ICU). 

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever (101.3 F), normal heart rate (64 bpm), low blood pressure (88/74 mmHg), normal respiratory rate (14 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2%) ranging from 98-98, and fluid balance with an intake of 1,505 mL and output of 405 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 348 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) at 20 mL/min.

The patient's laboratory results reveal leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 24.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.4 mg/dL, low platelet count (Plt) of 161 K/uL, elevated troponin-T level of 0.07 ng/mL, and elevated lactate level of 2.8 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, intubation, sedation, normocephalic head, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and no extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows no attentiveness, inability to follow simple commands, and unassessed movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes.

The patient's assessment and plan include several medical conditions, including heart failure (CHF), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute respiratory failure, fever, cancer (malignant neoplasm), coronary artery disease (CAD), electrolyte and fluid disorder, and dementia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening of heart failure, development of septic shock, progression of urinary tract infection, failure to wean off mechanical ventilation, and worsening of respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo with CAD, Alzheimer
s dementia, multiple UTIs in the past, p/w
   UTI and sepsis, hypoxia, and renal failure; intubated in ED with
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Presumed source is urine, given grossly positive UA. CVP
   currently 9. Lactate of 3.7 likely [**1-24**] poor end organ perfusion.
   Chronic foley catheter has been replaced. Lactate downtrending.
   - IV fluid boluses to keep MAP>60 until CVP>12 prn
   - Weaned off levophed
   - Vancomycin, Zosyn for GU coverage as well as potential pneumonia;
   re-dose Vancomycin
   - Follow up cultures: blood, urine
   - Follow up CXR
   .
   #. Hypoxia:  Improved. Differential includes healthcare associated
   pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, H1N1, but more likely ARDS in the
   setting of urosepsis. Patient does not appear volume overloaded.
   Intubated given tachypnea and s/p extubation today.
   - Follow up CXR; obtain CXR in AM
   - Follow up sputum culture
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Cr 1.1 today and improving. Baseline per OMR
   appears to be 0.9, though he has CRI listed as a problem. Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis.
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - IVF prn
   - Continue to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from lactic acidosis in the
   setting of poor end organ perfusion. Resolved at this time.
   .
   #. Alzheimers dementia: Chair bound. Will speak with family regarding
   baseline functioning and goals of care.
   .
   #. HTN: Hold Atenolol and Finasteride
   .
   #. CAD: Continue ASA 81mg. Hold BB. Continue statin.
   .
   # FEN: IVFs, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIVx2, R IJ, A-line
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 203**] [**Name (NI) 10487**] (wife) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10488**]
   # Code:  Full - patient demented, but paperwork from rehab confirms
   full code.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; will likely stay in
   ICU today and may perhaps go to the floor tomorrow.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), Alzheimer's dementia, and multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the past. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and was intubated. The patient is currently being treated for sepsis presumed to be secondary to a urinary tract infection, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. His lactate levels indicate poor end-organ perfusion, but they are currently trending down. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and is receiving supplemental oxygen. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 64. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 328, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is awake, alert, and oriented with clear lungs bilaterally. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is described as obese, non-tender, and soft. Foley catheterization has been performed, and his urine output has been monitored.

He was admitted to the emergency department with respiratory distress and subsequently intubated. He is currently in the ICU with the following assessments and plans:

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: Presumed source is urine, given grossly positive urinalysis (UA). Central venous pressure (CVP) currently at 9, and lactate of 3.7 likely indicates poor end organ perfusion. Chronic foley catheter has been replaced.
- IV fluid boluses to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 until CVP >12
- Consider levophed once CVP >12 to maintain MAP >60, urine output (UO) >50cc/hour
- Abs: Vanc, Zosyn for GU coverage, but also potential pneumonia coverage
- Follow-up blood cultures
- Follow-up urine culture
- Repeat chest X-ray (CXR) in the morning
- Recheck lactate in the morning

2. Hypoxia: Differential includes healthcare associated pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, H1N1, but more likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of urosepsis. Patient does not appear volume overloaded. Intubated given tachypnea.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of Alzheimer's disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), non-progressive hydrocephalus (NPH), and penile cancer. He was admitted with suspected septic shock of urinary origin and respiratory distress, for which he was intubated in the emergency department. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is being treated for several conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient had septic shock caused by Enterococcus in the urine and GNRs in the blood. His creatinine levels are improving, and he no longer requires pressors. Antibiotic coverage is being narrowed to vancomycin and Zosyn.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure but has since been successfully extubated and is doing well.

3. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic CHF, which may contribute to his current critical condition.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a urinary tract infection, likely contributing to the septic shock.

5. Cancer: The patient has a history of penile cancer, which could potentially lead to complications related to malignancy.

6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications.

7. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), Alzheimer's dementia, and multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the past. He presented to the emergency department with chills, hypoxia, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and piperacillin. He is currently receiving IV fluids, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Vital signs show stable pressures, a declining white blood cell count, and a decreasing lactate level. The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine level of 0.9 today. His oxygen requirement is improving, but the etiology of his hypoxia is unclear. A chest X-ray (CXR) has been ordered to further evaluate his condition.

The patient's medical history includes Alzheimer's dementia, hypertension (HTN), and CAD. He is currently chair-bound and speaks with some difficulty. His family has been consulted regarding his baseline functioning and goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to an infection"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's disease, chronic heart failure (CHF), hypertension, non-progressive hydrocephalus (NPH), and penile cancer. He was admitted with likely septic shock of urinary origin and required intubation in the emergency department due to respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/62 to 158/134 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is currently extubated and doing well.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's initial condition involved septic shock of urinary origin. Continued administration of antibiotics such as vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) is necessary to treat the infection and prevent further complications.

2. Heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic CHF. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is essential to prevent exacerbation of heart failure.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): As the patient's initial presentation was likely due to a urinary source, it is important to continue monitoring for signs of UTI and treat it promptly to avoid complications such as sepsis.

4. Respiratory failure: Although the patient was successfully extubated and is"
