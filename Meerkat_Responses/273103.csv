   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be pulm or urine. He has very psoitive
   U/A. Of note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in
   recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, lungs sound mostly clear, although he
   is total body volume overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - consider repeat echo
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic and chronic foley
   - treatment as above
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - would stop Flagyl as c. diff toxin a and B negative on [**12-16**]
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - telemetry until ROMI with CE x 3
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.5 which is mostly likely prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: I suspect hypernatremia is from excess free water loss
   from fever, insensible losses.
   - send urine lytes
   - gentle free water replacement (he has a 3.7L deficit)
   - D5W at 75 cc/hr
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor
   - would care consult
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - Low sodium dysphagia diet with ensure pudding
   - Boost puddings 6 per day
   - Elevate scrotum and lower extremities to decrease anasarca
   - Aspiration precautions
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
   # ACCESS
   - fem line

   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be pulm or urine. He has very psoitive
   U/A. Of note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in
   recent past

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), previous myocardial infarction (MCA CVA), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents with hypotension and respiratory distress from a rehabilitation facility. The patient has leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension, which is concerning for sepsis. His urine analysis shows a positive result, suggesting a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has anemia, hypernatremia, alkalosis, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's leukocytosis, fever, and positive urine analysis, there is a risk of sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not treated promptly.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF and current symptoms may worsen, leading to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The positive urine analysis indicates a UTI, which can potentially progress to pyelonephritis or lead to kidney dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - see above for nutrition plans
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (EF 45%), previous myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents from a rehabilitation center with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension, suggesting sepsis, possibly from a urinary tract infection (UTI). His urine analysis shows numerous unusual organisms. The patient is currently on low-dose neo, IV fluids, and antibiotics for the UTI. His blood culture is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension indicates a possible ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. UTI: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms. This current infection may have progressed to a severe UTI or pyelonephritis, requiring aggressive treatment.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and management, including IV fluids and vasopressor support if necessary.
4. CHF: The patient has a history of systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%. His current respiratory distress and hypotension could be related to worsening heart failure.
5. ARF: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's family has not yet made a decision regarding DNR/DNI status or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient underwent a urology consultation and a scrotal ultrasound, which showed significant subcutaneous scrotal swelling without hypervascularity or gas within the tissues. The edema may be due to third spacing, and further evaluation is recommended to exclude a subcutaneous infectious process.

The patient has allergies to Norvasc (amlodipine besylate) and Cipro I.V. (ciprofloxacin lactate), with hives and rash as previous reactions. The patient received antibiotics including Vancomycin, Tobramycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient is currently receiving infusions of phenylephrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min and morphine sulfate. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the below noted events.

Flowsheet data as of [2100-12-31] 07:01 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate of 68 bpm (67-87), blood pressure ranging from 100/56 mmHg to 122/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (7-24), and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced.

The patient's weight is currently 76.1 kg, with a total input of 1,494 mL of fluids and output of 611 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has not received blood products or respiratory support.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic examination not assessed, and other assessments not documented.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count at 17.4 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin at 9.2 g/dL, normal glucose levels ranging from 74 to 117 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen at 28 mEq/L, normal creatinine levels ranging from 1.4 to 1.5 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, pain control (acute and chronic pain), impaired skin integrity, hypovolemia without shock, and septic shock. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line placed on [2100-12-30] at 06:00 PM. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of
   note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean, very low dose, able to wean some
   yesterday, but required a lot of IVFs
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx, added tobramycin for better GN
   coverage
   - f/u blood, urine cx - NGTD
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology, called urology today for eval,
   will f/u recs
 possible suprapubic cath
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - need to discuss long term nutrition plans with family, may need PEG
   for nutrition, as likely not able to keep fluid intravascularly due to
   his low albumin
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (EF 45%), previous myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents from rehabilitation with hypotension and respiratory distress. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on mechanical ventilation support. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.4 K/uL, elevated troponin level of 0.25, and kidney dysfunction with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient is suspected to have hypovolemia versus septic shock. He has had poor oral intake since returning to the nursing home, which raises concerns for sepsis. The most likely source of infection is the urinary tract, considering the positive urinalysis and previous growth of unusual organisms from urine. 

   - Goal MAP > 65, CVP 10-12, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to culture results
   - Add tobramycin for better coverage of gram-negative"

   - urology c/s done, no suprapubic or CBI
   - scotral u/s done: Significant subcutaneous scrotal swelling with no
   hypervascularity and no gas within the tissues identified. This edema
   may be due to third spacing but ultrasound is unable to further
   characterize. A clinical evaluation is recommended to exclude a
   subcutaneous infectious process, and if further imaging is required, a

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension, which is concerning for sepsis. He also has an EF of 45% and positive urine analysis (U/A) with unusual organisms. The patient's condition is complicated by chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypernatremia, contraction alkalosis, non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein, and a history of right deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple medical complications including UTI, CHF, pain management, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, acute renal failure (ARF), hypernatremia, alkalosis, venous clots, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, anemia, pressure ulcer, sacral/buttock rash, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension raises concern for sepsis, particularly given the positive U/A and unusual organisms.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - off pressors now
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - continue abx  for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 psuedomonas and >100,000 GNR #2
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with tobra and zosyn; stopped vanco
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Hypernatermia
 replace with D5W
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding.
   - no peg tube, decided to eat for comfort
   .
   # Pain
 much more comfortable
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI, cont above tx
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 probably at
   new baseline
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi due to low BP
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - starting feeds despite aspiration risk
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis (INR seemed to have
   peaked)
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has been NPO since admission due to aspiration risk and is currently being fed for comfort.

The patient has leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension, which are concerning for sepsis. The most likely source of infection is the urine, with numerous unusual organisms grown from recent urine cultures. The patient also has a large bladder diverticulum with a possible fungus ball in the bladder and chronic Foley catheter.

The patient is hypernatremic and needs replacement with D5W. He is not receiving enteral nutrition at this time but has been fed for comfort. Pain management is being provided with low-dose morphine. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, suggesting myocardial injury, and his creatinine is at baseline.

The patient has chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of 1.2, now trending downward. He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic vein, which is associated with a previous PICC line placement, and a history of right deep vein thrombosis with inferior vena cava filter in place.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuating vital signs and dependence on pressors for blood pressure support. The patient's family has decided to make him DNR/DNI and is choosing to provide comfort care rather than pursuing aggressive interventions like PEG/TPN. The patient's allergies include Norvasc and Cipro IV, with a history of hives and rash associated with Cipro. The patient is currently receiving various medications in the ICU, including famotidine, morphine sulfate, and other medications as per the treatment plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient has demonstrated signs of volume depletion, which can lead to hypotension and inadequate organ perfusion if not managed appropriately.
3. Septic shock: The patient's vital signs have been unstable, and there may be concerns about potential sepsis or septic shock, especially given the elevated white blood cell count and other laboratory abnormalities.
4. Acute pain: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed effectively to ensure comfort and prevent further complications.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition status is a concern, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - see above for nutrition plans
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (EF 45%), previous middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents from rehabilitation with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk. He is currently on low-dose neo (likely referring to an antibiotic), IV fluids as needed, and pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient is also receiving triple antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with unusual organisms, including gram-negative rods. He has a large bladder diverticulum with a possible fungus ball and chronic foley catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia or septic shock. Given the presence of leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension, sepsis is a concern. The most likely source of infection seems to be the urine, possibly due to a UTI with unusual organisms.
2. UTI: The patient has a frequent history of UTIs with unusual organisms. His large bladder diverticulum and chronic foley catheter increase the risk of infection.
3. CHF: The patient has a history of systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%. His intravascular volume status is dry,"

   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .

   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable

   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow

   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 45%), prior myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient presents from rehabilitation with hypotension and respiratory distress. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions:

1. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or septic shock. Poor oral intake and the presence of leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension suggest sepsis. The most likely source of infection is a urinary tract infection (UTI), indicated by positive urinalysis and recent growth of unusual organisms from urine.

2. UTI: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms. A large bladder diverticulum with a possible fungus ball in the bladder and chronic Foley catheter are contributing factors. Treatment includes triple antibiotic therapy, and a decision has been made not to pursue suprapubic catheter or clean intermittent catheterization at this time.

3. CHF: The patient's ejection fraction is 45%, indicating systolic congestive heart failure. He is intravascularly dry but extravascularly overloaded. Gentle intravenous fluid administration will be monitored to avoid exacerbating heart failure. Lasix is temporarily withheld due to the use of pressors.

4. Elevated"
