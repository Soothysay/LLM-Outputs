   Mr. [**Known lastname 5613**] is a 67 y.o. male w/pmh alcoholism admitted [**1-23**] with
   septic shock [**12-18**] salmonella sepsis and pancolitis with course
   complicated by ARF, hepatitis, pancolitis and desquamating drug rash,
   transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, leukocytosis and fever likely
   [**12-18**] acute clostridium difficile infection.
   .
   #C. diff septic shock: Admitted to MICU with fever, leukocytosis and
   tachycardia, requiring pressors.  Also with evidence of end organ
   ischemia.  Stool cx from [**2-20**] confirmed C. diff, has copious stool
   production.  Likely contracted from prolonged hospitalization and
   recent antiibotic use.  Abdominal exam relatively benign with no
   rebound or guarding.  Blood and urine cx NGTD.  Will require aggressive
   care and careful watching for complications.  Lactate trending down,
   WBC trending down
   - Appreciate ID recs: will cont PO vanco, IV flagyl
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - Appreciate surgery consult: monitor lactate, cont antbx
   - Hold CT imaging for now given continued clinical improvement
   - KUB with slight worsening, though clinically unchanged -> cont to

   - IVF boluses for CVP 10-12, has high output given DI,
   -wean levophed
   - LENIs neg for DVT
   - CVL RIJ placed [**2-21**], R A line placed [**2-21**]
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine peaked at 5.2 during his admission
   likely [**12-18**] sepsis and hypotension and rhabdomyolysis on admission, has
   been slowly trending down, at 1.5 on transfer to ICU.  Stable through
   current Cdiff sepsis at 1.4
   -monitor Cr
   - volum resucsitation as above
   # Diabetes Insipidus: Per patient has a history of having to ""drink
   lots of water"" which he was told was due to 13 years of taking
   lithium.  Was significantly volume deplete in setting of DI and acitve
   volume loss from c.diff and diarrhea.  Urine osm of 204 on admission
   supports this.
   - Volume resuscitation with NS, LR
   - monitor Na closely as will be prone to hypernatremia
   - allow pt to drink water in order to replace free water losses
   .
   # Hepatitis, pancreatitis:  Thought likely [**12-18**] drug reaction, ? zosyn
   vs depakote.  Has been followed by liver service previously, with
   cholestatic picture.  LFT's and PFT's continue to slowly trend down,
   with no evidence that worsening of liver function is contributing to
   his current picture.
   - monitor LFT's, amylase, lipase
   - avoid zosyn/depakote
   .
   # Salmonella Sepsis, pancolitis on admission: Has finished course of
   treatment for salmonella sepis with resolving pancolitis per serial
   abdominal CT's.
   .
   # AGEP (acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis -> diffuse
   desquamating drug rash thought most likely [**12-18**] cephalosporins or
   vancomycin.  Resolving since these abx d/c'd [**2-4**].
   - Triamcinolone 0.1% cream daily to rash (this may help with tenderness
   and pruritus from rash
   - Spoke with dermatology: AGEP likely caused by B lactam.  Ok to cont

   - Stop PO vanco if rash returns
   .
   # Anemia: Has been stable in the low 20's since admission, likely [**12-18**]
   prolonged illness.  No evidence of acute blood loss.  Required
   transfusion 2 units on admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, admitted on [**1-23**] with septic shock, salmonella sepsis, and pancolitis. He has had a complicated course including acute renal failure, hepatitis, pancreatitis, desquamating drug rash, and now suspected C. diff septic shock. He is currently in the ICU for tachycardia, leukocytosis, and fever. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including diabetes insipidus, hepatitis, pancreatitis, anemia, and a history of seizure disorder and renal mass. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff septic shock: The patient is already showing signs of this condition, including fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and evidence of end organ ischemia. Aggressive care and careful monitoring for complications are necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels peaked at 5.2 during admission and have been trending down. Continued monitoring of renal function is essential.
3. Diabetes Insipidus: The patient has a history of this condition and is at risk for volume depletion and hypernatremia. Close monitoring of sodium levels and aggressive volume resuscitation are necessary.
4. Hepatitis and Pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of these conditions, which require ongoing monitoring of liver function tests and amylase/lipase"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 118/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% FiO2. The patient has a central venous catheter placed in the left internal jugular vein, and an arterial line has been started. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 36.2 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 76 to 263 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal a newly placed central venous access line over the left internal jugular vein with the tip of the line projecting over the mid SVC. The patient has a noncompressible left common femoral vein likely due to edema. The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic therapy. The patient's condition remains stable,"

   septic shock [**12-18**] salmonella sepsis and pancolitis with course
   complicated by ARF, hepatitis, pancolitis and desquamating drug rash,
   transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, leukocytosis and fever likely
   [**12-18**] acute clostridium difficile infection.
   .
   #C. diff septic shock: Admitted to MICU with fever, leukocytosis and
   tachycardia, requiring pressors.  Also with evidence of end organ
   ischemia.  Stool cx from [**2-20**] confirmed C. diff, has copious stool
   production.  Likely contracted from prolonged hospitalization and
   recent antiibotic use.  Abdominal exam relatively benign with no
   rebound or guarding.  Blood and urine cx NGTD.  Will require aggressive
   care and careful watching for complications.  Lactate trending down,
   WBC trending down

   lithium.  Was significantly volume deplete in setting of DI and acitve
   volume loss from c.diff and diarrhea.  Urine osm of 204 on admission
   supports this.
   - Volume resuscitation with NS, LR
   - monitor Na closely as will be prone to hypernatremia
   - Free water to maintain Na as is NPO

   # Hepatitis, pancreatitis:  Thought likely [**12-18**] drug reaction, ? zosyn
   vs depakote.  Has been followed by liver service previously, with
   cholestatic picture.  LFT's and PFT's continue to slowly trend down,
   with no evidence that worsening of liver function is contributing to
   his current picture.
   - monitor LFT's, amylase, lipase
   - avoid zosyn/depakote

   # Salmonella Sepsis, pancolitis on admission: Has finished course of
   treatment for salmonella sepis with resolving pancolitis per serial
   abdominal CT's.

   septic shock [**12-18**] salmonella sepsis and pancolitis with course
   complicated by ARF, hepatitis, pancreatitis and desquamating drug rash
   likely [**12-18**] cephalosporisn, transferred to the ICU for tachycardia,
   leukocytosis and fever likely [**12-18**] acute clostridium difficile sepsis.
   .
   #C. diff sepsis: Admitted to MICU with fever, leukocytosis and
   tachycardia, requiring pressors x24 hours.  Stool cx from [**2-20**] confirmed
   C. diff.  Abdominal exam relatively benign with no rebound or
   guarding.  Blood and urine cx NGTD.  Improving, off of pressors for
   about 24 hours.
   - cont PO vanco, IV flagyl
   - Appreciate surgery consult: advancing diet to full liquids
   -continue to replete with IVF, has increased fluid losses [**12-18**] DI
   - continue RIJ CVL placed [**2-21**], given poor peripheral access
   -d/c Aline (of note significant difference between cuff and Aline
   pressures)
   -f/u ID reccs
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine peaked at 5.2 during his admission
   likely [**12-18**] sepsis and hypotension and rhabdomyolysis on admission, has
   been slowly trending down, at 1.5 on transfer to ICU.  Slightly
   increased this morning likely [**12-18**] volume depletion given high urine and
   stool output.
   -monitor Cr
   - IVF boluses as needed
   -full liquids

   #Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: likely [**12-18**] combination of volume
   resuscitation with NS as well as renal dysfunction.
   -IVF with d5/sodium bicarb
   .
   # Diabetes Insipidus: Per patient has a history of having to ""drink
   lots of water"" which he was told was due to 13 years of taking
   lithium.  Urine osm of 204 in the setting of severe volume depletion
   supportive of this.
   - Volume resuscitation with sodium bicarb
   - monitor Na closely as will be prone to hypernatremia
   - allow pt to drink water in order to replace free water losses
   .
   # Hepatitis, pancreatitis:  Thought likely [**12-18**] drug reaction, ? zosyn
   vs depakote.  Has been followed by liver service previously, with
   cholestatic picture.  LFT's and PFT's continue to slowly trend down,
   with no evidence that worsening of liver function is contributing to
   his current picture.
   - monitor LFT's, amylase, lipase
   - avoid zosyn/depakote
   .
   # Salmonella Sepsis, pancolitis on admission: Has finished course of
   treatment for salmonella sepis with resolving pancolitis per serial
   abdominal CT's.
   .
   # AGEP (acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis -> diffuse
   desquamating drug rash thought most likely [**12-18**] cephalosporins.
   Vancomycin also possible but less likely.  Resolving since these abx
   d/c'd [**2-4**].
   - eucerin cream to protect skin
   - Spoke with dermatology: AGEP likely caused by B lactam.  Ok to cont
   PO vanco as is poorly absorbed.  Cont to watch closely
   - Stop PO vanco if rash returns
   .
   # Anemia: Has been stable in the low 20's since admission, likely [**12-18**]
   prolonged illness.  No evidence of acute blood loss.  Required
   transfusion 2 units on transfer to ICU in setting of significant volume
   resuscitation.  Has been stable since.
   - Monitor HCT  daily
   - active type and screen

","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [Known Lastname] is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholism admitted on [Date] with septic shock due to salmonella sepsis and pancolitis. He has had complications such as acute renal failure (ARF), hepatitis, pancreatitis, and a desquamating drug rash likely caused by cephalosporins. He was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, leukocytosis, and fever, which are likely due to acute clostridium difficile sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and tachycardia. His vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/56 mmHg to 128/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The physical examination reveals middle-aged man in NAD, awake, alert, and oriented x3. There are no jugular venous distention and regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds. The chest is clear, abdomen is slightly distended but soft, and there is 3+ peripheral edema. The patient also has scrotal swelling and erythema extending to inner thighs bilaterally.

   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine peaked at 5.2 during his admission
   likely [**12-18**] sepsis and hypotension and rhabdomyolysis on admission, has
   been slowly trending down, at 1.5 on transfer to ICU.  Stable through
   current Cdiff sepsis at 1.4
   -monitor Cr
   - volum resucsitation as above
   # Diabetes Insipidus: Per patient has a history of having to ""drink
   lots of water"" which he was told was due to 13 years of taking
   lithium.  Was significantly volume deplete in setting of DI and acitve
   volume loss from c.diff and diarrhea.  Urine osm of 204 on admission
   supports this.
   - Volume resuscitation with NS, LR
   - monitor Na closely as will be prone to hypernatremia

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholism. He was admitted on [**1-23**] with septic shock, salmonella sepsis, and pancolitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF), hepatitis, pancreatitis, and a desquamating drug rash. He is currently in the ICU for tachycardia, leukocytosis, and fever, likely due to acute clostridium difficile infection (C. diff).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 34.7°C (94.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 98/56 mmHg to 128/74 mmHg, heart rate of 97 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, with an arterial blood gas (ABG) of ///12/. Physical examination findings include impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and tachycardia.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. C. diff septic shock: The patient has evidence of end-organ ischemia and copious stool production. He requires aggressive care and careful monitoring for complications. Blood and urine cultures are pending.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels peaked at 5.2 during his admission, likely due to sepsis and hypotension. It has been slowly trending down and is currently at 1.4. Monitoring of creatinine levels is important, along with continued volume resuscitation.

3. Diabetes Insipidus (DI): The patient has a history of DI, which is likely due to long-term lithium use. He is volume depleted and experiencing active volume loss from C. diff and diarrhea. Urine osmolarity of 204 supports this diagnosis. The patient requires volume resuscitation with normal saline (NS) or lactated Ringer's (LR), monitoring of sodium levels, and encouragement of water intake to replace free water losses.

4. Hepatitis and Pancreatitis: The patient likely experienced drug-induced hepatitis and pancreatitis, possibly related to zosyn or depakote. Liver function tests (LFTs) and pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) should be monitored, and the patient should avoid these medications.

5. Salmonella Sepsis and Pancolitis: The patient has completed treatment for salmonella sepsis and is showing resolution of pancolitis on serial abdominal CT scans.

6. Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP): The patient has a diffuse desquamating drug rash that is resolving since discontinuation of antibiotics. Topical triamcinolone cream may help with rash symptoms. The patient can continue taking oral vancomycin, as it"
