","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, admitted to the ICU for pain control and monitoring. She has acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and is currently experiencing nausea, tachypnea, and pain. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. The patient is well-nourished and overweight, with tender epigastric abdomen. Laboratory results indicate mild hypokalemia and hypernatremia. Imaging reveals bibasilar atelectasis, and further tests are pending. The patient is receiving aggressive hydration, pain management, and close monitoring of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatic necrosis: The patient's history of chronic pancreatitis increases the risk of developing pancreatic necrosis, a severe complication where dead tissue needs to be removed.
2. Pseudocyst formation: Another complication of pancreatitis is the formation of pseudocysts, which are collections of fluid around the pancreas that can cause pain and digestive issues.
3. Infection: Due to the presence of necrotic tissue or pseudocysts, there is a risk of bacterial infection, leading to abscess formation and sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The bibasilar atelectasis observed on the chest x-ray indicates collapsed lung tissue, which can compromise oxygenation and lead to respiratory failure if not addressed promptly.
5. Hypotension and shock: The"

Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/70 to 125/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished but overweight/obese. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the epigastric region. Lab results show elevated lipase levels but decreasing trend, normal glucose levels, slightly low calcium levels, and an elevated lactate level. Imaging shows bibasilar atelectasis on chest x-ray, with a CT abdomen pending. The patient's triglyceride levels are significantly increased, likely due to pancreatic dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatic necrosis: Although the patient currently does not show signs of pancreatic necrosis, it remains a potential complication of acute pancreatitis.
2. Pseudocyst formation: The patient may develop a pseudocyst as a result of her chronic pancreatitis. Monitoring for symptoms such as abdominal pain, early satiety, or jaundice would be important.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to her critically ill state and possible immunocompromised status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis admitted to the ICU for pain control. She has been sedated and intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by fever, tachycardia, possible right lower lobe infiltrate, and chest pain with EKG changes suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. She also has depression and is being held on wellbutrin and citalopram while NPO. The patient's APACHE II score is 7, indicating a predicted death rate of 7.6%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on her ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma should be closely monitored for.

2. Acute on Chronic Alcoholic Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely exacerbated by recent binge alcohol consumption. Monitoring for complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation would be important. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and nutritional support are necessary to manage the condition.

3. Cardiac Issues: The patient's chest pain and EKG changes raise concern for possible cardiac involvement. While cardiac enzymes are negative, ongoing monitoring for signs of myocardial infarction or ischemia would be necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis admitted to the ICU for pain control. The patient's APACHE II score is 7, indicating a predicted death rate of 7.6%. The patient has been started on aggressive fluid resuscitation and is being titrated to urine output of 50-75cc/h. The patient is also receiving neo for goal MAP >60 and empirically started on vanc/zosyn/cipro, with consideration of switching to imipenem. The patient is NPO and being considered for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or nasogastric (NJ) tube feeding. Repeat triglyceride levels will be checked, and if >500, gemfibrozil 600 will be started. The patient's HCT will be trended, and an abdominal re-image will be done this morning with IV n-acetylcysteine (NAC). A follow-up general surgery consult has been requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, organ failure, and pancreatic necrosis.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely due to aggressive volume resuscitation for pancreatitis. ARDS is characterized by severe hypoxemia and can progress to multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Chest Pain: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, currently admitted to the ICU for pain control. The patient has severe pancreatitis with concern for widespread necrosis, no gas-containing pancreatic fluid collection, and no obvious vascular complications. The patient also has developed bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, indicating the possibility of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition is deteriorating, with a significant progression of severe pancreatitis and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening pancreatitis with possible necrosis and systemic complications.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to hypoxemic respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
5. Nosocomial infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infection.
6. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome due to severe pancreatitis and sepsis.
7. Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
8. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly calcium and electrolyte imbalances.

   1. Pancreatitis: sudden decompensation over past day with respiratory
   failure, dropping urine output, shock, now with pancreatic necrosis.
   - Started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Bowel rest / supportive care
   - Will try to get IR NJ tube for feeding
   2.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Had high FiO2 requirement with
   difficulty  ventilating by last blood gas and high PP
s/poor lung
   compliance. Change to ARDSnet ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg) with increased
   RR and re-check blood gas, continue sedation, on paralysis. Now weaned
   down to 50% FiO2 with improved CXR.
   - Will take off paralytics after IR -> if difficult to ventilate may
   try PS as no longer looks like fulfills ARDS criteria
   3. Shock/ SIRS physiology
 on neo to maintain MAP>65
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with pancreatitis, complicated by acute respiratory failure. The timing of events suggests an alcoholic etiology. The patient has developed pancreatic necrosis and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, dropping urine output, shock, and poor lung compliance. The patient's condition requires intensive care unit (ICU) care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which has led to necrosis and complications such as respiratory failure and shock. It is important to continue supportive care, bowel rest, and consider interventions like gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia and surgery if necessary.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has difficulty ventilating and high FiO2 requirements, indicating ARDS. ARDSnet ventilation, sedation, and paralysis have been initiated. Close monitoring and weaning off paralytics should be considered.
3. Shock/Sepsis-Induced Hypotension (SIRS) Physiology: The patient is experiencing shock and SIRS physiology. Neo pressure support should be continued to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and pressors should be weaned off as tolerated.
4. Infection/Delirium: Fevers may represent pancreatitis-related infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and cultures should be monitored.
5. Hypocalcemia: Calcium replacement should be administered due to the patient's low"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with pancreatitis- course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure. Timing of events suggestive of alcoholic etiology,
   elevated TG
s noted but unusual to develop several days after
   hospitalization
   1. Pancreatitis: sudden decompensation over past day with respiratory
   failure, dropping urine output, shock, now with pancreatic necrosis.
   - Started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Bowel rest / supportive care
   - Will try to get IR NJ tube for feeding
   2.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Had high FiO2 requirement with
   difficulty  ventilating by last blood gas and high PP
s/poor lung
   compliance. Change to ARDSnet ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg) with increased
   RR and re-check blood gas, continue sedation, on paralysis. Now weaned
   down to 50% FiO2 with improved CXR.
   - Will take off paralytics after IR -> if difficult to ventilate may
   try PS as no longer looks like fulfills ARDS criteria
   3. Shock/ SIRS physiology
 on neo to maintain MAP>65
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.
   4. ID: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with zosyn/[**Month/Year (2) **]

   - Continue to follow cultures

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with pancreatitis, complicated by acute respiratory failure. The timing of events suggests an alcoholic etiology, and elevated triglycerides were noted but developed several days after hospitalization.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Pancreatitis: The patient experienced sudden decompensation over the past day with respiratory failure, dropping urine output, shock, and now has pancreatic necrosis.
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient had high FiO2 requirements with difficulty ventilating, poor lung compliance, and high plateau pressures. She was changed to ARDSnet ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 cc/kg and increased respiratory rate. Sedation and paralysis were continued, but FiO2 was weaned down to 50% with improved chest X-ray.
- Shock/Sepsis-induced hypotension and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): The patient received neomycin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and was weaned off pressors as tolerated.
- Infection: The patient had fevers likely due to pancreatitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued with piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin was discontinued. Cultures were followed.
- Hypocalcemia: Calcium replacement was given.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:
1. Pancreatitis-related complications: Pancreatic necrosis, infected"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, admitted to the ICU for pain control. The patient's current condition includes necrotizing pancreatitis, hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARDS), depression, and fluid overload. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and her vital signs are stable. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and central venous catheter. She is receiving tube feeds and antibiotics for infection. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging shows widespread necrosis involving the body and tail of the pancreas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and positive urine culture for Escherichia coli. This indicates a possible infection, which can worsen if not appropriately treated.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 766 mL since 12 AM. This suggests fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to the underlying pancreatitis and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Pancreatitis Progression: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with widespread necrosis. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis admitted to the ICU for pain control. The patient's medical history includes binge alcohol consumption, which is the most likely cause of necrotizing pancreatitis. The CT scan showed significant progression of severe pancreatitis with widespread necrosis involving the body and tail, extending into the neck but no gas-containing pancreatic fluid collection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 107/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and intubated with an endotracheal tube.

The patient has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, with a total fluid input of 3,001 mL and output of 2,235 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (18.3 K/uL), elevated creatinine level (1.6 mg/dL), elevated lactate level (1.6 mmol/L), and elevated D-dimer level (1219 ng/mL). The patient's imaging shows bilateral fluffy opacities on a portable chest X-ray, indicating possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pancreatitis.

The patient's microbiology report indicates an infection with Escherichia coli in the urine culture, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics including ampicillin"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with pancreatitis- course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure. Timing of events suggestive of alcoholic etiology,
   elevated TG
s noted but as this developed several days after
   hospitalization, may be more a consequence of pancreatitis
   #. Pancreatitis: Developed respiratory failure, decreased urine output,
   shock, now with pancreatic necrosis on CT.
   - Started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Had high FiO2 requirement with
   difficulty  ventilating by last blood gas and high PP
s/poor lung
   compliance. Change to ARDSnet ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg) with increased
   RR and re-check blood gas, continue sedation, on paralysis. Now weaned
   down to 50% FiO2 with improved CXR.
   - CXR looks worse this am.
   - On PS
 Will continue to wean PEEP as tolerated. Goal O2 sat > 92%
   - Follow VBG/sats (art line failed)
   - Diuresis as tolerated
   #. ID: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with zosyn/cipro

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with pancreatitis, which has progressed to acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has developed pancreatic necrosis, shock, and decreased urine output. Her condition is complicated by hypertriglyceridemia and alcoholic etiology. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet ventilation, and her FiO2 requirement has been decreased to 50%. Her CXR shows worsening opacities, and she is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis has led to respiratory failure, decreased urine output, shock, and pancreatic necrosis. Continued monitoring and management of her pancreatitis is essential to prevent further complications.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS requires close monitoring and management. She is currently on ARDSnet ventilation, which aims to minimize lung injury. It is important to continue weaning off FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, while maintaining adequate oxygen saturation.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adherence to VAP prevention protocols, such as elevating head of bed (HOB), daily wake-up trials, and regular assessment of respiratory system infection scores (RSBI), are crucial.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 767 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating fluid overload. Careful monitoring of her fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent fluid-related complications, such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.

5. Hyperglycemia: Regular insulin sliding scale should be continued to maintain glycemic control and prevent hyperglycemia-related complications.

6. Infection: The patient's fevers may indicate an ongoing infection, likely secondary to pancreatitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and regular assessment of cultures is important for guiding antimicrobial therapy.

7. Thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and critical illness. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.

8. Nutritional Support: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition through a post-pyloric feeding tube. Close monitoring of her nutritional status and adjustment of her diet as needed are important to ensure adequate nutrition without causing further complications.

9. Sedation and Analgesia: The patient is sedated and paralyzed to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Regular reassessment of her sedation level and pain control is necessary to ensure appropriate depth of sedation and adequate pain management.

10. Pancreatic Necrosis: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted with pancreatitis and developed acute respiratory failure. The timing of events suggests an alcoholic etiology, and elevated triglyceride levels were noted but may be a consequence of pancreatitis. The patient has now developed pancreatic necrosis on CT. She has been started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia, and no surgical intervention has been planned for now. The patient is also on ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for infection, as well as post-pyloric feeding.

The patient's respiratory failure has been complicated by ARDS, requiring high FiO2 requirement and difficulty ventilating. There is a need to change to ARDSnet ventilation with increased RR and re-check blood gas. The patient has been sedated and paralytic, now weaned down to 50% FiO2 with improved CXR. The plan is to continue weaning PEEP as tolerated, aiming for an oxygen saturation greater than 92%. The patient will also be followed with VBG/sats and diuresis as tolerated.

The patient has had fevers likely representing pancreatitis, so broad-spectrum antibiotics with ciprofloxacin and Zosyn will continue to be administered, and cultures will be monitored.

The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 30 to 21, and there is a possibility of hemorrhagic pancreatitis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She has developed respiratory failure, decreased urine output, shock, and pancreatic necrosis on CT scan. The patient has been started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia and will continue with ciprofloxacin and zosyn antibiotics. Post-pyloric feeding has also been initiated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition has worsened with the development of pancreatic necrosis on CT scan. Surgery has been considered but not yet performed. Repeat CT scan will be obtained to evaluate for hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation, paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved, and the patient is now on 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. PEEP requirement is high. The patient's CXR looks worse this morning, and she will continue to be weaned off PEEP as tolerated. Attempt will be made to re-site the arterial line, and diuresis will be continued.
3. ID: Fevers are likely due to pancreatitis. Broad spectrum abx with zosyn/cipro will be continued, and cultures will be followed.
4. Hct drop: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 30 to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis admitted to the ICU for pain control. She has a history of binge alcohol consumption and her CT scan showed significant progression of severe pancreatitis with widespread necrosis involving the body and tail, extending into the neck but no gas-containing pancreatic fluid collection. She is currently receiving antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition (TF), and gemfibrozil for hypertriglyceridemia. Her vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. She is sedated and intubated on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 50%. Her laboratory results indicate anemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging reveals extensive third spacing, bilateral dependent consolidations, patchy infiltrates at the lung bases, and a diffusely hypodense appearance of the liver. The patient's APACHE II score is 7. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and history of pancreatitis put her at risk for infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and imaging studies will be important to detect any signs of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pancreatitis. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and the need for continued"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis admitted to the ICU for pain control. She has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, famotidine, pantoprazole, and lasix.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 120/66 mmHg to 105/51 mmHg, heart rate between 105 and 118 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg and a blood glucose level of 148 mg/dL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.2 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) from 26.0% to 19.5% and then to 23.2%, slightly elevated platelet count (Plt) of 180 K/uL, increased creatinine (Cr) of 1.5 mg/dL, decreased total CO2 (TCO2) of 19 mmol/L, and elevated lactic acid level of 1.3 mmol/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
    #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Stable on most recent CT.  No evidence of
   hemorrhage at this time.
   - Started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on  50% FiO2
   and off paralytics. PEEP requirement is high on PSV with TV in
   400-500.  Now with increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings
   concerning for VAP.
   - Will try to re-site art line
   - I/Os even today given tachycardia
   - Restart vancomycin for VAP (CXR improved on it and has worsened now
   that she is off)
   - Sputum culture
   #. ID: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with zosyn/cipro. Add back vanco.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   # Hct drop: Bumped appropriately after 4 units.  No evidence of active
   bleed (guiac +, abd CT negative). On PPI.
   - Serial hcts
   #FEN/GI: Restart TF post-pyloric. Start bowel regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is stable without evidence of hemorrhage at this time. However, there is a risk of infection in the necrotic tissue.

2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation, paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide PEEP management. The patient's ventilator requirements have improved but still requires high PEEP. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Volume overload: The patient shows signs of volume overload, as indicated by the elevated CVP, bladder pressures in the teens, and diuresis.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been consistently elevated, indicating poor glycemic control.

5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has imbalances in potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and calcium (Ca++) levels.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been low, indicating a potential risk for bleeding complications.

7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's BUN and creatinine levels have been elevated, suggesting renal impairment.

8. Coagulopathy: The patient's PT/"

   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock
   #. Pancreatitis: Developed respiratory failure, decreased urine output,
   shock, now with pancreatic necrosis on CT.
   - Started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
   - given 10 pt drop in Hct will obtain repeat CT to eval for hemorraghic
   pancreatitis
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on  50% FiO2
   and off paralytics. PEEP requirement is high. Switched to PSV yesterday
   evening, unsure if pt did not tolerate AC off paralytics
   - CXR looks worse this am.
   - On PS
 Will continue to wean PEEP as tolerated. Goal O2 sat > 92%
   - Will try to re-site art line
   - Diuresis as tolerated
   - Restart vanco
   #. ID: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with zosyn/cipro
   - Continue to follow cultures

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She was admitted with pancreatic necrosis and developed respiratory failure, decreased urine output, and shock. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV). She is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to fevers likely representing pancreatitis.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have dropped from 26 to 21, raising concern for acute blood loss anemia. There are no obvious signs of bleeding, but there is a suspicion of hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) have been transfused, and serial Hct measurements will be done along with changing to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with decreased ventilator requirements. However, her chest X-ray (CXR) looks worse, indicating persistent pulmonary edema. The goal is to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. The patient's line will be repositioned, and diuresis will be continued as tolerated.

The patient's abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan shows no evidence of acute bleeding or increased peripancreatic fluid. The plan is to continue gemfibrozil for hypertriglyceridemia and post-pyloric feeding.

Overall, the patient remains critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOD"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
    #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No
   evidence of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on  50% FiO2
   and off paralytics. PEEP requirement is high on PSV with TV in
   400-500.  Now with increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings
   concerning for VAP.
   - Will try to re-site art line
   - If oxygenation permits, will try to wean PEEP
   - I/Os even today given tachycardia
   - Restart vancomycin for VAP (CXR improved on it and has worsened now
   that she is off)
   - Follow up sputum culture
   #. ID: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with zosyn/cipro. Add back vanco.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   # Hct drop: Bumped appropriately after 4 units.  No evidence of active
   bleed (guiac +, abd CT negative). On PPI.
   - Serial hcts
   #FEN/GI: Restart TF post-pyloric. Start bowel regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She now appears to be complicated by volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition remains critical.

24-hour events include a line malfunction, fever, a drop in hematocrit level that was corrected with blood transfusions, and a CT scan of the abdomen that showed no evidence of acute bleeding. The patient's bladder pressures were in the teens, indicating possible urinary retention. Diuresis was performed, and she was given pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 467 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 16 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%. Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 97%. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 39°C, heart rate (HR) of 107 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 123/72 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and an increased central venous pressure (CVP) of 18 mmHg.

Laboratory findings reveal elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hematocrit"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis admitted to the ICU for pain control. The patient's medical history includes a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 26 to 19.5, resulting in anemia and the transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient's condition also includes hypoxemic respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from pancreatitis, depression, and constipation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 112/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a range of 20.2-28.4 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin concentration with a range of 21.2-31.6 g/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level at 666 IU/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. She was admitted to the ICU for pain control and has an APACHE II score of 7. The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, likely caused by binge alcohol consumption. Her recent CT scan showed significant progression of severe pancreatitis with widespread necrosis involving the body and tail, extending into the neck. However, there is no gas-containing pancreatic fluid collection. The patient is currently on continuous vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) via nasogastric tube, as well as gemfibrozil for hypertriglyceridemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 26% to 19.5%, and her stool was guaiac positive. She received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. Despite initial stability, her hematocrit only increased to 23 and is now at 31. A non-contrast CT abdomen did not show evidence of an acute bleed.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is suspected to have Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) from pancreatitis. Efforts are being made to wean the patient off positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and follow oxygen saturation levels. The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on 50% FiO2
   and off paralytics. PEEP requirement is high on PSV with TV in 500s.
   Now with increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning
   for VAP.
   - Will try to re-site art line
   - Wean PEEP based on ABG
   -.AC ventilation attempted using Tv
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV, did decrease PS from
   10 to 8 to attempt to decrease TVs
   - Auto diuresis
   - On vancomycin for VAP
   - Resend sputum culture
   #. ID: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/zosyn/cipro.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   #. Hct drop: Bumped appropriately after 4 units [**10-15**].  No evidence of
   active bleed (guiac +, abd CT negative). On PPI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She now appears to be complicated by volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with no evidence of hemorrhage. She requires mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected VAP. Her condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, abscess formation, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation and is now on mechanical ventilation with increased secretions and elevated white blood cell count, concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Volume Overload: The patient shows signs of volume overload with increased fluid intake and output balance.
4. VAP: The patient's symptoms of fever, increased secretions, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of VAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.
5. Shock: The patient was initially in shock, which can be life-threatening and may require further interventions.
6. Alcoholic Pancreatitis: The patient's underlying alcoholic pancreatitis can continue to progress and cause complications such as pancreatic necrosis and pseudocysts."

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Started on gemfibrizol for hypertriglyceridemia
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on  50% FiO2
   and off paralytics. PEEP requirement is high on PSV with TV in
   400-500.  Now with increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings
   concerning for VAP.
   - Will try to re-site art line
   - If oxygenation permits, will try to wean PEEP
   - I/Os even today given tachycardia
   - Restart vancomycin for VAP (CXR improved on it and has worsened now
   that she is off)
   - Follow up sputum culture
   #. ID: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with zosyn/cipro. Add back vanco.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   # Hct drop: Bumped appropriately after 4 units.  No evidence of active
   bleed (guiac +, abd CT negative). On PPI.
   - Serial hcts
   # FEN/GI: Restart TF post-pyloric. Start bowel regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She now appears to have complications including volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.6°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/70 to 136/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 228, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 17.8 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, clear breath sounds with diminished bases, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and edema in both lower extremities. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, lipase, and D-dimer levels. Imaging"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. She is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 98-123 bpm, blood pressure of 118/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has been febrile and leukocytic with no evidence of necrosis or hemorrhagic complication on most recent CT scan. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition (TF), insulin infusion for hyperglycemia, and gemfibrozil for hypertriglyceridemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and leukocytosis may indicate a superimposed infection on top of severe pancreatitis. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any signs of infection, particularly at the radial internal jugular (RIJ) site.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS require careful management of PEEP to maintain oxygen saturation above 93%. Alternative methods of ventilation should be considered if the current mode is not effective. Daily spontaneous breathing trials should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. He is currently in the ICU for ongoing management and support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Despite negative culture results, the possibility of a superimposed infection should be considered, especially given the severity of the pancreatitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further evaluation of the fever workup is pending.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS and is receiving ventilatory support. There has been steady improvement in oxygenation, allowing for weaning off ventilator support. However, close monitoring of oxygen saturation and daily chest X-rays are necessary to assess the progress and prevent any potential complications.

3. Pancreatitis Complications: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, which carries its own set of complications. These may include progressive necrosis, hemorrhage, or the development of pancreatic pseudocysts. Frequent reassessment and repeat imaging, such as CT scans, may be required to monitor for these complications.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is receiving insulin infusions to manage hyperglycemia. Maintaining tight glycemic control is crucial to prevent complications associated with high blood sugar levels.

5. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient is showing"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on 50% FiO2
   and off paralytics. PEEP requirement is high on PSV with TV in 500s.
   Now with increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning
   for VAP.
   - Will try to re-site art line
   - Wean PEEP based on ABG
   -.AC ventilation attempted using Tv
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV, did decrease PS from
   10 to 8 to attempt to decrease TVs
   - Auto diuresis
   - On vancomycin for VAP
   - Resend sputum culture
   #. ID: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/zosyn/cipro.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   #. Hct drop: Bumped appropriately after 4 units [**10-15**].  No evidence of
   active bleed (guiac +, abd CT negative). On PPI.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn x 14 days
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on PS, 50%
   FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased secretions, elevated
   WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP.  Have tried ARDSnet AC
   ventilation multiple times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV. Unable to place radial
   art line so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Weaning PEEP based on ABG
   - On vancomycin for VAP (8 days)
   - F/U sputum culture. No indication for bronch at this time.
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/zosyn/cipro.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Consider tapping shunt
   # Diarrhea:
   - Stop lactulose
   - F/U C. diff
   - Consider pancreatic enzyme replacement if diarrhea persists

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is now likely complicated by volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition remains critical.

The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation with a tidal volume (TV) of 6 cc/kg, paralytics, and an esophageal balloon to guide PEEP management. However, the patient developed increased secretions, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and CT findings concerning for VAP. Despite attempts at adjusting the ventilation strategy using AC ventilation with TVs between 350-450 cc, the patient became dysynchronous and tachypneic. Currently, the patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and off paralytics.

The patient has not been able to tolerate weaning off the ventilator, and there have been unsuccessful attempts at placing an arterial line. Intermittent arterial blood gases (ABGs) and follow-up oxygen saturation (sats) will be done instead. The PEEP is being weaned based on ABG results.

The patient is on vancomycin for VAP for the past 8 days, and sputum culture is being followed. There is no indication for bronchoscopy at this time.

The patient has fevers and an elevated WBC count, likely due to pancreatitis with superimposed VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She has been diagnosed with necrotizing pancreatitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is now complicated by volume overload. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is sedated and intubated. Her vital signs are unstable, with elevated heart rate, blood pressure fluctuations, and fever. She has increased secretions, elevated white blood cell count, and worsening chest X-ray findings concerning for VAP. The patient's abdominal pressures are high, and she is at risk for pancreatic enzyme-induced diarrhea. Imaging shows improving bilateral infiltrates without effusions, and laboratory results indicate elevated lactate levels and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with high sodium levels. She is receiving aggressive nutritional support, and her code status is full code. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis has progressed to necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, abscess formation, and organ failure.

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has remained hemodynamically stable but continues to have persistent fever and leukocytosis. There is no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on most recent CT. 

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. She is also on insulin to control hyperglycemia and gemfibrozil for hypertriglyceridemia. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is being considered for the patient's nutrition. 

The patient's ARDS is steadily improving, with a decrease in the need for ventilator support. Weaning of PEEP and FiO2 is planned to maintain oxygen saturation above 93%. Daily chest X-rays will be performed to evaluate the patient's respiratory status. 

The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be attributed to severe pancreatitis, but infection cannot be ruled out. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will continue to be administered, and further evaluation of the source of infection is ongoing. 

The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder, anemia, and constipation are also being addressed. The patient's hypernatremia is being managed with increased free water flushes. 

Overall, the patient's care involves managing her pancreatitis, ARDS, potential infection, electroly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has been experiencing fever and leukocytosis, which may be due to severe pancreatitis or a superimposed infection. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and other medications for her conditions. Her respiratory status has been improving, allowing for a decrease in ventilator support. She also has hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and constipation. The patient is in the ICU and is on multiple lines, including a multi-lumen central line for medication administration and fluid management.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection. Since all culture data have been unrevealing, further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis increases the risk for complications such as pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, or hemorrhage.
3. ARDS: Although the patient's respiratory status is improving, she is still at risk for worsening ARDS, which can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia requires careful management with insulin to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte abnormalities need close monitoring and correction to maintain electrolyte balance and prevent complications like arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
6. Constipation: The patient's constipation should be addressed to prevent complications such as fecal impaction or perforation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. She remains hemodynamically stable but continues to have fever and leukocytosis. There is no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on the most recent CT scan. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, allowing for a decrease in ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is at risk for worsening respiratory failure due to her underlying ARDS. Close monitoring and weaning off ventilatory support will be crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Infection: Despite the lack of positive cultures, the patient's persistent fever and leukocytosis raise concerns for a superimposed infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source of infection.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient is experiencing hyperglycemia, which needs to be managed with insulin therapy to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte disorder, specifically hypernatremia, which requires careful management with fluid balance and electrolyte supplementation.
5. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to decreased mobility and use of medications that can cause bowel dysfunction. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.
6. Anemia: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
 Day [**8-1**]
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Will d/w nutrition role of pancreatic enzyme replacement for diarrhea
   - Ensure adequate pain control
 Will start Fentanyl TD today and wean
   gtt
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on PS, 50%
   FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased secretions, elevated
   WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP.  Have tried ARDSnet AC
   ventilation multiple times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV. Unable to place radial
   art line so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Weaning PEEP based on sats
   - On vancomycin for VAP (8 days)
   - F/U sputum culture. No indication for bronch at this time
   - Start weaning Ativan in hopes of extubating later this week to avoid
   trach
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/zosyn/cipro.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   #. Mental status:  Opens eyes, but no withdrawal to pain or spontaneous
   movement of extremities.  Likely due to high levels of sedation
   - Wean sedation as above
   - If persistent, consider head CT and tapping shunt

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 9045**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2256**], whose note reflects
   my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 42 y/o woman with severe
   necrotic pancreatitis has ongoing respiratory failure and continued
   fevers.  Her hemodynamics and respiratory status have improved over the
   past days and she is now tolerating PSV.  We will continue to wean PEEP
   and PSV as tolerated.  Sedation weaning is a major challenge; will
   continue to transition to transdermal narcotics and longer acting
   benzos.  [**Month (only) 11**] be reasonable to try dexmedetomidine; would avoid propofol
   given pancreatic disease.  For fevers and WBC; this may represent
   pancreatitis.  VAP possible.  Fever curve coming down.  If recrudesces,
   consider pancreatic sampling.  For now, continue vanco and change to
   meropenem (better pancreatic and CNS penetration, given VP shunt).
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2256**].  She is critically ill.  30 min

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 42-year-old female with alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock, volume overload, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's current condition includes fever, elevated white blood cell count, and mental status changes.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has improved from initial ARDSnet ventilation.
- The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected VAP.
- Her nutritional status is being managed with enteral feeding.
- The patient's sedation is being weaned off, and efforts are being made to extubate her later this week.
- She has lower extremity edema and the possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is being considered.
- Her lab results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging shows stable chest X-ray with improved infiltrates over the last few days.
- A CT scan reveals necrotizing pancreatitis without evidence of hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis: This condition can lead to infected pancreatic necrosis, which is a life-threatening complication.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation and continues to have ongoing respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted to the ICU with alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has developed volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 160/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has edema in both lower extremities and is sedated with midazolam and fentanyl infusions. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis: The patient's condition may worsen due to the ongoing inflammation and potential development of complications such as infection or abscess formation within the necrotic tissue.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to worsening ARDS.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia and sepsis.
4. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating volume overload, which can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn x 14 days
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on PS, 50%
   FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased secretions, elevated
   WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP.  Have tried ARDSnet AC
   ventilation multiple times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV. Unable to place radial
   art line so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Weaning PEEP based on ABG
   - On vancomycin for VAP (8 days)
   - F/U sputum culture. No indication for bronch at this time.
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/zosyn/cipro.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Consider tapping shunt
   # Diarrhea:
   - Stop lactulose
   - F/U C. diff
   - Consider pancreatic enzyme replacement if diarrhea persists

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She has since developed complications such as volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

24-hour events include the administration of antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam) and various medications (Insulin, Fentanyl, Midazolam, Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium). The patient's vital signs show elevated body temperature, tachycardia, high blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation.

Fluid balance reveals a total intake of 3,721 mL and a total output of 4,050 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 329 mL. The patient's weight has increased from 93 kg at admission to 106.5 kg currently.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, low creatinine levels, elevated TCO2 levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range or do not show significant changes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: No intervention for now, but surgery may be required if necessary. The patient will continue receiving ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam for 14 days and post-pyloric feeding.
2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation and paralytics. Currently, she is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. She has developed signs concerning for VAP and is being treated with vancomycin. Fentanyl and midazolam infusions are also ongoing.
3. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers are likely due to pancreatitis with superimposed VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn, cipro) will be continued, and cultures will be followed. A shunt tapping may be considered.
4. Diarrhea: Lactulose will be stopped, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) will be followed up. Pancreatic enzyme replacement may be considered if diarrhea persists.

ICU care includes nutrition support with Peptamen 1.5 at 50 mL/hour, glycemic control with an insulin infusion, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is now likely complicated by volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition includes necrotizing pancreatitis without evidence of hemorrhage, acute respiratory failure/ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and altered mental status due to high levels of sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: There is no evidence of hemorrhage at this time, but surgical intervention may be necessary if complications arise.
2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there is concern for VAP. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to the patient's inability to be synchronized with lower tidal volumes.
3. Fevers and elevated WBC: These symptoms suggest an ongoing infection, likely related to the pancreatitis or VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued to cover potential pathogens.
4. Mental status alteration: The patient is sedated and demonstrates no withdrawal to pain or spontaneous movement of extremities. Sedation should be weaned as tolerated, and further evaluation with a head CT and shunt tapping may be considered if mental status does not improve.
5. VAP: The patient has developed increased secretions, elevated WBC count, and CT findings concerning for VAP. Appropriate measures such as head of bed"

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has been febrile and leukocytic, but without evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on the most recent CT scan. The patient is currently intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. This could be due to severe pancreatitis or a superimposed infection. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but further evaluation and management are needed, especially considering the unrevealing culture data to date.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been improving but remains unstable. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and close monitoring and adjustment of FiO2 and PEEP are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

3. Pancreatic necrosis: The patient has pancreatic necrosis, which carries the risk of developing infected pancreatic necrosis. Regular monitoring and assessment for signs of worsening necrosis or infection are essential.

4. Delirium: The patient is in the ICU and receiving sedation, which may increase the risk of delirium. Regular neurological assessments and communication with the family are important.

5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to immobilization and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with abdominal pain and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, tachycardia with a heart rate between 107-130 beats per minute, low blood pressure ranging from 72-107/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 93%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Meropenem. They are also on various infusions such as Midazolam (Versed), Insulin, and Fentanyl. Additionally, the patient has been started on Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis and Fentanyl patch.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain. Flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products, indicating possible blood loss and hemorrhage. The patient's weight has increased from 93 kg at admission to 106.5 kg currently.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 26.2 to 28.9 thousand cells per microliter. Hematocrit levels are within normal range. Platelet counts show a decreasing trend from 184 to 318 thousand cells per microl"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day [**9-1**]
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Will d/w nutrition role of pancreatic enzyme replacement for diarrhea
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD today and wean gtt
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on PS, 50%
   FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased secretions, elevated
   WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP.  Have tried ARDSnet AC
   ventilation multiple times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV. Unable to place radial
   art line so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
    This morning more hypoxemia, acidotic, and tachycardic, likely related
   to fatigue and pulmonary edema.
   - Increase from PS 10/5 to [**11-25**]
   - On vancomycin for VAP (8 days)
 adjust dose based on trough of 22
   (hold am dose then decrease to q12)
   - Continue weaning Ativan in hopes of extubating later this week to
   avoid trach
   - Diurese
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   yesterday for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
   #. Mental status:  Opens eyes, but no withdrawal to pain or spontaneous
   movement of extremities.  Likely due to high levels of sedation.
   Minimal improvement
 now tracking to eyes.
   - Contineu to wean sedation
   - If persistent, consider head CT and tapping shunt

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis and complications such as acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock, volume overload, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with intermittent paralysis. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, and persistent fevers. She has right and left lower extremity edema and is sedated with minimal response to stimuli. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate levels, and signs of kidney dysfunction. Imaging shows increased interstitial opacities on chest X-ray, and microbiology tests have not revealed any new data. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin for suspected VAP, and is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. Her condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient's symptoms of increased secretions, elevated WBC count, and CT findings suggest the possibility of VAP. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics, such as vancomycin, is essential.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation due to respiratory failure. She may be at risk for further deterioration and should be closely monitored.
3. Pancreatitis with Pancreatic Necrosis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection,"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/zosyn
 Day [**8-1**]
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Will d/w nutrition role of pancreatic enzyme replacement for diarrhea
   - Ensure adequate pain control
 Will start Fentanyl TD today and wean
   gtt
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on PS, 50%
   FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased secretions, elevated
   WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP.  Have tried ARDSnet AC
   ventilation multiple times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV. Unable to place radial
   art line so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Weaning PEEP based on sats
   - On vancomycin for VAP (8 days)
   - F/U sputum culture. No indication for bronch at this time
   - Start weaning Ativan in hopes of extubating later this week to avoid
   trach
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/zosyn/cipro.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   #. Mental status:  Opens eyes, but no withdrawal to pain or spontaneous
   movement of extremities.  Likely due to high levels of sedation
   - Wean sedation as above
   - If persistent, consider head CT and tapping shunt

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is currently in the ICU and has developed complications such as volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to further complications such as infection or abscess formation.
2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. She has shown improvement but now has developed signs of VAP, which can worsen her respiratory status.
3. VAP: The patient has developed VAP, which is a type of lung infection acquired while on mechanical ventilation. It can lead to worsening of respiratory function and potentially spread to other organs.
4. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is altered likely due to high levels of sedation. Weaning off sedation should be done carefully to avoid extubation failure.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has fluid overload, as indicated by her increased weight and fluid balance chart. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiac dysfunction.
6. Potential need for surgical intervention: The patient's necrotizing pancreatitis may require surgical intervention if there is evidence of hemorrhage or other complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is now likely complicated by volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and several assessments have been made:

1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's CT scan shows no evidence of hemorrhage at this time, so surgery is not necessary for now. The plan is to continue ciprofloxacin and meropenem, start post-pyloric feeding, address diarrhea with pancreatic enzyme replacement, ensure adequate pain control, and wean fentanyl titration.

2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially, the patient required ARDSnet ventilation with paralytics and an esophageal balloon to guide PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved, with the patient now on pressure support (PS) and 50% FiO2. However, the patient developed increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP. Several attempts at ARDSnet assisted control (AC) ventilation using TVs between 350-450 cc were unsuccessful due to dysynchrony and tachypnea. The patient is now back on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and unable to place a radial art line, so intermittent arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and oxygen saturation monitoring will be done. The patient's increased hypoxemia, acidosis"

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has developed several complications including necrotizing pancreatitis, acute renal failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, and fever/leukocytosis. 

Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's abdomen appears more tense, and there is increasing bladder pressure. Surgery has evaluated the patient and is closely following up. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen is planned today.

Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen from 0.5 to 1.8, indicating worsening renal function. Urine electrolytes are consistent with an intrarenal etiology. The concern is for increasing bladder pressure secondary to worsening abdominal process, possibly hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis or abdominal compartment syndrome.

Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with more acidosis. Ventilator support will continue, with FiO2 as tolerated to maintain oxygen saturation above 93%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) will be obtained to further evaluate the acidosis. Daily chest X-rays will be done.

Fever/leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fever and leukocytosis. This may be attributable to severe pancreatitis, but there is a concern for superimposed infection, especially with negative culture data to date. Broad-spectrum"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has remained hemodynamically stable but continues to have fever and leukocytosis. There is no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on recent CT scan. The patient's respiratory status improved overnight but deteriorated in the morning, leading to intubation. She is currently on ventilator support with FiO2 as tolerated to maintain O2 saturation above 93%. The plan is to continue ventilator support, reattempt to place an arterial line, and perform daily chest X-rays. She will also continue on versed at 4 and fentanyl at 200 mcg/hr plus a fentanyl patch. Fever and leukocytosis may be attributed to severe pancreatitis, but there is a concern for superimposed infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further workup is pending. A tap of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt may be considered if all other fever workup is unrevealing. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and insulin via a gastrointestinal tube (TF)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has remained hemodynamically stable but continues to have persistent fever and leukocytosis. There is no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on the most recent CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatic necrosis: The patient's pancreatitis has led to pancreatic necrosis, which can result in complications such as infection, abscess formation, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS requires ongoing ventilator support to maintain adequate oxygenation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly related to the pancreatic necrosis or other sources. This could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis: The concern for hemorrhagic pancreatitis needs to be closely monitored, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's condition may progress to organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic failure, or cardiovascular collapse.
6. Neurological complications: Due to the severity of the patient's illness, there is a risk of neurological complications such as delirium or"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now likely
   complicated by volume overload and VAP.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day [**9-1**]
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Will d/w nutrition role of pancreatic enzyme replacement for diarrhea
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD today and wean gtt
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on PS, 50%
   FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased secretions, elevated
   WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP.  Have tried ARDSnet AC
   ventilation multiple times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV. Unable to place radial
   art line so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
    This morning more hypoxemia, acidotic, and tachycardic, likely related
   to fatigue and pulmonary edema.
   - Increase from PS 10/5 to [**11-25**]
   - On vancomycin for VAP (8 days)
 adjust dose based on trough of 22
   (hold am dose then decrease to q12)
   - Continue weaning Ativan in hopes of extubating later this week to
   avoid trach
   - Diurese
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   yesterday for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
   #. Mental status:  Opens eyes, but no withdrawal to pain or spontaneous
   movement of extremities.  Likely due to high levels of sedation.
   Minimal improvement
 now tracking to eyes.
   - Contineu to wean sedation
   - If persistent, consider head CT and tapping shunt

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. The patient's condition has been complicated by volume overload and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's CT scan shows no evidence of hemorrhage at this time, so no immediate intervention is required. Continue cipro/meropenem therapy and consider post-pyloric feeding. Ensure adequate pain control.
2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially, the patient required ARDSnet ventilation with paralytics and an esophageal balloon to guide PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved, with the patient now on pressure support (PS) and 50% FiO2. However, the patient developed increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP. Multiple attempts at using ARDSnet AC ventilation were unsuccessful due to the patient becoming dyssynchronous and tachypneic. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and unable to place a radial art line, so intermittent ABGs and follow-up oxygen saturations will be performed instead. In the morning, the patient showed more hypoxemia, acidosis, and tachycardia, likely related to fatigue and pulmonary edema. Increase PS from 10/5 to 11/25, continue weaning,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. The patient's current condition includes volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, which is a severe form of pancreatitis characterized by inflammation and death of pancreatic tissue. Complications can include infection, abscess formation, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic pseudocyst.

2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a serious lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood and can result in multiple organ failure if not treated promptly.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation. VAP can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of mortality.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. ARF can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

5. Intraabdominal hemorrhage/bleeding: The patient's tense"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unchanged  on most recent CT.  No evidence
   of hemorrhage at this time.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day [**10-1**]
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD today and wean gtt
   - Hct gtt today with increased bladder pressure and tense abdomen
   concern for intraabominal hemorrhage / hemorrhagic pancreatitis -> will
   repeat abd CT today
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on PS, 50%
   FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased secretions, elevated
   WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP.  Have tried ARDSnet AC
   ventilation multiple times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Back to PSV. Unable to place radial
   art line so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.   Was improving,
   but now requiring more PS.
   - Increase from PS 10/5 to [**11-25**] to 15/8 with progressive acidosis on
   VBG
   - Check ABG today and calculate acid/base status
   - On vancomycin for VAP (Day [**6-25**])
 adjust dose based on trough of 22
   (hold am dose then decrease to 750mg q12)
   - Hold diurese given ARF
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   yesterday for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
   # ARF: Worsening creatinine.  FeNa c/w intrarenal process.  Elevated
   bladder pressure concerning for obstructive physiology.
   - U/A, eos
   - Abd CT as above
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Hold lasix for now
   #. Mental status:  Opens eyes, but no withdrawal to pain or spontaneous
   movement of extremities.  Likely due to high levels of sedation.
   Minimal improvement
 now tracking to eyes.
   - Contineu to wean sedation
   - If persistent, consider head CT and tapping shunt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock, volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). She has worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and no new microbiological data. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with no evidence of hemorrhage at this time. Surgery may be required if the condition worsens.
2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation but has improved and is now on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with 50% FiO2. There are concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increased secretions, elevated white blood cell count, and CT findings. The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics for VAP.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, indicating ARF. This may be due to an intrarenal process. Further evaluation with urine analysis, eosinophils, and abdominal CT is needed. Lasix administration should be held for now.
4. Mental status: The patient has minimal movement and withdrawal to pain. This could be due to high levels of sedation. Sedation should be weaned, and if there is no improvement, a head CT and shunt tapping may be"

   Necrotizing pancreatitis
 Overnight, had increasing bladder pressures,
   developed acute renal failure. Abdomen appears more tense. Evaluated by
   surgery overnight and this morning. They are closely following. Fever &
   leukocytosis persist; no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has developed acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, and chronic pancreatitis. The patient's abdomen appears more tense with increasing bladder pressures, and there is no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on most recent CT. The patient's condition is being closely followed by surgery, and a repeat CT abdomen today has been ordered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued, as well as TF via NJ. Insulin gtt is being continued for hyperglycemia, and gemfibrozil is being continued for hypertriglyceridemia. The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS is being managed with ventilator support and FiO2 as tolerated to maintain O2 sat > 93%. ABG and VBG will be obtained to further evaluate acidosis, and daily CXR will be performed. Acute renal failure is present, with a creatinine level of 1.8. Urine lytes are consistent with intrarenal etiology, and there is concern for increasing bladder pressure secondary to worsening abdominal process. A CT abdomen has been ordered, along with UA, Urine sediment, and U eos. Lasix has been held, and Vancomycin and Meropenem have been redosed. Fever/le"

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient developed acute renal failure overnight, with increasing bladder pressures and a tense abdomen. The patient has persistent fever and leukocytosis, with no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on most recent CT. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening pancreatic necrosis or hemorrhage, which may require surgical intervention.
2. Progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may necessitate continued ventilator support and monitoring of oxygenation levels.
3. Acute renal failure, which may require further evaluation and management, including fluid restriction and adjustment of medications.
4. Infection, given the presence of fever and leukocytosis, despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. This may require additional cultures and consideration for Clostridium difficile infection.
5. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypocalcemia, which should be monitored and managed accordingly.
6. Constipation, which can be managed with appropriate bowel regimens.
7. Anemia secondary to blood loss, which should be evaluated and managed as necessary.
8. Hypoglycemia, which may require close monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy.
9. Abdominal compartment syndrome, given the increasing bladder pressures and tense abdomen. This may require urgent surgical decompression.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies to"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Bladder pressure 23 today.  CT abd without
   additional acute processes.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day [**11-1**]
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD and gtt
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements subsequently improved and
   placed on PS, 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased
   secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP
 s/p 8
   days of vanc (d/c
ed [**10-22**]).  Have tried ARDSnet AC ventilation multiple
   times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg IBW=386)- with each
   attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic, no improv
t with
   heavy sedation. At that time, better to have TVs in 500s than be
   chronically paralyzed. Was improving, but worsening ventilation over
   the past few days requiring more PS and now back on AC, but tolerating
   this time.  Unable to place radial art line so will do intermittent
   ABGs and follow sats.
   - Continue AC ventilation
   - Hold diuresis given ARF
   - Plan for trach Friday
 IP consult today
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP, now s/p 8 day course of vanc.  U/A positive.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **] [**10-19**]
   for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
    # ARF: Worsening creatinine.  FeNa c/w intrarenal process.
   Unremarkable appearance on CT.   Eos negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Try IVF bolus to see if possible pre-renal component despite FeNa
   # RLE swelling: New since yesterday

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is currently experiencing volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's condition has been complicated by necrotizing pancreatitis, ARDS, and fever with an elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's elevated bladder pressure indicates ongoing inflammation in the abdomen. Surgery may be necessary if there are no signs of improvement or if complications arise.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation and paralytics for respiratory support. However, she developed increased secretions and a high white blood cell count, suggesting VAP. The patient's ventilation requirements have fluctuated, with periods of improvement followed by worsening over the past few days.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count, there is a concern for VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are being monitored.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate declining renal function. Further evaluation, including the possibility of IVF bolus administration to assess pre-renal component, is needed.
5. Right lower extremity swelling: The patient has developed new swelling in her"

   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis:
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day [**10-1**]
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD today and wean gtt
   - Hct drop today with increased bladder pressure and tense abdomen
   concern for intraabominal hemorrhage / hemorrhagic pancreatitis -> will
   repeat abd CT today
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements have improved now on PS, 50%
   FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased secretions, elevated
   WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP.  Have tried ARDSnet AC
   ventilation multiple times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg
   IBW=386)- with each attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic,
   no improv
t with heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in
   500s than be chronically paralyzed. Unable to place radial art line so
   will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
    Was improving, but worsening ventilation over the past few days
   requiring more PS.
   - Increase from PS 10/5 to [**11-25**] to 15/8 with progressive acidosis on
   VBG
   - Check ABG today and calculate acid/base status
   - On vancomycin for VAP (Day [**6-25**])
 adjust dose based on trough of 22
   (hold am dose then decrease to 750mg q12)
   - Hold diurese given ARF
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   yesterday for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
   # ARF: Worsening creatinine.  FeNa c/w intrarenal process.  Elevated
   bladder pressure concerning for obstructive physiology.
   - U/A, eos
   - Abd CT as above
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Hold lasix for now
   #. Mental status:  Opens eyes, but no withdrawal to pain or spontaneous
   movement of extremities.  Likely due to high levels of sedation.
   Minimal improvement
 now tracking to eyes.
   - Continue to wean sedation
   - If persistent, consider head CT and tapping shunt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is now complicated by volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for infection, including ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin. She is also on fentanyl for pain control and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and tachypnea. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation with positive pressure ventilation. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, high creatinine levels, and abnormalities in electrolytes and liver function tests. Imaging reveals stable bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Surgery will be considered if necessary, and the patient will continue receiving ciprofloxacin and meropenem. Post-pyloric feeding will be initiated, and pain control will be ensured by weaning off gtt fentanyl.
2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation but has improved to partial support with pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and 50% FiO2. She is off paralytics, but her ventilation requirements have increased due to suspected"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Bladder pressure 23 today.  CT abd without
   additional acute processes.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day [**11-1**]
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD and gtt
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements subsequently improved and
   placed on PS, 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased
   secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP
 s/p 8
   days of vanc (d/c
ed [**10-22**]).  Have tried ARDSnet AC ventilation multiple
   times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg IBW=386)- with each
   attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic, no improv
t with
   heavy sedation. At that time, better to have TVs in 500s than be
   chronically paralyzed. Was improving, but worsening ventilation over
   the past few days requiring more PS and now back on AC, but tolerating
   this time.  Unable to place radial art line so will do intermittent
   ABGs and follow sats.
   - Continue AC ventilation
   - Hold diuresis given ARF
   - Plan for trach Friday
 IP consult today
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP, now s/p 8 day course of vanc.  U/A positive.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **] [**10-19**]
   for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
    # ARF: Worsening creatinine.  FeNa c/w intrarenal process.
   Unremarkable appearance on CT.   Eos negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Try IVF bolus to see if possible pre-renal component despite FeNa
   - consider renal consult if fxn continues to worsen
   # RLE swelling: New since yesterday
   - LE doppler

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is now experiencing volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's condition has been complicated by necrotizing pancreatitis, ARDS, and an inability to tolerate low tidal volumes on the ventilator. She has been placed on pressure-controlled ventilation with increased tidal volumes and is also experiencing worsening ventilation. The patient has fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and a positive urine analysis. Her renal function has worsened, and there are signs of right lower extremity swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's bladder pressure is elevated, indicating ongoing inflammation and potential complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis or further deterioration of the pancreas.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased secretions, elevated WBC count, and CT findings are concerning for VAP. This is a common complication in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation but was unable to tolerate low tidal volumes. She has since been placed on pressure-controlled ventilation, which may help manage her condition but carries its own risks.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate declining renal function. Intrarenal processes are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient is intubated and sedated, currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 50% to maintain O2 saturation above 93%. The patient has persistent fever and leukocytosis, with no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on recent CT scan. There is extensive peripancreatic inflammation. The patient's renal function has worsened, with a rising creatinine level from 0.5 two days ago to 1.9 currently. Urine electrolytes are consistent with an intrarenal etiology. There is concern for increasing bladder pressure secondary to worsening abdominal process, possibly hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis or abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient has hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalances, as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypocalcemia, anemia secondary to blood loss, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function indicated by the rising creatinine level suggests acute renal failure.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently elevated, indicating hyperglycemia.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and calcium, along with abnormal fluid balance.
4. Constipation: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient has been febrile and leukocytosis persists, with no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on recent CT scan. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and ciprofloxacin, and her insulin infusion has been continued for hyperglycemia. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored closely, and she is receiving ventilator support with FiO2 as tolerated to maintain O2 saturation above 93%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) is planned to evaluate acidosis, and daily chest X-rays will be performed. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy on Friday if she is unable to be weaned from the ventilator. The patient also has acute renal failure, with increasing creatinine levels and consistent urine electrolytes indicating an intrarenal etiology. There is concern for increasing bladder pressure secondary to worsening abdominal process, possibly hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis or abdominal compartment syndrome. An IV fluid challenge has been administered, and lasix has been held. The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be attributable to severe pancreatitis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is febrile and leukocytic, with persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is extensive peripancreatic inflammation without evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on recent CT scans.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may be due to acute renal failure, possibly secondary to the abdominal process or hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been receiving insulin infusions for hyperglycemia. If the insulin dosing is not adjusted appropriately, it can lead to hypoglycemia.

3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte & fluid disorder, which may be due to ongoing losses through various routes (urine, stool, drains) and the administration of IV fluids. Monitoring and adjusting electrolyte levels will be important to prevent complications.

4. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to decreased mobility and medication use (e.g., Fos). Preventive measures such as adequate hydration, stool softeners, and regular bowel assessment should be implemented.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. She has been admitted to the ICU with renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has persistent high blood glucose levels, which can increase the risk of infections, delay wound healing, and cause complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's labs show imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. These imbalances can affect various bodily functions, including muscle contractions, nerve signaling, and hydration status.
4. Constipation/Ostipation: The patient is experiencing difficulty in passing stool due to decreased bowel motility. This can lead to abdominal discomfort, bloating, and potential complications like fecal impaction or bowel perforation.
5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia likely secondary to blood loss. This can result in decreased oxygen-carrying"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Bladder pressure 30 today.  Most recent CT
   abd without persistent pancreatic inflammation, no hemorrhage.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Recheck bladder pressure later today and will inform surgery is
   persistently or more elevated
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day 13/14
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD and gtt
   - Continue insulin gtt and gemfibrizol for hypertriglycerdemia.
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements subsequently improved and
   placed on PS, 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased
   secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP
 s/p 8
   days of vanc (d/c
ed [**10-22**]).  Have tried ARDSnet AC ventilation multiple
   times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg IBW=386)- with each
   attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic; no improv
t with
   heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in 500s than be
   chronically paralyzed. Was improving, but worsening ventilation over
   the past few days requiring more PS.  Unable to place radial art line
   so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Continue PS ventilation
   - Hold diuresis given ARF
   - Plan for trach Friday by IP
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP, now s/p 8 day course of vanc.  U/A positive.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **] [**10-19**]
   for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
    # ARF: Worsening creatinine, but relatively stable over 48hours.  FeNa
   c/w intrarenal process.  Unremarkable appearance on CT.   Eos
   negative.  IVF challenge without improvement.
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Consider renal consult if fxn continues to worsen

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She now has complications including volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.7°F, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 114/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.6 thousand/mm3, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 76 to 131 mg/dL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.2 mmol/L. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, and calcium levels are within normal range. Imaging shows no significant findings except for a stable chest X-ray. 

The patient is diagnosed with necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fevers/elevated white blood cell count likely due to pancreatitis and VAP, and acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Bladder pressure 23 today.  Most recent CT
   abd without persistent pancreatic inflammation, no hemorrhage.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day 13/14
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD and gtt
   - Continue insulin gtt and gemfibrizol for hypertriglycerdemia.
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements subsequently improved and
   placed on PS, 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased
   secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP
 s/p 8
   days of vanc (d/c
ed [**10-22**]).  Have tried ARDSnet AC ventilation multiple
   times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg IBW=386)- with each
   attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic; no improv
t with
   heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in 500s than be
   chronically paralyzed. Was improving, but worsening ventilation over
   the past few days requiring more PS.  Unable to place radial art line
   so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Continue PS ventilation
   - Hold diuresis given ARF
   - Plan for trach Friday by IP
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP, now s/p 8 day course of vanc.  U/A positive.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **] [**10-19**]
   for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
    # ARF: Worsening creatinine, but relatively stable over 48hours.  FeNa
   c/w intrarenal process.  Unremarkable appearance on CT.   Eos negative.
    IVF challenge without improvement.
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Consider renal consult if fxn continues to worsen

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She now has complications including volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's condition is critical, and she requires ongoing medical management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's bladder pressure is elevated, indicating ongoing inflammation and potential risk for further pancreatic necrosis.
2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation and paralytics. She has improved but now shows signs of VAP, as evidenced by increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings. The patient's worsening ventilation and inability to tolerate assisted ventilation may lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fevers and elevated WBC suggest a superimposed infection. Continued broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is necessary, and the patient is planned for tracheostomy to facilitate long-term mechanical ventilation.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine and FeNa indicate an intrarenal process. If renal function continues to deteriorate, a renal consult may be necessary.
5. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of intake compared to output, which may contribute to her respiratory distress and increased risk of complications.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She now has volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's condition is critical, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has elevated bladder pressure, indicating ongoing inflammation and potential complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.

2. Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation but later developed increased secretions and CT findings concerning for VAP. She is currently on pressure support ventilation and may need tracheostomy placement due to anticipated prolonged mechanical ventilation.

3. Fevers/Elevated WBC: The patient has fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, likely due to pancreatitis with superimposed VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and cultures are pending.

4. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, indicating renal dysfunction. FeNa is consistent with an intrarenal process. A renal consult may be considered if renal function continues to deteriorate.

5. RLE swelling: The patient has new lower extremity edema, which could be related to her critical illness and volume overload.

6. VAP: The patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of VAP, including increased secretions, elevated WBC, and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient's current medical complications include renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, ARDS, hypocalcemia, and chronic pancreatitis.

Renal failure is indicated by the rising creatinine levels from 0.5 two days ago to 1.9 currently, along with urine electrolytes consistent with an intrarenal etiology. The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum potassium levels further support the diagnosis of renal failure.

Hyperglycemia is evident from the patient's elevated blood glucose levels, which require continuous insulin infusion.

Electrolyte and fluid disorder is suggested by the imbalances in the patient's sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels. The high urine output may be contributing to these imbalances.

Constipation or obstipation is mentioned as a concern, possibly due to decreased bowel motility.

Anemia is present, likely secondary to blood loss. The cause of the blood loss could be the ongoing bleeding from the necrotizing pancreatitis.

Fever persists despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. While severe pancreatitis could be the cause, it is important to rule out other potential sources of infection.

ARDS or acute respiratory distress syndrome is indicated by the patient's hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and ciprofloxacin) for suspected infection. He has been intubated and placed on ventilatory support with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 50%, PEEP 8 cmH2O, and PS 12 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. His laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated CRP, and acute renal failure with stable creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate ongoing infection or superimposed infection on severe pancreatitis.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and urine electrolytes suggest intrarenal etiology for acute renal failure. Holding lasix for now and restarting it tomorrow may help improve renal function.

3. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is dependent on ventilator support, and close monitoring of VBG and daily CXR is necessary. FiO2 should be adjusted to maintain O2 saturation above 93%. 

4. Pancreatic Necrosis:"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Bladder pressure 30 today.  Most recent CT
   abd without persistent pancreatic inflammation, no hemorrhage.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day 14/14
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD and gtt
   - Off insulin gtt this am and transitioned to RISS; gemfibrizol for
   hypertriglycerdemia.
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements subsequently improved and
   placed on PS, 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased
   secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP
 s/p 8
   days of vanc (d/c
ed [**10-22**]).  Have tried ARDSnet AC ventilation multiple
   times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg IBW=386)- with each
   attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic; no improv
t with
   heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in 500s than be
   chronically paralyzed. Was improving, but worsening ventilation over
   the past few days requiring more PS.  Unable to place radial art line
   so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Continue PS ventilation
   - Hold diuresis given ARF
   - S/p trach by IP
   - Wean sedation as tolerated now that trached
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP, now s/p 8 day course of vanc.  U/A positive.
   - Last day of broad spectrum abx with [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   [**10-19**] for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
    # ARF: Worsening creatinine, but relatively stable over 72hours.  FeNa
   c/w intrarenal process.  Unremarkable appearance on CT.   Eos

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Bladder pressure 30 today.  Most recent CT
   abd without persistent pancreatic inflammation, no hemorrhage.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Recheck bladder pressure later today and will inform surgery is
   persistently or more elevated
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day 13/14
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD and gtt
   - Continue insulin gtt and gemfibrizol for hypertriglycerdemia.
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements subsequently improved and
   placed on PS, 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased
   secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP
 s/p 8
   days of vanc (d/c
ed [**10-22**]).  Have tried ARDSnet AC ventilation multiple
   times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg IBW=386)- with each
   attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic; no improv
t with
   heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in 500s than be
   chronically paralyzed. Was improving, but worsening ventilation over
   the past few days requiring more PS.  Unable to place radial art line
   so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Continue PS ventilation
   - Hold diuresis given ARF
   - Plan for trach Friday by IP
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP, now s/p 8 day course of vanc.  U/A positive.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **] [**10-19**]
   for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
    # ARF: Worsening creatinine, but relatively stable over 48hours.  FeNa
   c/w intrarenal process.  Unremarkable appearance on CT.   Eos
   negative.  IVF challenge without improvement.
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Consider renal consult if fxn continues to worsen

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock, volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Complications related to necrotizing pancreatitis:
- Pancreatic inflammation
- Hemorrhage

2. Complications related to acute respiratory failure/ARDS:
- Progression of ARDS
- Further deterioration of respiratory function
- Development of severe sepsis or septic shock

3. Complications related to VAP:
- Worsening respiratory status
- Development of multi-drug resistant pneumonia
- Spread of infection to other parts of the body

4. Complications related to ARF:
- Worsening kidney function
- Fluid overload due to decreased urine output
- Development of hyperkalemia and/or acidosis

5. Other potential complications:
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization
- Stress ulcers due to critical illness
- Nosocomial infections due to invasive lines and tubes

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's condition and intervene promptly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Bladder pressure 30 today.  Most recent CT
   abd without persistent pancreatic inflammation, no hemorrhage.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day 14/14
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD and gtt
   - Off insulin gtt this am and transitioned to RISS; gemfibrizol for
   hypertriglycerdemia.
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements subsequently improved and
   placed on PS, 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased
   secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP
 s/p 8
   days of vanc (d/c
ed [**10-22**]).  Have tried ARDSnet AC ventilation multiple
   times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg IBW=386)- with each
   attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic; no improv
t with
   heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in 500s than be
   chronically paralyzed. Was improving, but worsening ventilation over
   the past few days requiring more PS.  Unable to place radial art line
   so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Continue PS ventilation
   - Hold diuresis given ARF
   - Plan for trach today by IP
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP, now s/p 8 day course of vanc.  U/A positive.
   - Last day of broad spectrum abx with [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   [**10-19**] for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
    # ARF: Worsening creatinine, but relatively stable over 72hours.  FeNa
   c/w intrarenal process.  Unremarkable appearance on CT.   Eos
   negative.  IVF challenge without improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and shock. She is now complicated by volume overload, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with a high bladder pressure. She is on post-pyloric feeding, ensuring adequate pain control, and has been transitioned off insulin gtt to RISS. The patient initially required ARDSnet ventilation but has improved and is now on pressure support (PS) with 50% FiO2. She developed increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP after 8 days of vancomycin. The patient's ventilation has worsened over the past few days, and she is unable to tolerate higher TV settings. She also has fevers, an elevated WBC, and a positive urinalysis. The patient's creatinine has worsened but is relatively stable over 72 hours. IVF challenge has not improved her condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has a high bladder pressure indicating ongoing inflammation and potential complications related to the pancreatitis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed signs of VAP, including increased secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings. This increases the risk of respiratory infection and possible sepsis.

She also has worsening ventilation over the past few days, requiring more positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's kidney function is deteriorating, indicated by the increasing creatinine levels and fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) consistent with an intrarenal process.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic
   necrosis, acute respiratory failure, acidosis, shock.  Now complicated
   by volume overload, presumed VAP, and ARF.
   #. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Bladder pressure 30 today.  Most recent CT
   abd without persistent pancreatic inflammation, no hemorrhage.
   - Surgery following
 no intervention for now.
   - Continue cipro/meropenem
 Day 14/14
   - Post-pyloric feeding
   - Ensure adequate pain control
  On Fentanyl TD and gtt
   - Off insulin gtt this am and transitioned to RISS; gemfibrizol for
   hypertriglycerdemia.
   #.  Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: Initially requiring  ARDSnet
   ventilation (Tv 6 cc/kg), paralytics, and esophageal balloon to guide
   PEEP management. Ventilator requirements subsequently improved and
   placed on PS, 50% FiO2 and off paralytics. Then developed increased
   secretions, elevated WBC, and CT findings concerning for VAP
 s/p 8
   days of vanc (d/c
ed [**10-22**]).  Have tried ARDSnet AC ventilation multiple
   times using TV
s between 350-450 cc (6cc/kg IBW=386)- with each
   attempt, pt became dyssynchronous and tachypneic; no improv
t with
   heavy sedation. At this time, better to have TVs in 500s than be
   chronically paralyzed. Was improving, but worsening ventilation over
   the past few days requiring more PS.  Unable to place radial art line
   so will do intermittent ABGs and follow sats.
   - Continue PS ventilation
   - Hold diuresis given ARF
   - S/p trach by IP
   - Wean sedation as tolerated now that trached
   #. Fevers/Elevated WBC: Fevers likely represent pancreatitis with
   superimposed VAP, now s/p 8 day course of vanc.  U/A positive.
   - Last day of broad spectrum abx with [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.  (Switched to [**Last Name (un) **]
   [**10-19**] for better CNS coverage given VP shunt)
   - Continue to follow cultures
    # ARF: Worsening creatinine, but relatively stable over 72hours.  FeNa
   c/w intrarenal process.  Unremarkable appearance on CT.   Eos
   negative.  IVF challenge without improvement.
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Consider renal consult if fxn continues to worsen
   - Diuresis in next couple days if continues to be stable

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypocalcemia, and chronic pancreatitis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. It can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Renal Failure: Acute renal failure can result in the inability of the kidneys to effectively filter waste products from the blood, leading to a buildup of toxins and electrolyte imbalances. This can further complicate the patient's overall condition.

3. Hyperglycemia: Elevated blood sugar levels can increase the risk of infections and complicate wound healing. If left uncontrolled, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, which are serious complications of diabetes.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: Disruptions in electrolyte levels, such as potassium, sodium, and calcium, can have significant effects on the heart rhythm and muscle function. Correcting these imbalances is crucial to avoid complications like arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

5. Infection: Fever and the presence of"

   42 yo female admitted with alcoholic pancreatitis- complicated by
   necrosis of >50% pancreas approximately 2-3 days into hospitalization,
   with subsequent acute respiratory failure/ARDS and shock (resolved).
   She underwent trach yesterday for persistent respiratory failure.
   Throughout this time, she has remained febrile most days though the
   severity is gradually decreasing; this has been attributed to her
   severe pancreatitis as cultures have been largely negative.
   Currently on PSV 10/8
   WBC 25,
   Cr 1.8 (worsening of renal function began earlier this wk- cause
   unclear given lack of hypotension or IV contrast but has recently
   stabilized)
   For pancreatitis, will dc antibiotics as intent was for a 14 day
   course.
   For acute respiratory failure, will wean PS settings. Sedation
   requirements have been large, so hopefully we wil be able to
   significantly wean now that she has undergone trach. If not, would
   consider adding methadone to decrease need for fentnyl. Some agitation
   may be from delirium, in which case haldol could be used.
   Pt is critically ill.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who presented with acute necrotizing pancreatitis after a drinking binge. She required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure and eventually needed paralysis, an esophageal balloon, and a tracheostomy. The patient continues to have fevers and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. The patient's renal function has worsened, with a stable creatinine level of 1.8. She has been receiving antibiotics for 15 days, which will be discontinued. The plan is to wean the patient off sedation and improve her respiratory support. The patient remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia may progress, leading to ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory parameters is essential.
2. Sepsis: Despite the patient's fevers and elevated white blood cell count, cultures have been largely negative. However, there is a possibility of developing sepsis due to the ongoing inflammatory response and potential bacterial infection. Regular reassessment of vital signs and infection control measures are necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels. It is crucial to monitor urine output and adjust fluid management accordingly to prevent further deterioration in renal"

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. She has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has several medical complications.

1. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 1.8 to 1.6, indicating some improvement in renal function. However, she still requires close monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte balance.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient is currently on insulin to manage her blood sugar levels. With ongoing insulin therapy, it is important to monitor her glucose levels regularly and adjust the dosage as needed.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in her electrolytes, particularly low calcium levels. These imbalances need to be corrected and monitored closely.

4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This may require transfusion of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

5. Fever: The patient continues to have a persistent fever despite completing a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern for possible superimposed infection, especially considering her immunocompromised state due to severe pancreatitis. Further evaluation, including obtaining fungal blood cultures, is warranted.

6. Shock: The patient has been diagnosed with other causes of shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary.

7. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She has a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient's current health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Fever and leukocytosis persist despite completing broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem/cipro) on day 14.
2. The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, with no evidence of progressive necrosis or hemorrhage on the most recent CT scan.
3. She has acute renal failure, with a stable creatinine level of 1.8.
4. The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, for which she had a successful tracheostomy placement.
5. She requires continued ventilator support, with FiO2 as tolerated to maintain O2 saturation above 93%.
6. Her urine electrolytes are consistent with an intrarenal etiology.
7. The patient has hyperglycemia and requires insulin PRN.
8. She has constipation, possibly due to obstipation caused by FOS (fiber optic sigmoidoscope).
9. The patient has anemia, secondary to blood loss during hemorrhage.
10. She has electrolyte and fluid disorders, including hypocalcemia, which may be related to her pancreatitis and renal failure.
11. The patient is at risk for further complications such as infection, particularly with the persistence of fever and leukoc"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has several medical complications including renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, ARDS, and hypocalcemia. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.9°F, tachycardia with a heart rate of 119 bpm, and hypertension with a blood pressure of 155/86 mmHg. The patient is receiving various medications such as insulin, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and heparin. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high creatinine levels, high glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tracheostomy tube, with oxygen delivery set at 50% FiO2. 

The patient has ongoing issues with fever and leukocytosis, which may be related to severe pancreatitis or superimposed infection. 

Assessment and plan include management of renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, ARDS, and hypocalcemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is abdominal pain. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications. 

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 476 K/uL and creatinine (Cr) level of 1.8. This may be due to factors such as low urine output, fluid imbalance, or medications.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently high, indicating uncontrolled diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia. It is important to monitor and manage blood sugar levels to prevent further complications.

3. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-), as well as a fluid disorder. This could be due to renal dysfunction, fluid administration, or other factors.

4. Constipation/Obsipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which can be a common issue in critically ill patients due to decreased mobility and medication use.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This could be a result of bleeding during surgery, trauma, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

6. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be indicative of an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

7. Shock: The patient is in shock, which is a life"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She continues to be febrile without hemodynamic instability. She has an
   indwelling VP shunt ( placed for problems related to hydrocephalus
   after a CVA). She has ongoing slow sedation wean. We will continue
   antibiotics for now and request neurosurgical input regarding sampling
   CSF to make sure we do not have issues with CSF contamination given
   problems with severe abdominal pancreatic inflammation and necrosis.
   She appears to be tolerating tube feeds well so far. We will continue
   support with CPAP/ PSV for now.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who is currently in the ICU for acute necrotizing pancreatitis and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The respiratory system is showing improvement, but there are still concerns regarding potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of amylase, lipase, lactate, and D-dimer, suggesting ongoing inflammation and possible complications related to the pancreatitis. The patient also has elevated sodium levels, which may be due to dehydration or intrinsic renal disease. 

The patient's volume status is being closely monitored, with goals of maintaining an appropriate intake/output balance to prevent fluid overload. Sedation is being weaned gradually, and nutrition is being provided through tube feeds. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, development of VAP, worsening of kidney function, and the need for further surgical intervention if there are any changes in clinical status. 

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis presenting with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. She has continued fevers and improving respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and supplemental oxygen. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 119 beats per minute, blood pressure of 155/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and D-dimer. Imaging studies show evidence of necrotic pancreatic tissue.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to acute pancreatitis and prolonged hospital stay, there is a risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if there is progression of the underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels suggest potential intrinsic renal disease or acute kidney injury (AKI). Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient"

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hypocalcemia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.6°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 143/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a ventilator. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated platelet count. The patient's imaging studies reveal mild-to-moderate hydrocephalus with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, air-space consolidation in the right middle lobe and lingula of the lung, extensive peripancreatic inflammatory changes and intra-abdominal fluid collection, and extensive third spacing.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, maintaining total parental nutrition, monitoring and treating hyperglycemia, weaning sedation, considering diuretic therapy for fluid overload, obtaining fungal blood cultures, and continuing to support respiratory function on a ventilator. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, development of ventilator"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and consistent urine electrolytes. This may be due to intrarenal etiology and ongoing fluid overload.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which is likely a result of her pancreatitis. Insulin therapy has been initiated to manage blood glucose levels.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with hypernatremia. Fluid management will be focused on minimizing sodium intake while increasing free water administration to achieve a net diuresis.

4. Anemia: The patient is experiencing acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This could be a result of hemorrhagic complications or ongoing bleeding.

5. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be due to ongoing inflammation or infection. Cultures have been negative, but broad-spectrum antibiotics have been restarted.

6. Shock: The patient is at risk of shock due to hypovolemia and fluid overload.

7. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which is causing hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is on mechanical ventilation support and requires careful monitoring."

The note indicates that the patient is experiencing renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypocalcemia, and chronic pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.6°F (39.2°C), blood pressure ranging from 110/49-156/86 mmHg, heart rate between 108-132 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, decreased total CO2 level, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Imaging studies reveal mild-to-moderate hydrocephalus with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, air-space consolidation in the right middle lobe and lingula of the lung, extensive peripancreatic inflammatory changes and intra-abdominal fluid collection, and third spacing of fluids.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, insulin, furosemide (Lasix), midazolam (Versed), and heparin sodium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, currently experiencing acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
- The patient has been in the ICU and is showing signs of improvement in respiratory failure/ARDS, with slowly improving opacities on CXR.
- The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing infection, most likely related to pancreatitis.
- Antibiotics were restarted due to the presence of a shunt, but cultures remain negative.
- Plans include discontinuing ciprofloxacin, performing a lumbar puncture, and continuing to follow cultures.
- Further imaging for acute pancreatitis has been deferred unless there is a change in clinical status.
- Post-pyloric feeding is being continued.
- The patient's sodium level is elevated, and fluid restriction will be titrated accordingly.
- The patient is on acute kidney disease management, with an improving creatinine level and elevated FeNa.
- The patient's volume status is being closely monitored, with goals of maintaining an output of 2 liters per day and switching to D5 carrier when possible.
- Hyperglycemia is being managed by changing from an insulin drip to NPH.
- Sedation is being weaned.
- The patient's need for restraints is being reviewed regularly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute necrotizing pancreatitis and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. There is a potential"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who presented with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient continues to have fevers and improving respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set PS of 10 cmH2O, spontaneous Vt of 430 mL, RR of 27 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 78. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 159/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, diminished breath sounds bilaterally, presence of endotracheal and OG tubes, distended abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, normal glucose levels, and various other lab abnormalities. Imaging shows slowly improving opacities on chest X-ray, and microbiology results are negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure support, continued fever management, monitoring of WBC count, review of sputum yeast, blood culture with fungal isolators, urinal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, presenting with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. She continues to have fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient is on respiratory support with tracheostomy PSV mode, FiO2 0.5. She is also on diuretics and receiving post-pyloric feedings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not respond to the current treatment or if there is a new infection.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a potential infection. Since all cultures are negative, it is likely that the infection is related to the pancreatitis or another source that has not been identified yet.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which needs to be controlled to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or further infection risk.
4. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an elevated sodium level and is at risk of developing fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and titration of fluids and electrolytes are necessary.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has AKD (acute kidney disease) with improving creatinine levels. It is important to monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly to prevent further renal deterioration.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and significant peri-pancreatic inflammation. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's condition includes renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, and hypocalcemia. The patient has chronic pancreatitis and requires continued broad-spectrum antibiotics due to necrotizing pancreatitis. Surgical consultation has been sought, and the patient is being monitored closely for any worsening abdominal exam. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and increased respiratory rate. Fluid balance reveals ongoing fluid losses through various routes, with a net diuresis goal of -1 to 2 liters. Renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 1.5. The patient's nutrition is being managed through tube feeds, and glycemic control is being maintained with insulin subcutaneously. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU."

   Persistent fevers: Most likely [**1-21**] pancreatic inflammation, but need to
   maintain concern for infection.  All cultures negative today and pt
   completed one week course for VAP last week.  Two potential sources of
   concern are pancreas and CNS given foreign body. No overt sign of
   infection on most recent CT abdomen.

   Necrotizing pancreatitis
Surgery has signed off. Fever & leukocytosis
   persist; significant peri-pancreatic inflammation seen on last scan.
   - reconsult surgery if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   - completed broad-spectrum ABXs meropenem/cipro (day 14/14). Meropenem
   restarted.
   - cont TF via NJ
   - convert insulin drip to SQ
   - cont gemfibrozil for hypertriglyceridemia (although more likely a
   result of pancreatitis than a cause)
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/ARDS :  Patient had successful Trach
   placement.
   - continue ventilator support, on PSV, trial of trach mask
   - follow VBG to evaluate status of ventilation
   - daily CXR

   -continue lasix: outs substantial, but pt with significant ins (meds,
   free water flushes, etc)
   Hypernatremia: given fluid overload, will minimize sodium (volume
   intake) while increasing free water and achieving net diuresis with
   lasix (may add metolazone). Reviewed meds, everything that can be given
   in D5 is already being given in D5. Spoke to nutrition, sodium load of
   tube feeds is minimal.
   Acute Renal Failure: Cr down to 1.5 from 1.8.  Urine lytes consistent

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, likely due to pancreatic inflammation. The patient has also been showing signs of altered mental status, renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, and hypocalcemia.

The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy placement, conversion of insulin drip to subcutaneous administration, continuation of gemfibrozil for hypertriglyceridemia, and minimization of sodium intake while increasing free water to address hypernatremia.

The patient's acute renal failure has shown improvement with a decrease in creatinine levels from 1.8 to 1.5. The urine electrolytes are consistent with an intrarenal etiology.

The patient is currently receiving peptamen 1.5 through a feeding tube and is being monitored closely for any changes in condition. The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Overall, the patient's condition remains complex and requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, currently presenting with acute ETOH necrotizing pancreatitis.
- She has continued fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS.
- The patient has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is expected to require mechanical ventilation for sedation during a planned procedure (LP).
- There are ongoing efforts to manage her elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and fevers, with a suspicion of pancreatitis.
- The patient has been restarted on meropenem due to a shunt, and all cultures remain negative.
- A laparoscopic procedure (LP) has been planned, and if it yields negative results, the meropenem can be discontinued.
- Cultures are being followed, and further tests such as glucan and galactomannan will be conducted.
- The patient's acute pancreatitis has been assessed, and surgery has been deferred with a decision pending on further imaging unless there is a change in clinical status.
- Post-pyloric feeding is being continued, and recommendations regarding further imaging will be sought if the patient's fevers persist.
- The patient is also dealing with hypernatremia, which requires titration of fluid warmers (FWF).
- There are concerns about intrinsic renal disease, as indicated by the elevated fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa).
- The patient's volume status needs to be carefully managed, aiming for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who is currently in the ICU for acute necrotizing pancreatitis. She continues to have fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 111/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on multiple infusions including midazolam, fentanyl, and furosemide. She has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, AKI, volume status issues, hyperglycemia, and sedation concerns. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and lactic acid levels. Imaging and microbiology results are negative. The plan includes continuing to wean sedation, restarting meropenem, obtaining a lumbar puncture, and following cultures. The patient is also being managed for acute pancreatitis, hypernatremia, AKI, volume status, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and oxygen saturation is slightly below normal. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers. There is a possibility of developing a new infection or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, currently admitted to the ICU for acute necrotizing pancreatitis. She continues to have fevers and is improving in terms of respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/86 to 171/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 3,720 mL and output of 5,190 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,470 mL. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema.

Lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 24.1 to 27.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level between 8.8 and 28.1 g/dL, platelet count between 350 and 508 thousand/mm3, creatinine level between 1.5 and 2.0 mg/dL, glucose level ranging from 87 to 191 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 1219 ng/mL.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and significant peri-pancreatic inflammation seen on last scan. The patient has undergone tracheostomy placement and is on invasive ventilation. She is also on multiple medications including furosemide, heparin, and gemfibrozil. 

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure due to ARDS, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, and chronic pancreatitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the respiratory failure, development of central nervous system infections due to the presence of a foreign body, progression of the renal failure, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, further electrolyte imbalances, worsening of the gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, and possible worsening of the anemia."

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia, fever, shock, and chronic pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 120/73 mmHg to 189/108 mmHg, heart rate between 102-121 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask with 40% FiO2.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be overweight and anxious, with symmetric chest expansion, tender epigastric area, bilateral lower extremity edema, and no rashes or neurologic deficits.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23.4 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, abnormal liver function tests, elevated creatinine levels, and altered electrolyte levels.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including invasive ventilation, hemodynamic monitoring, furosemide infusion, prophylactic heparin, and insulin therapy. She is currently on a feeding tube with Peptamen 1.5 at 50 mL/hour.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and significant peri-pancreatic inflammation. The patient has already undergone surgery and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and ciprofloxacin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Given the patient's history of pancreatitis and the presence of a foreign body (NG tube), there is a concern for infection in the pancreas and central nervous system (CNS). Cultures from the lumbar puncture (LP) should be monitored, and fungal markers and cultures should also be followed up.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. The patient had successful tracheostomy placement, but continues to require ventilator support. Weaning off sedation, monitoring vital signs, and conducting daily chest X-rays will be important in managing this condition.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a stable creatinine level of 1.5. Urine electrolytes are consistent with an intrarenal etiology. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and diuretics like lasix may be"

   #Respiratory failure s/p trach.
   - Continue on TM.  [**Month (only) 11**] need vent for sedation during LP.
   - Diuresis
   #Continued elevated WBC and fevers: Most likely pancreatitis.
   Restarted meropenem yesterday b/c of shunt.  All cultures still
   negative.
   - LP today per IR
 if negative, can d/c meropenem
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - F/U glucan / galactomannan
    #Acute pancreatitis: surgery signed off, defer further imaging unless
   change in clinical status.
   - Continue post-pyloric feeding. Will request recs regarding need for
   further imaging if fevers persist
   #Hypernatremia:
   - Titrate FWF
   #AKD: Improving creatinine. Likely instrinsic renal disease. FeNa
   elevated.

She continues to experience fevers and is improving in respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation for sedation during a lumbar puncture.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: Continue on TM and need vent for sedation during LP. 
2. Continued elevated WBC and fevers: Most likely pancreatitis. Restarted meropenem yesterday because of shunt. All cultures still negative.
3. Acute pancreatitis: Surgery signed off, defer further imaging unless change in clinical status.
4. Hypernatremia: Titrate FWF.
5. AKD: Improving creatinine. Likely intrinsic renal disease. FeNa elevated.
6. Volume status: Goal I/O -2L with lasix gtt and metolazone. Concentrate all gtts and switch to D5 carrier when possible.
7. Hyperglycemia: Change from insulin gtt to NPH. Continue to titrate.
8. Sedation: Continue to wean sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further deterioration in respiratory function due to ARDS.
2. Pancreatitis: There is a risk of worsening pancreatitis, leading to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who presented with acute ETOH necrotizing pancreatitis. She continues to have fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's WBC count has been consistently elevated, and she still has fevers. All cultures have been negative, so the source of infection is unclear. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, and efforts are being made to wean her off sedation. 

The patient also has hypernatremia, which is improving with fluid restriction and free water administration. Her AKI is improving, and she is being closely monitored for volume status. 

The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and insulin therapy is being titrated to maintain glycemic control. 

The patient's sedation is being weaned off, and her mental status is improving. She is receiving nutritional support through a feeding tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers, elevated WBC count, and positive CSF analysis indicating the possibility of an ongoing infection. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and repeat cultures as necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory status is improving, there is still a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial, and efforts should be made to gradually"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who presented with acute ethanol necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient continues to have fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. She has been placed on mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy has been performed. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/88 mmHg to 120/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has increased from 93 kg at admission to 108.2 kg.

The patient is receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and haloperidol. She is also receiving nutrition through a peptamen formula at a rate of 50 mL/hour.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her creatinine level is decreasing, and her glucose levels have been fluctuating but mostly within normal range. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, and surgery has been deferred. Imaging will only be pursued if there is a change in clinical status. The patient's hypernatremia is improving with fluid restriction, and her volume status is being managed with lasix and metolazone"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. She has persistent fevers and leukocytosis, with significant peri-pancreatic inflammation seen on last scan. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for 14 days and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute renal failure. She also has hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is being managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and targeted temperature management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection, despite negative cultures. Infections can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or other pathogens.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis. There is significant peri-pancreatic inflammation, which could lead to further complications such as abscess formation or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. This condition can worsen and lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output."

   Assessment and Plan
   42F with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by
   pancreatic necrosis and ARDS.
   Persistent fevers: Most likely [**1-21**] pancreatic inflammation, but need to
   maintain concern for infection.  All cultures negative today and pt
   completed one week course for VAP last week.  Two potential sources of
   concern were pancreas and CNS given foreign body. LP cell count appears
   benign. Gram stain negative.  No overt sign of infection on most recent
   CT abdomen.
   -          No antibiotics for now
   -          f/u cultures from LP
   -          f/u fungal markers and cultures
   -          repeat UA positive; obtain urine culture
   Necrotizing pancreatitis
Surgery has signed off. Fever & leukocytosis
   persist; significant peri-pancreatic inflammation seen on last scan.
   - reconsult surgery if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   - completed 14 days of broad-spectrum ABXs meropenem/cipro.
   - cont TF via NJ
   - insulin SQ
   - cont gemfibrozil for hypertriglyceridemia (although more likely a
   result of pancreatitis than a cause)
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/ARDS :  Patient had successful Trach
   placement.
   - Passy Muir placed yesterday, tolerating well
   - Lasix changed to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow UOP
   Hypernatremia: improved.  Was placed on metolazone
   - d/c metolazone
   - cont to monitor
   Acute Renal Failure: Cr continues to improve, now to 1.1.  Urine lytes
   consistent with intrarenal etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] have been contrast induce
   - continue to monitor

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. She is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for several days.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/71 mmHg to 153/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and high glucose level. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain medications, antacids, and diuretics. She has also been receiving nutrition through a feeding tube.

The patient's physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, tenderness in the epigastric area, and symmetric chest expansion. Neurologically, she is attentive and responding to verbal stimuli, with all extremities moving.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. She has necrotizing pancreatitis, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and requires ongoing management of her ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the pancreatitis, development of infections such as ventilator"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient's speech and swallow evaluation was performed for a speaking valve. The urine analysis (UA) was positive, but antibiotics (abx) were not started yet, only urine culture (UCx) was sent. The patient received an additional 2 mg of oral haloperidol (Haldol) in the afternoon due to delirium and 2 mg of oral hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for back pain.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on 10/28/2132 at 4:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 6 mg per hour, as well as other ICU medications such as pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the abdominal pain. The flow sheet data shows that the patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.1 degrees Celsius, current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 107 beats per minute with a normal range of 91-120 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 125/71 to 153/96 mmHg,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to ARDS. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation levels and ventilatory support as needed.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to various factors such as sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or complications from the pancreatitis. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and neurological signs is essential.

3. Renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and abnormal urine electrolytes. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting fluid and medication administration accordingly is crucial.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has persistent hyperglycemia, which needs to be managed with insulin therapy. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is required to ensure appropriate glycemic control.

5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, specifically hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further complications.

6. Constipation: The patient is at risk of developing constipation due to reduced mobility and medication use. It is important to ensure adequate bowel movement and prevent obstipation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who presented with acute ETOH necrotizing pancreatitis. She continues to have fevers and is improving in her respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving diuretics and has shown improvement in her fluid balance. Her WBC count remains elevated, but all cultures have been negative. The patient's Hct has been trending down, indicating possible anemia. She also has hypernatremia and AKI, which are being managed accordingly. The patient's hyperglycemia is being controlled with insulin. She is currently on a feeding tube and is being monitored for delirium. The patient's current disposition is to be transferred to the floor and potentially start rehabilitation soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and persistent fevers suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Cultures have been negative so far, but it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection.
2. Anemia: The patient's decreasing Hct levels indicate a possible development of anemia. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as seizures or neurological dysfunction.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function indicates the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who presented with acute ethanol necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient continues to have fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation (TM) with a plan to trial partial mechanical ventilation (PMV) today.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and ongoing fevers, which are most likely due to pancreatitis. All cultures remain negative. Further cultures, including CSF culture, will be followed up, as well as testing for glucan and galactomannan. The Foley catheter will be changed due to candiduria, and urine analysis and culture will be rechecked.

Surgery has been deferred for acute pancreatitis, and imaging will only be pursued if there is a change in clinical status. Post-pyloric feeding will continue.

The patient is experiencing anemia, with a decreasing hemoglobin concentration over the past two days. No obvious source of bleeding has been identified.

Hypernatremia is now normal to low, and fluid restriction will be decreased. AKI is improving, and creatinine levels will be continued to be monitored.

Volume status is being managed with goal I/O -2L using lasix and metolazone. Efforts are being made to concentrate all fluids and switch to D5 carrier when possible.

Hyperglycemia is being managed by titrating NPH insulin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis presenting with acute ethanol necrotizing pancreatitis. She has been experiencing continued fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (TM/PMV) and has had a tracheostomy. She is also on diuretics with Lasix gtt to manage fluid balance.

The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has been consistently elevated, and she has had fevers, although she is currently afebrile for 24 hours. All cultures have been negative. The patient is being monitored for further infections with pending CSF and urine cultures.

In terms of management, the patient's acute pancreatitis does not require surgical intervention, and further imaging is deferred unless there is a change in clinical status. She is receiving post-pyloric feeding to support her nutrition.

The patient is experiencing anemia, with a decreasing hematocrit (Hct). There is no obvious source of bleeding, so the cause of the anemia needs to be investigated further. Her sodium levels are also low, and her intake of fluids needs to be adjusted accordingly.

The patient's renal function is improving, and she is being monitored for any changes in kidney function. Her volume status is being closely monitored, with goals of maintaining an output of -1.5L with Lasix gtt and metolazone. The patient is also being managed for hyperglycemia through titration of NPH insulin.

She is experiencing delirium/psychosis, and Haldol is being administered as needed. The patient's delirium will be reassessed with PMV.

The patient's disposition is being planned for rehabilitation and physical therapy (PT/OT). She is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support through Peptamen 1.5 (Full) at 50 mL/hour. Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Restraints for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being reviewed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has had fevers and an elevated WBC count, indicating a possible infection. Further investigations with pending CSF and urine cultures are necessary to identify any potential sources.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and ARDS. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or systemic infection.
4. Anemia: The patient's decreasing Hct suggests anemia, which needs to be investigated and managed appropriately to prevent further complications.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-inch tall and 108.2 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypocalcemia, and chronic pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 120/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide, and antibiotics. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory support and fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and ARDS, there is a potential for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to complications like fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, or the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest a possible infection, which could"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently in the ICU for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia due to blood loss, fever, shock, and chronic pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient had successful tracheostomy placement and is tolerating a Passy-Muir valve well. However, she may still be at risk for further respiratory complications due to her ARDS.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains altered, which could be due to several factors such as sepsis, hypoxia, or direct effects of the underlying condition. Monitoring for any changes in mental status and addressing potential contributing factors is important.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, indicating some improvement in renal function. However, close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte balance is necessary to prevent further renal complications.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy should be continued to manage blood glucose levels and prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia.

5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance"

   42F with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by
   pancreatic necrosis and ARDS.
   Persistent fevers: Most likely [**1-21**] pancreatic inflammation, but need to
   maintain concern for infection.  All cultures negative today and pt
   completed one week course for VAP last week.  Two potential sources of
   concern were pancreas and CNS given foreign body. LP cell count appears
   benign. Gram stain negative.  No overt sign of infection on most recent
   CT abdomen. At this time, pt has been afebrile for 36+ hrs, but it
   should be noted that she has been on standing tylenol throughout this
   time

   -          f/u fungal markers and cultures
   -          repeat UA positive; negative culture
   Increase in Leukocytosis: Given diahrrea and increase in WBC from 25 to
   30 and then 36 within 24hrs, pt started on empiric po vanco. Cdiff tox
   pending.  Doubt any other source of infxn at this time, but pancreas
   and lung should be re-imaged if cdiff negative and no other source
   obvious.
   Necrotizing pancreatitis
Surgery has signed off.  leukocytosis
   persist; significant peri-pancreatic inflammation seen on last scan.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS. She has persistent fevers, but all cultures have been negative so far. She has been on standing Tylenol and has been afebrile for 36 hours. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to ARDS.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, but it is not delirium.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which may be due to stress, pain, or the pancreatitis itself.
5. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia and hypocalcemia.
6. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to decreased mobility and use of Fos.
7. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss from hemorrhage.
8. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, possibly due to pancreatic inflammation or another underlying infection.
9. Shock: The patient is at risk for shock due to hypotension and inadequate tissue perfusion.
10. Pancreatitis: The patient has chronic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and ARDS"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-inch tall male weighing 108.2 kg. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypocalcemia, and chronic pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), blood pressure ranging from 120/68 mmHg to 133/78 mmHg, heart rate between 91-109 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient is on heparin sodium prophylaxis and furosemide (Lasix). The patient's current weight is 108.2 kg, with a change from admission weight of 93 kg.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,617 mL and output of 5,520 mL since midnight, resulting in a negative balance of 2,903 mL. The patient's daily laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 26.2 to 31.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 23.7 to 28.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 491 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 mg/dL, glucose levels between 100 and 145 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances.

The patient has multiple ongoing assessments and plans, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, shock, ARDS, hypocalcemia, and chronic pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure, progression of acute renal failure, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, worsening electrolyte and fluid imbalance, persistent constipation, exacerbation of anemia, persistent fever, development of further shock, deterioration of ARDS, worsening hypocalcemia, and exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, blood glucose levels, electrolyte balance, bowel movements, and mental status. Prompt intervention may be required to prevent or manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, presenting with acute ETOH necrotizing pancreatitis. She has been experiencing continued fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient is currently on TM/PMV ventilation, receiving lasix for diuresis, and post-pyloric feedings. She also has anemia with a decreasing Hct, hypernatremia, AKD (adjusting kidney diet), volume status concerns, hyperglycemia, delirium/psychosis, and potential DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern. She has been improving but still requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration or delayed weaning from the ventilator.

2. Infection: Despite being afebrile for 24 hours, the patient's fever could be attributed to pancreatitis. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of infection, especially considering the ongoing presence of fevers and the negative cultures.

3. Pancreatitis complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to various complications such as pseudocysts, abscesses, or necrosis. Close monitoring for any changes in abdominal status or imaging findings is necessary.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is trending down, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate production. Further evaluation is required to identify the source of bleeding and provide appropriate management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis who presented with acute ethanol necrotizing pancreatitis. She continues to have fevers and is improving in her respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is on TM/PMV. She is being diuresed with lasix. Her WBC count is elevated, but she is now afebrile for 24 hours. Her urine culture came back negative, and she has a pending C. diff test. The patient's Hct has been trending down over the past two days, and there is no obvious source of bleeding. She is on post-pyloric feeding, and further imaging for acute pancreatitis has been deferred unless there is a change in her clinical status. The patient is also being monitored for hypernatremia, AKD (acute kidney disease), volume status, hyperglycemia, and delirium/psychosis. She will be screened for rehab and PT/OT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has continued fevers, and her WBC count is elevated. She is at risk for developing a hospital-acquired infection, particularly since she has been in the ICU for an extended period.
2. Pancreatitis Complications: Given the patient's history of acute ethanol necrotizing pancreatitis, she may develop complications such as pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, or infected necrot"

   Assessment and Plan
   42F (h/o chronic pancreatitis) p/w acute ETOH necrotizing pancreatitis,
   continued fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS.
    #Respiratory failure s/p trach.
   - Continue on TM/PMV.  Defer capping trial given thick secretions.
   - Diuresis with lasix gtt
   #Continued elevated WBC: Now afebrile x 24 hours.  All cultures still
   negative.  WBC count increased from 25 to 30 with diarrhea.
   - Recheck WBC count and send c. diff.  start PO vanc for now.
    #Acute pancreatitis: surgery signed off, defer further imaging unless
   change in clinical status.
   - Continue post-pyloric feeding.
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down over past 2 days. No obvious source of
   bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct, Goal Hct > 21
   - Guaic stools
   - Continue PPI
   #Hypernatremia: Now low with Po intake.
   - D/C FWF
   #AKD: Improving creatinine. Continue to follow.
   #Volume status:
   - Goal I/O -1.5L with lasix gtt and metolazone
   - Concentrate all gtts
   # Hyperglycemia:  Titrate NPH
   #Delerium/Psychosis: Haldol prn. Reasses with PMV.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis presenting with acute ETOH necrotizing pancreatitis. She has been experiencing continued fevers and improving respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has undergone tracheostomy. She has been receiving diuretics, post-pyloric feeding, and prophylactic antibiotics. The patient's WBC count is elevated, and she has been experiencing diarrhea. Her Hct levels are trending down, and there are no obvious sources of bleeding. She also has hypernatremia and improving renal function. The patient's current medications include furosemide, heparin sodium, and NPH. She is being monitored for delirium and psychosis, and her glycemic control is being managed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC count and ongoing fevers, indicating a possible infection. The pending C. diff culture should be considered, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered to prevent or treat any infections.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute ETOH necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, or pancreatic necrosis. Close monitoring and surgical evaluation may be necessary if there is a change in clinical status.

3. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has been experiencing improving respiratory failure/ARDS. Continued monitoring and management of her respiratory status"
