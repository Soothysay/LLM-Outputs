   Assessment and Plan
   80-M s/ MMP incl dementia, CAD, chronic Afib, CHF, CRI, and
   diverticulosis, p/w multiple episodes of BRBPR with dropping Hct and HD
   instability manifesting as hypotension. Received 4units PRBCs, 2units
   FFP, Vit K, 3.5L NS at OSH with continued drop in Hct to 27.4. Gave
   another 2 un pRBCs with increase to 28 followed by an additional 1un to
   HCT of 30.
   #. GI bleeding
 Continued BRBPR with HCT stable at 29-30. Likely
   source is lower, esp. given h/o diverticulosis, but rapid upper source
   cannot be entirely excluded. NG lavage at OSH reportedly negative. CT
   to eval AAA s/p endovascular repair reportedly negative. GI plans to
   scope today, either on the floor or while still in the MICU.  Also,
   seen by Surgery in ED, who feel pt will likely need tagged-RBC scan +/-
   angiography prior to potential scope, however, will hold on this for
   now.
   - serial Hcts q6hrs
   - If Hcts still dropping or evidence of continued bleeding, may
   consider STAT tagged-RBC scan +/- angiography
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - appreciate GI and Surgery recs, cont to follow
   - active type-and-cross

","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including dementia, coronary artery disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, depression, and hyperlipidemia. The patient presented to the emergency department with gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting in a significant drop in hemoglobin levels and hemodynamic instability. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K during resuscitation at the outside hospital. Despite transfusion, the patient's hemoglobin levels continued to drop, necessitating additional transfusion. The patient's INR was elevated on admission but has resolved after receiving FFP and vitamin K. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on telemetry monitoring.

The patient has been started on IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Due to the recent bleeding, antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications have been held. The patient's family has been informed about the situation and the plan to proceed with a tagged-red blood cell scan and/or angiography if the patient continues to bleed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient's presentation and ongoing bleeding indicate a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency, diverticulosis, and depression. The patient presented to the hospital with hemodynamic instability, bradycardia, hypotension, and a dropping hematocrit (Hct) indicating possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He was transfused with 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, and 3.5 liters of normal saline (NS). Despite these interventions, the patient's Hct continued to drop to 30%. The source of bleeding is uncertain, with potential lower GI sources such as diverticulosis and upper GI sources like peptic ulcer disease being considered. The patient underwent negative lavage and CT scans to evaluate for possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and other sources of bleeding. Further diagnostic tests including a tagged-red blood cell scan and angiography may be necessary to identify the source of bleeding. The patient is currently being monitored closely in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple large-bore peripheral intravenous lines, cardiac telemetry, and strict fluid balance monitoring. Medications have been held due to the patient's instability, including antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. The patient's code status is"

   Assessment and Plan
   80-M s/ MMP incl dementia, CAD, chronic Afib, CHF, CRI, and
   diverticulosis, p/w multiple episodes of BRBPR with dropping Hct and HD
   instability manifesting as hypotension. Received 4units PRBCs, 2units
   FFP, Vit K, 3.5L NS at OSH with continued drop in Hct to 27.4. Gave
   another 2 un pRBCs with increase to 28 followed by an additional 1un to
   HCT of 30.
   #. GI bleeding
 Continued BRBPR with HCT stable at 29-30. Likely
   source is lower, esp. given h/o diverticulosis, but rapid upper source
   cannot be entirely excluded. NG lavage at OSH reportedly negative. CT
   to eval AAA s/p endovascular repair reportedly negative. GI plans to
   scope today, either on the floor or while still in the MICU.  Also,
   seen by Surgery in ED, who feel pt will likely need tagged-RBC scan +/-
   angiography prior to potential scope, however, will hold on this for
   now.
   - serial Hcts q6hrs
   - If Hcts still dropping or evidence of continued bleeding, may
   consider STAT tagged-RBC scan +/- angiography

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency, depression, and dementia. The patient presented to the emergency department with a complaint of hypotension and was found to have ongoing bloody bowel preparation (BRBPR) with a decreasing hemoglobin concentration. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, and 3.5 liters of normal saline (NS) at the outside hospital (OSH). Despite these interventions, the patient's hemoglobin concentration continued to drop to 27.4. Another 2 units of PRBCs were transfused, which increased the hemoglobin concentration to 28.0, followed by an additional unit that brought the hemoglobin concentration to 30.0.

The patient is currently in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and is being monitored on telemetry. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals ecchymoses around the peripheral intravenous (PIV) sites,"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including dementia, coronary artery disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, diverticulosis, hyperlipidemia, and depression. The patient presented to the hospital with hemodynamic instability and was found to have a gastrointestinal bleed, likely originating from the lower gastrointestinal tract, possibly due to diverticulosis. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), along with vitamin K, and was given 3.5 liters of normal saline (NS). Despite these interventions, the patient's hematocrit continued to drop to 30%.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 101/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently on telemetry monitoring. The physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, skin is not assessed, and neurologic examination is not performed.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.3%, platelet count of 103 x 10^9/L, creatinine of 1"

   #. Dispo - ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diverticulosis, and depression. The patient presented with episodes of bloody bowel movements (BRBPR), and further evaluation is needed to determine the source of bleeding. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been dropping, and he received blood transfusions to maintain a stable level above 30.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient's BRBPR may indicate an ongoing lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, possibly related to his history of diverticulosis. However, an upper GI source cannot be entirely ruled out. The negative NG lavage suggests that the lower GI tract is likely the source of bleeding. Further diagnostic tests such as a tagged-RBC scan and/or angiography may be necessary to identify the specific site of bleeding.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated INR upon admission, which improved after receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The cause of the elevated INR is unclear, and the patient's coagulation status should continue to be monitored with serial coagulation tests. FFP may be transfused as needed if the INR remains above 1.5.

3. CAD: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   80-M s/ MMP incl dementia, CAD, chronic Afib, CHF, CRI, and
   diverticulosis, p/w multiple episodes of BRBPR with dropping Hct and HD
   instability manifesting as hypotension. Received 4units PRBCs, 2units
   FFP, Vit K, 3.5L NS at OSH with continued drop in Hct to 27.4. Gave
   another 2 un pRBCs with increase to 28 followed by an additional 1un to
   HCT of 30.
   #. GI bleeding
 Continued BRBPR with HCT stable at 29-30. Likely
   source is lower, esp. given h/o diverticulosis, but rapid upper source
   cannot be entirely excluded. NG lavage at OSH reportedly negative. CT
   to eval AAA s/p endovascular repair reportedly negative. GI plans to
   scope today, either on the floor or while still in the MICU.  Also,
   seen by Surgery in ED, who feel pt will likely need tagged-RBC scan +/-
   angiography prior to potential scope, however, will hold on this for
   now.
   - serial Hcts q6hrs
   - If Hcts still dropping or evidence of continued bleeding, may
   consider STAT tagged-RBC scan +/- angiography

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of multiple comorbidities, including dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency, depression, and hyperlipidemia. The patient presented to the hospital with an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), resulting in significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability. He required a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to stabilize his condition. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 94/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient is suspected to have lower gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to diverticulosis. However, an upper source cannot be entirely excluded. NG lavage at the outside hospital was negative, and a CT scan to evaluate for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) after endovascular repair was also negative. The patient will undergo a colonoscopy today to identify the source of bleeding. If the Hct continues to drop or there is evidence of continued bleeding, a tagged-red blood cell scan +/- angiography may be considered.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR"

   #. Dispo - ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including dementia, coronary artery disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, depression, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and unstable vital signs. The patient underwent several interventions including blood product transfusions, fluid resuscitation, and administration of vitamin K. He has a history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery and stents, but is not currently taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications. The patient's INR has resolved to 1.2, and he is now being monitored with serial coagulation tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is suspected to have lower gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to diverticulosis. However, an upper source cannot be entirely excluded. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been dropping, leading to transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Further investigations such as a tagged-red blood cell scan and angiography may be required to identify the source of bleeding.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated INR on admission, which has since resolved to 1.2 after receiving FFP and vitamin K. Continuous monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary to prevent further coagulation abnormalities.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of multiple comorbidities including dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diverticulosis, and depression. The patient presented to the emergency department with gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) manifesting as bloody bowel movements and hematochezia. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level dropped to 27.4, and he received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, and 3.5 liters of normal saline (NS) at the outside hospital (OSH). Despite these interventions, the patient's Hct continued to drop to 28, followed by an additional unit of pRBCs which increased the Hct to 30. The patient's coagulopathy has resolved, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. However, the cause of the elevated INR on admission is unclear. The patient is currently not taking aspirin or clopidogrel, which are antiplatelet medications.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 94/56 mmHg to 126/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency, depression, hyperlipidemia, and diverticulosis. The patient presented to the emergency department with episodes of bloody bowel preparation (BRBPR) and a dropping hematocrit (Hct). He received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, and 3.5 liters of normal saline (NS) at the outside hospital (OSH). Despite this, his Hct continued to drop to 27.4, and another 2 units of PRBCs were transfused with an increase to Hct of 28. An additional unit of PRBCs was given to achieve a stable Hct of 30.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing BRBPR suggests an ongoing lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely related to his history of diverticulosis. The negative nasogastric (NG) lavage and computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis make an upper GI source less likely, but rapid upper sources cannot be entirely excluded. The plan is to perform a colonoscopy to evaluate and potentially treat the source of bleeding.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and bronchorestrictive breathing pattern (BRBRP). He required 2 units of blood overnight and continues to have red stools, with no change in hemoglobin (Hct) after the first unit. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, normal blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm. His fluid balance shows a total input of 2666 mL, with a total output of 2405 mL. The patient has received proton pump inhibitor (PPI), zoloft, lipitor, and nemenda. There are no significant changes in the patient's medical and family history, review of systems, or physical examination findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient continues to have red stools, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction if not managed appropriately.
2. Heart failure (CHF): The patient's history of congestive heart failure (CHF) may contribute to his current condition. Fluid overload and inadequate cardiac output can result in pulmonary edema, decreased urine output, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is currently in AF rhythm. If left untreated, it can lead to poor tissue perf"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diverticulosis, and depression. The patient presented with episodes of bloody fluid in the stool, which suggests a possible lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) was stable at around 30, but there were episodes of hemodynamic instability manifesting as hypotension, requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBC).

The patient also has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, cardiac stents, and is currently not taking aspirin or Plavix. The patient has a pacemaker in place for rate control in AF. The patient's coagulopathy has resolved after receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline 2 to 1.7, indicating worsening renal function.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/66 to 126/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) for a scope and bowel prep. The patient's"

The patient presented with multiple episodes of bloody fluid per rectum (BRBPR) and is suspected to have a lower gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to diverticulosis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has been dropping but is currently stable at 29-30%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.9Â°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.4, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.1%, platelet count of 108,000/mmÂ³, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 25 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, glucose of 134 mg/dL, and sodium of 134 mEq/L. Coagulation studies reveal a"

","The patient is a 80-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diverticulosis, and a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that has been repaired endovascularly. The patient presented with multiple episodes of bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and hemodynamic instability, requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is currently stable at around 30%. 

The patient has a history of CAD with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and placement of cardiac stents. He is currently not taking aspirin or Plavix as per his medication list, and it is unclear why. 

The patient also has chronic AF, which is being rate-controlled with beta-blockers (BB), but he is not on any anti-coagulation therapy. 

The patient has a history of CHF, but the ejection fraction (EF) is unknown. He is maintained on BB and ACE inhibitors at home. 

The patient had a CT scan at the outside hospital to evaluate the endovascular repair of his AAA, which was negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including diverticulosis, chronic renal failure, chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible coronary artery disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to a likely diverticular bleed that has since stopped. The patient's hemoglobin level is now stable. The patient also has a polyp that requires follow-up.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and an increased respiratory rate. The patient is on several medications, including proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and diuretics. The patient's lab results indicate some abnormalities, such as elevated creatinine levels and slightly low potassium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: The patient had a likely diverticular bleed, which has stopped for now. However, there is a risk of rebleeding or developing other GI complications.

2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are elevated. This indicates impaired kidney function, which may lead to further complications like fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

3. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, as evidenced by crackles on examination. This condition can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath or fluid retention.

4. Atrial Fibrillation:"
