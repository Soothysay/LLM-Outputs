   Assessment and Plan
   /P: 80 yo F with a new diagnosis small cell lung cancer on chemotherapy
   for less than 24 hours, transferred to the ICU with progressive
   hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia. Very large A-a gradient. Multiple possible etiologies. The
   patient has a large mediastinal soft tissue mass causing RLL collapse.
   Further airway compression/obstruction is possible as is further
   external compression of pulmonary arteries. A PE is possible given
   reports of SVC invasion with associated thrombus and malignancy
   associated hypercoagulability. This would further be supported by
   tachycardia. Pulmonary edema is possible given reports of likely
   positive fluid balance since entering the hospital though CXR and exam
   seem less suggestive of significant edema. A medication effect of
   chemotherapy is possible due to recent initiation of therapy.
   Infectious cause seems unlikely given that the patient is afebrile with
   a normal WBC. Compression and atelectasis from bilateral pleural
   effusions may also be contributing.
   - For compression/obstruction of vasculature and airways: Continue
   chemotherapy, radiation-oncology consult regarding possible XRT.
   - For possible PE: To consider empiric systemic anticoagulation, CTA if
   patient is able to tolerate study
   - For possible fluid overload: Maintain negative fluid balance as blood
   pressure tolerates, goal -1L
   - For possible medication effect: Continue to monitor.
   - For possible infectious etiology: Culture for any fever spike.
   - For component of compression due to pleural effusions: To consider
   thoracentesis on the right side.
   - Ipratropium and albuterol nebs.
   - Discussed with the patient, will intubate if necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxia. She has been on chemotherapy for less than 24 hours. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/64 mmHg to 121/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's physical examination reveals dullness to percussion at the bases bilaterally and absent breath sounds on the right lower lobe. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Imaging shows right lower lobe collapse with bilateral effusions, which has not significantly changed since the previous chest x-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates inadequate oxygenation. This could be due to various causes such as airway compression/obstruction, external compression of pulmonary arteries, pulmonary edema, medication effect of chemotherapy, or infectious etiology.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the reports of superior vena cava (SVC) invasion with associated thrombus and malignancy-associated hypercoagulability, there is a possibility of a PE. Tachycardia further supports this possibility.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxia. She has been started on ceftriaxone and flagyl for possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The chemotherapy session was held due to poor urine output, and intravenous fluids were given. The patient has multiple allergies, including sulfa, prednisone, tetanus, and paroxetine. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current hypoxia. The flow sheet data shows tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased urine output. The patient has bilateral effusions and right lower lobe collapse on the chest X-ray. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns include hypoxia with a large A-a gradient due to a large mediastinal soft tissue mass causing right middle and lower lobe collapse. There is a possibility of further airway compression/obstruction as well as external compression of pulmonary arteries. The plan includes deferring further chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer due to the patient's tenuous respiratory status and the need for large volumes of fluids with chemotherapy. The patient will receive ipratropium and albuterol nebs for respiratory support. The family will be discussed further goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU with progressive hypoxia. The patient is currently on chemotherapy and requires large volumes of fluids, which is concerning due to her tenuous respiratory status. The patient has a large mediastinal soft tissue mass causing collapse of the right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL), leading to further airway compression/obstruction and external compression of pulmonary arteries. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has a high heart rate and low oxygen saturation. She is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and bronchodilators. Her past medical history includes depression, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She is currently not a candidate for further chemotherapy and may require palliative radiation therapy. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is expected to remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and there is a risk of further airway compression/obstruction due to the large mediastinal mass. This could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Fluid overload: The patient requires large volumes of fluids for chemotherapy, which may result in fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized in the ICU, she"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. She was transferred to the ICU due to progressive hypoxia and is currently on chemotherapy. Her current condition is tenuous, and it has been decided to hold further chemotherapy due to concerns about worsening respiratory status and the need for large volume fluid administration. The patient is not a candidate for intravenous chemotherapy and palliative radiation therapy is being considered. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation with high flow nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further airway compression/obstruction: The large mediastinal mass causing collapse of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe may lead to further obstruction, which could compromise the patient's airway and breathing.
2. External compression of pulmonary arteries: The mediastinal mass can also cause external compression of the pulmonary arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the affected lungs and potential hypoxia.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's tenuous respiratory status and the need for large volume fluid administration during chemotherapy may increase the risk of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
4. Chemotherapy toxicity: The patient is currently receiving chemotherapy, and there is a risk of chemotherapy-related toxicities, such as bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, or allergic reactions.
5. Infection: As the patient is in the ICU, she is at increased risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Thromboembolic events: Due to immobility and malignancy, the patient is at an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and her condition may worsen due to the stress of illness and chemotherapy.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and her mental health may be further compromised by her current medical condition.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual medical condition and potential complications may vary."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). She has metastatic disease with invasion into the superior vena cava (SVC) and was admitted to the ICU with progressive hypoxia. The patient tolerated etoposide and cisplatin well and has shown improved urinary output. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/48-165/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the worsening atelectasis in the left lower lobe, which could potentially lead to consolidation. The physical examination reveals crackles in the left lower lobe and absent peripheral pulses. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2, hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL, platelet count of 312,000/mm3, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 112-125 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, which has spread to the superior vena cava (SVC). She was admitted to the ICU with progressive hypoxia. The patient received chemotherapy last night and has shown some improvement in urine output. However, she has a history of unknown allergies to sulfa, prednisone, and tetanus, as well as psychosis with Pail (paroxetine Hcl).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/64 mmHg to 165/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her rhythm is sinus.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,336 mL and output of 1,450 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 886 mL. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG result of ///32.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with PERRL eyes and normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs detected. She has bilateral peripheral pulses present and symmetric chest expansion. Crackles are heard in the left lower lobe, while breath sounds are absent at the right base. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. She has been on chemotherapy for less than 24 hours and was transferred to the ICU with progressive hypoxia. The patient tolerated chemotherapy well and is currently being monitored for respiratory status and cell counts. She is now requiring less oxygen and is on a FiO2 of 40-60%. The plan is to continue monitoring respiratory status and if able to lie flat, she may be a candidate for XRT. Pain control with vicodin and lorazepam for symptomatic treatment are also being administered. The patient has a very large A-a gradient due to a large mediastinal soft tissue mass causing right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL) collapse. Further airway compression/obstruction is possible as is further external compression of pulmonary arteries. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the large mediastinal mass causing RML and RLL collapse, there is a possibility of further airway compression/obstruction, leading to respiratory distress or failure.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's progressive hypoxia indicates inadequate oxygenation, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Maintaining a negative fluid balance as blood pressure tolerates is essential.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. She was transferred to the ICU with progressive hypoxia. The patient tolerated chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide well. She has a history of depression, hypothyroidism, and hypoxia due to a large mediastinal mass causing right middle and lower lobe collapse. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a high A-a gradient indicating significant oxygenation difficulties. The patient has multiple medical conditions and is on various medications for prophylaxis, pain control, and symptomatic treatment. She has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status and is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and high A-a gradient indicate potential respiratory failure. This can be further complicated by the external compression of pulmonary arteries and airway obstruction caused by the large mediastinal mass.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating a risk of fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening hypoxia.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylactic heparin to prevent DVT. However, she has multiple risk factors for developing DVT, including immobility and malignancy.

4. Stress ulcers: The patient is on a stress"

   Critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with small cell lung cancer, experiencing bronchial compression and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. They received chemotherapy last night and are currently being monitored for their ability to tolerate radiation therapy. The patient still requires high-flow oxygen and is showing signs of improvement in terms of dyspnea but has poor oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to bronchial compression and SVC syndrome, which can lead to compromised airflow and oxygenation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's vital signs indicate potential infection with an elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. Additionally, their white blood cell count is within the normal range.
3. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which could be related to chemotherapy or an underlying infection. Close monitoring for Clostridium difficile infection is necessary.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, have been initiated.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate precautions should be taken to minimize this risk.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant deficit, indicating the need for careful fluid management to prevent further complications.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently low, requiring close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent hypoglycemic events."
