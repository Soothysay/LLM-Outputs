   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with back pain, shortness of breath (SOB), and fever. She was found to have pneumonia on a CT scan. The patient requires a high level of oxygen but is otherwise stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's high oxygen requirement indicates respiratory distress, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation of the tissues. This can result in symptoms such as confusion, cyanosis, and organ dysfunction.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's fever and hypoxia are likely caused by pneumonia. If not treated promptly and effectively, pneumonia can progress to more severe symptoms, complications such as sepsis, and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure.

3. Atelectasis: The patient may have significant atelectasis due to pain and splinting. Atelectasis refers to the collapse of a part or all of a lung, which can impair gas exchange and lead to further respiratory distress.

4. Cholecystitis: The patient's back pain radiating to the right upper quadrant raises concern for cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder. If left untreated, cholecystitis can progress to more severe complications such as gallbladder rupture or peritonitis.

5. Kidney stones: Although the patient's urinalysis is negative, kidney"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with back pain, shortness of breath, and fever. She was found to have pneumonia on a CT scan. The patient requires high oxygen levels but is relatively stable.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia (PNA), which is causing her fever and difficulty breathing. An arterial blood gas (ABG) test should be obtained to monitor oxygen levels. Oxygen support will be provided, and the dosage will be adjusted to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. BiPAP/FM/FTent may be considered if the patient requires more oxygen.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The most likely cause of the patient's pneumonia is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This is also the probable cause of her back pain. Antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin should be initiated, along with supplemental oxygen. Culture data should be followed up on, as the patient is not producing sputum.
3. Pain: The patient's back pain is likely due to her pneumonia, particularly since it is located in an area consistent with pneumonia and there are signs of diaphragmatic irritation. There is concern for cholecystitis, but the CT scan was negative. Other possible causes include epidural abscess, but it does not appear to be present on the CT scan"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with back pain, shortness of breath, and fever. She was found to have pneumonia on the CT scan. The patient requires high levels of oxygen but is currently stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, which is likely due to pneumonia. It is important to continue supporting her respiratory status with oxygen and consider BiPAP if necessary. A low threshold for intubation should be maintained.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): Pneumonia is the most likely cause of the patient's fever and hypoxia. The CT scan showed patchy multifocal airspace opacity, worse in the right lower lobe, consistent with infection and mild pulmonary edema. Repeat ABG and follow up on the final CT read.
3. Back pain: The patient's back pain is most likely related to her pneumonia. It is located in an area consistent with the picture of pneumonia, and she also shows evidence of diaphragmatic irritation. Perform RUQ ultrasound if pain persists.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, possibly due to her medical condition or chronic disease. Consider adding iron for long-term management.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits. Continue on home medications for hypertension.
6. Potential complications of pneumonia treatment: As the patient is receiving antibiotics, there is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with back pain, shortness of breath, and fever. She has been found to have pneumonia on a CT scan. The patient requires high oxygen support but is fairly stable. The most likely cause of her hypoxia is pneumonia, which is also the most likely cause of her fever. Other possible complications include atelectasis from splinting due to pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's high oxygen requirement suggests respiratory distress, which can be a result of pneumonia. Ensuring adequate oxygenation is crucial.
2. Pneumonia (CAP): The CT scan shows likely pneumonia, and the patient's symptoms are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Antibiotics have been started, but close monitoring and follow-up of culture data are necessary.
3. Pain: The patient's back pain is likely due to pneumonia. The CT scan was negative for dissection, but further evaluation of liver function tests and RUQ ultrasound may be needed to rule out cholecystitis or other causes.
4. Anemia: Chronic anemia is noted, and iron supplementation may be required for long-term management.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, and she should continue on her home medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who was admitted with pneumonia (fevers, hypoxia), back pain, and anemia. The patient has been experiencing multi-focal pneumonia, high oxygen requirements, and ongoing back pain. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.2 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/60 to 139/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 6 liters of oxygen via a face tent.

The patient's blood cultures showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, which is concerning for Streptococcus infection. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a normal pH level of 7.41, elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg, normal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 65 mmHg, and an A-a gradient of 27. The ABG also shows a FiO2 of 0.65.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain control with hydromorphone, and prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis. Other medications include regular insulin for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor.

The patient's condition has been improving since admission, but they still have high oxygen requirements and ongoing back pain contributing to splinting, which is causing hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. The patient has multi-focal pneumonia on CT chest, which is likely the cause of the presenting symptoms. Coverage will be changed to Levofloxacin/Contao pending sensitivities, as the blood culture shows growth of GPC in pairs and chains, most concerning for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
2. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be considered to help with volumes and oxygenation.
3. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble study should be ordered to assess shunt/PFO.
4. The patient remains in atrial fibrillation since admission.
5. The back pain is likely due to diaphragmatic irritation from the infiltrate/pleurisy. Pain control will be provided with hydromorphone, gentle valium, lidocaine patch, and NSAID for the inflammatory component from pleurisy.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 203**] [**Known lastname 201**] is a 53 yo woman with h/o HTN who presents with back pain,
   SOB and fever who was found to have pneumonia on CT scan.  Patient has
   high O2 requirement but fairly stable.
   # Hypoxia:  The CTA of her chest was negative for PE, but did show
   likely PNA.  PNA is the most likely cause of her fever and hypoxia. She
   has also had significant pain and may have a significant amount of
   atelectasis from splinting.
   -repeat ABG.
   -will support resp status with oxygen -- currently mantaining SpO2 > 92
   on 6L NC; consider BiPAP if patient requiring more O2, low threshold
   for intubation
   -titrate O2 to keep sats >90%
   -fup on final CT read.
   # PNA:  Most likely cause for hypoxia and back pain.  No hx of PNA.
   -[**2192-6-23**]  Blood cx: Group B Strept.
   - Will d/c ceftriaxone and azithromycin, will continue levoquin for
   atypical coverage
   - Start Penicillin G [**2-7**] million units q4h IV x 10 days.
   -  Order PICC line for ten days of treatment
   - supplement O2.
   # Pain: The patient's back pain is most likely r/t her pneumonia.  it
   is located in an area consistent with that picture and she does seem to
   have evidence of diaphragmatic irritation.  The CT was neg for
   Dissection.  The pain radiates around to the RUQ -- there is some
   concern for a cholecystitis.  We were also concerned about kidney
   stones but her U/A is negative x2. Other possibilities include epidural
   abscess -- does not appear to be present on CT and no neurological
   deficits.
   - Perform RUQ U/S if pain persists.
   -tylenol & hydromorphone PRN.
   .
   # Hypertension - good bp here.
   continue on home medications.  patient typically takes q afternoon.
   -atenolol, HCTZ, lisinopril, nifedipine
   # Anemia - chronic
   -consider adding Fe for long term management.  patient constipated
   currently so hold off for now.
   # FEN:
   -regular diet after obtaining ABG
   -low K -- replete PRN.
   # Prophylaxis: increase bowel regimen, Hep SQ, recheck glucose and
   consider ISS.
   # Access: 1 PIV - obtain PICC line

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with back pain, shortness of breath, and fever. She was found to have pneumonia on a CT scan and has a high oxygen requirement but is fairly stable.

The patient's 24-hour events include growing Group B Strep, and her antibiotics were changed to penicillin G and levofloxacin. She also has allergies to tetracycline, Robitussin, and Flexeril.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.3°C, current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 70 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 125/79 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on a nasal cannula. Her ABG results show pH levels of 7.45 and 7.41, pCO2 levels of 45 and 48 mmHg, pO2 levels of 54 and 65 mmHg, HCO3 levels of 32 and 31 mEq/L, and base excess levels of 6 and 4 mEq/L.

The patient has the following lab results: white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.7-11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.4-30.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 286-318 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 34-31 mEq/L, glucose level of 139-104 mg/dL, and calcium level of 9.2 mg/dL.

Imaging shows a chest X-ray from June 24th with no significant change from previous imaging, and the CT scan showed likely pneumonia but negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). Microbiology results indicate Group B Strep in the blood cultures.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxia, pneumonia, and back pain. For hypoxia, the plan is to repeat ABG, support respiratory status with oxygen, consider BiPAP if needed, and titrate O2 to keep saturation above 90%. For pneumonia, the plan is to follow up on the final CT read, start penicillin G 2-7 million units q4h IV x 10 days, and order a PICC line for ten days of treatment. For back pain, the plan is to perform a RUQ ultrasound if pain persists, provide pain relief with Tylenol and hydromorphone PRN, and consider other possibilities such as cholecystitis or epidural abscess.

Other plans include continuing home medications for hypertension, considering iron supplementation for anemia, maintaining a"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 203**] [**Known lastname 201**] is a 53 yo woman with h/o HTN who presents with back pain,
   SOB and fever who was found to have pneumonia on CT scan.  Patient has
   high O2 requirement but fairly stable.
   # Hypoxia:  The CTA of her chest was negative for PE, but did show
   likely PNA.  PNA is the most likely cause of her fever and hypoxia. She
   has also had significant pain and may have a significant amount of
   atelectasis from splinting.
   -repeat ABG.
   -will support resp status with oxygen -- currently mantaining SpO2 > 92
   on 6L NC; consider BiPAP if patient requiring more O2, low threshold
   for intubation
   -titrate O2 to keep sats >90%

   - Start Penicillin G [**2-7**] million units q4h IV  (day [**1-15**])
   -  Order PICC line for ten days of treatment
 patient
s blood cx from
   yesterday were pos.  will reculture today and plan for PICC tomorrow.
   - supplement O2
 wean as tolerated.
   # Pain: The patient's back pain is most likely r/t her pneumonia, but
   it is persistent and worrisome for some other process.   it is located
   in an area consistent with that picture and she does seem to have
   evidence of diaphragmatic irritation.  The CT was neg for Dissection.
   The pain radiates around to the RUQ -- there is some concern for a
   cholecystitis.  We were also concerned about kidney stones but her U/A
   is negative x2. Other possibilities include epidural abscess -- does
   not appear to be present on CT and no neurological deficits.
   -f-up re: final results for RUQ U/S.
   -obtain MRI to r/o epidural abscess.
   -do more complete neuro exam.
   -tylenol & hydromorphone PRN.
   # Group B strep bacteremia
 most likely source is lungs however, we
   are concerned about other possible sources so will investigate possible
   epidural abscess as well as endocarditis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with back pain, shortness of breath, and fever. She was found to have pneumonia on a CT scan and requires high oxygen levels but is otherwise stable. The patient has grown Group B Strep in blood cultures and her antibiotics have been changed to penicillin G and levofloxacin. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/79 to 140/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has crackles in the right base on lung examination. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 104 mg/dL and 148 mg/dL. Imaging reveals a large hemangioma and small hemangioma in the liver with no biliary dilation. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's pneumonia is the most likely cause of her fever and hypoxia. She will be supported with oxygen and BiPAP if necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has likely pneumonia as well, which is causing her back pain. Blood cultures positive for Group B Strep will be rechecked, and the patient will be started"

   53 yo woman with h/o HTN who presents with back pain, SOB and fever who
   was found to have pneumonia on CT scan.  Patient has high O2
   requirement but fairly stable.
   # Hypoxia:  The CTA of her chest was negative for PE, but did show
   likely PNA.  PNA is the most likely cause of her fever and hypoxia. She
   has also had significant pain and may have a significant amount of
   atelectasis from splinting.
   -repeat ABG.
   -will support resp status with oxygen -- currently mantaining SpO2 > 92
   on 6L NC; consider BiPAP if patient requiring more O2, low threshold
   for intubation
   -titrate O2 to keep sats >90%
   -fup on final CT read.
   # PNA:  Most likely cause for hypoxia and back pain.  No hx of PNA.
   -[**6-23**] & [**6-24**]  Blood cx: Group B Strept.
   - Will d/c levoquin today
   - Start Penicillin G [**2-7**] million units q4h IV  (day [**1-15**])
   -  Order PICC line for ten days of treatment
 patient
s blood cx from
   yesterday were pos.  will reculture today and plan for PICC tomorrow.
   - supplement O2
 wean as tolerated.
   # Pain: The patient's back pain is most likely r/t her pneumonia, but
   it is persistent and worrisome for some other process.   it is located
   in an area consistent with that picture and she does seem to have
   evidence of diaphragmatic irritation.  The CT was neg for Dissection.
   The pain radiates around to the RUQ -- there is some concern for a
   cholecystitis.  We were also concerned about kidney stones but her U/A
   is negative x2. Other possibilities include epidural abscess -- does
   not appear to be present on CT and no neurological deficits.
   -f-up re: final results for RUQ U/S.
   -obtain MRI to r/o epidural abscess.
   -do more complete neuro exam.
   -tylenol & hydromorphone PRN.
   # Group B strep bacteremia
 most likely source is lungs however, we
   are concerned about other possible sources so will investigate possible
   epidural abscess as well as endocarditis
   -fup TTE
   -MRI for epidural abscess
   .
   # Hypertension
 good control here.
   continue on home medications.  patient typically takes q afternoon.
   -atenolol, HCTZ, lisinopril, nifedipine
   # Anemia - chronic
   -consider adding Fe for long term management.  patient constipated
   currently so hold off for now.
   # FEN:
   -regular diet after obtaining ABG
   -low K -- replete PRN.
   # Prophylaxis: increase bowel regimen, Hep SQ, recheck glucose and
   consider ISS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with back pain, shortness of breath (SOB), and fever. She was found to have pneumonia on a CT scan. The patient has a high oxygen requirement but is fairly stable. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia (PNA). She has been given oxygen support and will continue to maintain SpO2 > 92 on 6L NC. BiPAP may be considered if the patient requires more oxygen, with a low threshold for intubation.
2. PNA: Pneumonia is the most likely cause of her fever and hypoxia. The patient's back pain may also be related to pneumonia, as well as atelectasis from splinting.
3. Pain: The patient's back pain is persistent and could be due to pneumonia, diaphragmatic irritation, or cholecystitis. An MRI is needed to rule out an epidural abscess, and a RUQ ultrasound should be done.
4. Group B strep bacteremia: The source of the bacteremia is likely the lungs, but other sources such as an epidural abscess or endocarditis should also be investigated.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled and she should continue on her home medications.
6. Anemia: Chronic anemia should be managed with iron"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with difficult-to-control hypertension presenting with GBS bacteremia and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) as the most likely cause of hypoxia and back pain. There is no history of previous pneumonia. The patient's blood cultures from yesterday were positive for Group B Streptococcus. It is planned to start Penicillin G 2 million units per hour IV for ten days, and a PICC line will be ordered for treatment. The patient's back pain is persistent and may be related to her pneumonia or another process. There is concern for cholecystitis due to RUQ pain radiating around the area. Other possibilities include an epidural abscess, but it does not appear to be present on the CT scan, and there are no neurological deficits. An MRI will be obtained to rule out an epidural abscess. The patient's hypertension is suboptimally controlled, and she will be restarted on nifedipine CR. The patient is currently on a regular diet, and her code status is full code. She is stable for transfer to the floor."

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with difficult-to-control hypertension who presented with GBS bacteremia and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) as the likely source of the GBS bacteremia. There are no vegetations seen on TTE, and an ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) showed only hemangiomas, no abscess.

The patient's back pain is persistent and worrisome for another process, possibly related to the pneumonia. It is located in an area consistent with diaphragmatic irritation. The CT scan was negative for dissection, but there is concern for cholecystitis due to the pain radiating to the RUQ. Kidney stones have been ruled out with a negative urinalysis.

Other possibilities include an epidural abscess, which does not appear to be present on the CT scan and no neurological deficits are observed. An MRI is planned to rule out an epidural abscess, and a more complete neuro exam will be performed.

The patient's hypertension is suboptimally controlled, and nifedipine CR has been restarted. The patient is to continue with her home regimen.

Prophylactic medications include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis is not indicated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with difficult-to-control hypertension who presented with GBS bacteremia and hypoxia. The patient's oxygen requirement has been diminishing, and a CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, but there is a probable pneumonia. The patient's hypoxia is likely due to splinting and resultant atelectasis, as well as hypoventilation caused by their habitus. The trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal any ASD/PFO, making it unlikely that diffusion abnormality is contributing to the hypoxia.

The likely source of the GBS bacteremia is pneumonia, and no vegetations were seen on the TTE. A right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S) showed only hemangiomas, with no abscess. The patient will continue on penicillin G and will need a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Surveillance cultures will also be obtained.

The patient's back pain has an unclear etiology, but it is suspected to be musculoskeletal in nature. The pain does not appear to be related to any pulmonary process, and there is no pleuritic component. Imaging has not revealed any gastrointestinal or genitourinary cause. A CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection, and no hepatobiliary disease was apparent on the RUQ U/S. The patient will be given dilaudid"
