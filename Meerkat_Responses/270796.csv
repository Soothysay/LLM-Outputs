   Total time spent:  35 minutes, patient is critically ill
","The patient is admitted to the MICU with bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The patient has been placed on invasive ventilation and a midline catheter was started. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/62 mmHg to 147/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on assisted ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided, but the ventilator settings indicate the patient is receiving controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist.

Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, no crackles, and paradoxical chest expansion. The patient has bilateral upper and lower extremity weakness. Neurologic examination is not fully assessed. The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 31.0%. The assessment and plan include bronchial and chest CT to identify the source of hemoptysis, as no obvious source was found on ENT scope. The respiratory failure is chronic, and the current ventilator settings will be continued. ALS (advanced life support) measures will be restarted, including home medications."

","Summary:
The patient was admitted to the MICU with bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The patient has been placed on invasive ventilation and a midline catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/62 mmHg to 147/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral upper and lower extremity weakness, but no other significant abnormalities. Lab results show a hemoglobin level of 31.0%. The patient is being managed for hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and ALS (not specified whether it stands for ""artificial life support"" or ""amyotrophic lateral sclerosis""). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's prolonged stay on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia, which can be confirmed by the presence of fever, increased white blood cell count, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray.
2. Ventilator-associated events: The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and"

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/62 to 147/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) settings. The patient's physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular and peripheral vascular findings, but they have absent right and left distal pulses. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the extremities show biceps and triceps weakness. The patient's Hct level is 31.0%, indicating anemia. The assessment and plan include investigating the cause of hemoptysis, continuing ventilator settings, restarting home medications, and further plans according to the resident's note. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing chronic respiratory failure, which may worsen due to the ongoing need for ventilator support.
2. Bleeding: Despite the absence of an obvious source of upper airway bleed, the patient continues to experience bleeding from the tracheostomy site. Further investigation is necessary to identify the cause and prevent further bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOTENSION: patient mentating well with good pulses. Concerned this is
   the effect of sedating/pain medication on patient - accumulating. WBC
   elevated today, likely due to manipulation of trach yesterday, cannot
   r/o infection. Will place smaller cuff on patient.
   - IVFs as needed and restart tube feeds
   - CXR
   - blood cultures
   - sputum cx
   - urine cx
   - stop fentanyl
   BLEEDING IN THROAT/UPPER AIRWAY
   Mr [**Known lastname 4118**] has had distressing bleeding which is evidently from his trach
   site and most likely associated with the attempt to resize the
   tracheostomy tube. The bleeding is problem[**Name (NI) 595**] for several reasons:
   first, the blood loss itself; second, the possibility that blood will
   increasingly fill areas of the lung; third, the extent to which it
   represents a process that endangers his trach tube. Bronchoscopy showed
   bleeding coming from around trach. ENT visualized site and used silver
   nitrate cautery, unable to visualize completely source of bleeding. HCT
   remains stable. Patient continues to have blood secretions, although no
   oral secretions
 he is likely still oozing, no large re-bleed
   - follow serial Hcts
   - monitor for signs of rebleed, if rebleeds needs to go to OR with ENT
   for exploration
   - monitor secretions
   ALS
   Stable on current vent settings. Appears to be comfortable on this.
   Would not make significant changes unless patient decompensates for
   some reason.
   -  continue home Rilutek
   - wife to bring in CoQ
   ANXIETY
   Takes seroquel at home which he and his wife agree helps him stay calm
   and breathe better.  Patient was started on fentanyl boluses for
   sedation.
   - continue Seroquel

   GOALS OF CARE
   Patient appears to have not entirely intentionally ended up on vent as
   the latter aspect of his ALS care. See below re decision to become DNR.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who presented to the ICU with bleeding at the tracheostomy site. The bleeding was likely caused by the attempt to resize the tracheostomy tube. The patient has been experiencing hypotension overnight, which responded to intravenous fluids but remained low. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/54 mmHg to 157/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient has decreased breath sounds with crackles at the lung bases. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion and reduced oxygen delivery to vital organs. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly addressed.
2. Bleeding: The ongoing bleeding from the tracheostomy site poses a risk of continued blood loss and potential airway compromise. It is essential to monitor the patient closely for signs of rebleeding and take appropriate measures to control the bleeding if it recurs.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing inflammatory response, which may be indicative of an infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered to prevent further complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has bleeding at the tracheostomy site, which is likely due to the recent resizing of the tracheostomy tube. The bleeding is concerning as it can lead to blood filling the lungs and potentially endangering the tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is hypotensive. The patient's labs show an elevated WBC count, indicating a possible infection. Other lab results are within normal range. The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission, and he remains comfortable on current ventilator settings. The patient has been started on midazolam, fentanyl, and lorazepam for sedation and pain management. The patient's goals of care include being DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and continuing with ALS treatment. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control should be closely monitored. The patient is at risk for complications such as pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

The tracheostomy tube was downsized to size 7, but the patient continues to have blood secretions without any new active bleeding overnight.

The patient has no known drug allergies and received infusions of midazolam, fentanyl, and lorazepam. Other medications include Rilutek for ALS and Seroquel for anxiety. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate between 81-121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/54 to 157/93 mmHg, respiratory rate at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's height is 67 inches, and fluid balance shows a total input of 1,200 mL and total output of 1,685 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 485 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube with ventilator support in CMV mode.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall individual with a declining hematocrit (Hct) level, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and continues to experience some bleeding around it. The bleeding has eased up but there is concern for infection, as the patient's blood pressure declined to the 70s systolic. The patient was given benzodiazepines and pain medication yesterday morning, but their pressures improved and they are now asymptomatic with good pulses. The patient is being pan-cultured and held sedation, which resulted in blood pressure rising back to baseline. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's blood pressure decline to the 70s systolic suggests possible infection. This is further supported by the decision to pan-culture the patient.
2. Bleeding: The patient is experiencing ongoing bleeding, as indicated by the declining Hct level and oozing around the tracheostomy tube site. This could lead to further blood loss and potential anemia.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on continuous mechanical ventilation with stable settings, indicating chronic respiratory failure. There is also a mention of some leak around the vent site, which may require further attention from respiratory therapy.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, with a total input of 3,310 mL since midnight. However, there is also a significant output of 685 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 2,625 mL. This indicates potential fluid overload and should be closely monitored.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 13.0 K/uL, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly low at 3.3 mEq/L, and magnesium level is within normal range at 1.9 mg/dL."

","The patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing health issues. The chief complaint is bleeding from the tracheostomy tube site. The patient has experienced a decline in blood pressure to the 70s systolic, which was asymptomatic but concerning for infection. The patient has been pan-cultured and is receiving sedation. The bleeding has eased up, but the patient's hematocrit (Hct) is declining overall. The cause of this drop in Hct may be due to dilution from aggressive fluid resuscitation.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received infusions of lansoprazole and midazolam. Other ICU medications include bolus g-tube feedings and rilutek for ALS care. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the bleeding from the tracheostomy tube site.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/60 mmHg to 70/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with a ventilator mode set to CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with settings such as a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP"

","Summary:
The patient in the ICU is experiencing bleeding from the tracheostomy tube site. Their blood pressure has declined to the 70s systolic, but they are asymptomatic with good pulses. Concern for infection led to panculture and the patient's sedation was held, resulting in an increase in blood pressure back to baseline. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is declining, which may be due to dilution from aggressive fluid administration. The patient received a bolus of 500cc for decreased urine output this morning and tube feeds were restarted yesterday. The patient has no known drug allergies. They have been receiving medications such as lansoprazole and midazolam. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted bleeding. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/60 to 70/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 480mL, respiratory rate of 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an RSBI deferred due to ventilator dependency. The patient's ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic examination not assessed, and other assessments similarly noted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of bleeding associated with tracheostomy tube change. The patient's 24-hour events include a bronchoscopy performed due to bleeding at the tracheostomy site, cauterization of the tracheostomy site, and visualization of the airways. The patient also had a urinary tract infection, for which a urine culture was obtained. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells due to complaints of tightness and difficulty taking full breaths, and respiratory therapy with ambu-bag therapy and increased tidal volumes helped improve his condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 95/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 50%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight decrease in blood pressure but remains within acceptable limits. The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, with a total intake of 3,260 mL and total output of 688 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, with a ventilator set at CMV mode, Vt 500 mL, RR 14, PEEP 8 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, and SpO2 98%. The patient's ABG results show a respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.30. The patient's physical examination is mostly deferred due to his inability to move or assess certain parameters. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's assessment includes oliguria/anuria, hypotension, alteration in nutrition, impaired physical mobility, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, and bleeding at the tracheostomy site. The patient's care plan includes ongoing respiratory support, fluid management, glycemic control, line care, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is pending further evaluation. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis due to urinary tract infection or pneumonia, further bleeding at the tracheostomy site, and renal dysfunction."

   BLEEDING AT TRACHEOSTOMY SITE
   Appears to be controlled today without further significant bleeding.
   ENT not opting for further exploration or operation at this point.
   - touch base w ENT re value/lack thereof of CT neck
   - still holding DVT ppx; gets fragmin at rehab facility
   LEFT UPPER LOBE COLLAPSE
   Appears to be resolving by this AM
s chest x-ray. Follow.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Chronic, [**2-5**] ALS. Patient appears to appreciate larger tidal volumes
   than prior, going up on TV for comfort.
   URINARY TRACT INFECTION
   Large blood and bacteria and WBCs seen on UA. Pulled Foley and sending
   new UA and cultures. Use condom cath if possible. Follow up cultures.
   Consider antibiotic regimen for this if UA not clearing p Foley, follow
   speciation and sensitivities. Would like to avoid antibiotics that
   would put Mr [**Known lastname 4118**] at risk for C. diff, if possible, as this would be a
   disastrous outcome for him in terms of health and quality of life.

","The patient's chief complaint is bleeding associated with trach tube change. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy procedure to visualize the airways and cauterize the tracheal site. There was no active bleeding observed during the early morning visit by the ENT specialist. However, there is a question regarding the need for a CT scan of the neck.

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells due to complaints of tightness and difficulty taking full breaths. Respiratory therapy with ambu-bag therapy and increasing tidal volumes helped improve the patient's condition.

The patient has a history of allergies, which was obtained from Hospital 15 medical records. There are no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given on 12/11/2135. The patient is currently on lansoprazole (Prevacid) since 08:00 AM on 12/11/2135. Other medications and medical history changes are also noted.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned conditions. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 72 bpm (71-99 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 95/52 mmHg to 127/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (14-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with ALS who has been admitted to the ICU for persistent bleeding from his tracheostomy site. He underwent cauterization of the tracheostomy site and scope visualization of the airways. The patient was also transfused yesterday morning. He has developed left upper lobe atelectasis on chest X-ray yesterday. His urine culture was obtained at [**2135-12-12**] 01:18 AM. The patient has no known drug allergies. He is currently receiving infusions and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding from the tracheostomy site indicates a potential risk of recurrent bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and Trend Hct (hematocrit) should be done to detect any changes promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has ALS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Being on mechanical ventilation, careful monitoring of respiratory support parameters is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is pending, indicating a possible UTI. Following up on the urine culture results and treating accordingly is important to prevent complications related to UTI.
4. Abdominal distension: The patient has chronic abdominal distension, which may be due to various reasons such as bowel obstruction, ileus, or increased intra-abdominal pressure. Monitoring abdominal sounds and considering"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an advanced ALS patient who is now ventilator dependent.
- The patient experienced bleeding at the tracheostomy site, which appears to be controlled without further significant bleeding.
- The patient had a left upper lobe collapse, which has since resolved.
- The patient is suffering from respiratory failure and is being given larger tidal volumes for comfort.
- The patient has a dirty urinalysis with large blood, bacteria, and WBCs. Foley catheter was removed and new urine analysis and cultures were sent. The use of a condom catheter is being considered.
- The patient also has dilated loops of bowel, most likely due to gas, which the patient frequently experiences problems with. This is worse with tube feed formulation.
- It is planned to transfer the patient to a rehabilitation facility.
- The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition through tube feeds and glycemic control without insulin.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer PPI, and VAP mouth care with HOB elevation.
- The patient's communication is being facilitated through their wife and the use of augmentative and alternative communication methods.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding at tracheostomy site: While the bleeding seems to be controlled for now, there is still a risk of further bleeding or complications related to the tracheostomy site.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on a ventilator indicates ongoing respiratory failure. Adjust"

","The patient is an advanced ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) patient who is now ventilator dependent. The patient experienced bleeding at the tracheostomy site, which appears to be controlled without further significant bleeding. The ENT is not opting for further exploration or operation at this point.

The patient has a history of left upper lobe collapse, which has since resolved. The patient is also dealing with respiratory failure, being on chronic ventilatory support. The patient seems to appreciate larger tidal volumes than before and is going up on TV (tidal volume) for comfort.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) has been identified, with large blood, bacteria, and WBCs seen on urine analysis (UA). The Foley catheter has been pulled, and a new UA and cultures are being sent. If possible, a condom catheter will be used, and follow-up cultures will be done. The physician would like to avoid antibiotics that could put the patient at risk for C. diff, as this would be a disastrous outcome for him in terms of health and quality of life.

The patient also has dilated loops of bowel, most likely due to gas, which the patient often has problems with. Simethicone has been prescribed, and a follow-up exam will be conducted.

The patient's current disposition is transfer to rehab/long-term care facility. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. They have a history of ALS and underwent a tracheostomy, which was recently upsized from a #7 to a #8 due to bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The patient underwent cautery by ENT twice, with no bleeding observed in the last 24 hours. The patient also experienced increased stools with new tube feed.

24-hour events include increased stools with new tube feed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/57 mmHg to 143/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 98%. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there is a slight decrease in hematocrit levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. The patient's glucose levels are also within normal limits. 

Assessment and plan:
The patient has advanced ALS and was admitted with bleeding from the tracheostomy site"
