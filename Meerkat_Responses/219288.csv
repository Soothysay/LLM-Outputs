","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU who has undergone a tracheostomy due to respiratory distress. They experienced complications during sedation with propofol, leading to a change in sedation to versed and fentanyl. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 80% and respiratory rate increased to the 40s, requiring 100% oxygen saturation and normalization of respiratory rate. A bronchoscopy showed a patent airway. Chest X-ray findings are concerning for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and increased fluid in the left lung. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50%, PEEP of 5, PIP of 16, TV of 300, and RR of 20.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.6°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/60 to 80/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increased fluid balance since midnight.

Multiple attempts were made to place an arterial line in the left arm due to concerns about blood pressure cuff-induced coldness. Eventually, a surgery resident successfully placed the line in the left arm. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered, including levofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime.

","The patient is a critically ill, intubated, and mechanically ventilated individual in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing hemodynamic instability, requiring continuous norepinephrine infusion. There is concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on the chest X-ray findings and the need for increased FiO2 and PEEP settings on the ventilator.

The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 80% and respiratory rate increased to the 40s, prompting the use of 100% oxygen saturation. A bronchoscopy was performed, which showed a patent airway.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 94/60 mmHg to 160/89 mmHg. Heart rate has been elevated at 124 bpm. Body temperature is slightly elevated at 39.6°C. There is no information provided regarding the patient's blood glucose level.

The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime within the last 24 hours. Despite this, there is no mention of improvement in the patient's condition.

Multiple attempts were made to place an arterial line in the left arm due to concerns about the blood pressure cuff causing coldness in the arm. Ultimately, the surgery resident placed the line in the left arm.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24,000 K"

   40 yo with metastatic esophageal sq cell carcinoma p/w stridor & fever
   and found to have narrowed vocal cords with narrowed airway to 1-2mm.
   Taken urgently to OR for trach placement with heliox prior.
   Respiratory failure: ? ARDS vs volume overload.  Unsure if it will ever
   be safe to decanulate given stridor and edema.
   -f/u morning ABG for now continue current vent setting, low volume with
   PEEP of 5.  Serial ABGs.
   -Check PF ratio
   -CXR this PM
   -change antibiotics to vancomycin. Cefepime, and clindamycin
   -TEE
   -measure volume status using pulse pressure differential
   -measure svo2 thru A line
   -discuss with thoracics why placed small trach (size 6), can
t  pass
   regular size bronch thru it
   .
   Sepsis/neutropenic fever: will follow MUST criteria. Pt with
   neutropenic fever.  Spiked to 103.
   -follow MAP
   -if get CVL  would only do for 2 days (pending family meeting) will
   check CVP, recheck lHCT and transfuse to > 27 (irradiated), serial
   lactates
   -try to wean levophed then get CTA neck with contrast & abd with
   contrast to look for abscess. Ct chest no contrast.
   -f/u blood cx & urine cx
   -continue filgrastim
   .
   Sinus tachycardia:
   -echo to look for long term damage (cardiomyopathy) secondary to

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old individual with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor and fever. The patient was found to have narrowed vocal cords with a narrowed airway measuring 1-2mm. An urgent tracheostomy was performed in the operating room.

The patient did not tolerate propofol for sedation, so the sedation was changed to versed and fentanyl. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 80%, respiratory rate increased to 40s, and blood pressure dropped. The patient was placed on 100% oxygen saturation, which increased to mid-90s, and the respiratory rate normalized. The patient also required pressors.

An emergent bronchoscopy showed a patent airway. The chest X-ray is concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible fluid accumulation in the left lung. The patient's current ventilator settings include FiO2 of 50%, PEEP of 5, PIP of 16, TV of 300, RR of 20.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including levofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction and now evidence for interval development of pulmonary
   edema (cardiogenic from volume resussitation vs. non-cardiogenic,
   ARDS).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Lung
   protective strategy.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, tumor
   (although no abnormalities identified at surgery).
   SEPSIS -- sepsis physiology, unclear etiology.  Continue early
   goal-directed therapy.  Will need central venous access.
   FLUIDS --  continue resussitation with crystalloid and PRBC, may need
   central line to monitor CVP >12 cmH2O.
   ABD PAIN -- related to G-tube site, ?localized infection vs.
   irritation.  Plan monitor serial exam, consider ABD CT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, although concern for pericardial disease --> would
   check repeat echo to assess LV function, pericardial space.  Also,
   consider cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   FEVER -- concern for new infection in context of neutropenia.
   Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; need to assess upper airway --> CT scan.
   Oncology to F/U, including discussion of direction of future care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer (metastatic) admitted to the ICU with fever and neutropenia. The patient developed stridor and underwent an urgent tracheotomy. He remains mechanically ventilated and experienced oxygen desaturation requiring increased FiO2. A bronchoscopy revealed normal anatomy with an intact trachea. The patient also has diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray, and empiric antimicrobials were expanded. Hypotension developed and required fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. The patient has a central venous line, arterial line, and is receiving multiple medications including sedatives and analgesics.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and upper airway obstruction may lead to respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation to support his breathing.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, neutropenia, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis. Empirical antimicrobial coverage has been initiated while further investigations are ongoing.
3. Upper airway obstruction: The patient's narrowed vocal cords and subsequent stridor indicate a risk of upper airway obstruction. The tracheotomy performed may have helped alleviate this issue.
4. Pulmonary edema: The presence of diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray could indicate pulmonary edema, which can be caused by volume resuscitation or non-cardiogenic causes such as acute"

   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   40 yof esophogeal CA (metastatic) admitted [**2131-3-26**] with fever and
   neutropenia.  Last PM developed stridor--> ENT evaluation observed
   markedly narrowed vocal cords (1-2 mm).  Transferred to MICU and
   eventually underwent urgent tracheotomy.
   Overnight, remains mechanically ventilated.  Experienced oxygen
   desaturation --> required increased FiO2.  Emergent bronchoscopy
   revealed normal anatomy with intact trach.  CXR evolved to diffuse
   infiltrates and empirically expanded antimicrobials.
   Hypotension developed and required fluid and vasopressor (levophed)
   Remains tachycardic.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction and now evidence for interval development of pulmonary
   edema (cardiogenic from volume resussitation vs. non-cardiogenic,
   ARDS).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Lung
   protective strategy.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, tumor
   (although no abnormalities identified at surgery).
   SEPSIS -- sepsis physiology, unclear etiology.  Continue early
   goal-directed therapy.  Will need central venous access.
   FLUIDS --  continue resussitation with crystalloid and PRBC, may need
   central line to monitor CVP >12 cmH2O.
   ABD PAIN -- related to G-tube site, ?localized infection vs.
   irritation.  Plan monitor serial exam, consider ABD CT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, although concern for pericardial disease --> would
   check repeat echo to assess LV function, pericardial space.  Also,
   consider cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   FEVER -- concern for new infection in context of neutropenia.
   Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; need to assess upper airway --> CT scan.
   Oncology to F/U, including discussion of direction of future care.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer. He was admitted with fever and neutropenia and developed stridor, leading to an urgent tracheotomy. The patient remains mechanically ventilated and has experienced oxygen desaturation, requiring increased FiO2. An emergent bronchoscopy revealed normal anatomy with an intact tracheostomy. The patient also developed hypotension and required fluid and vasopressor support. 

The patient has a central line, arterial line, and is receiving multiple antibiotics. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 118 bpm and a temperature of 103.2°F. His respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and he is on mechanical ventilation with a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction and sepsis. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, with urgent tracheostomy performed for upper airway obstruction, and evidence of pulmonary edema. The etiology of the upper airway obstruction is unclear, but possibilities include laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, or tumor. The sepsis physiology is ongoing, and the etiology is unclear.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction and now evidence for interval development of pulmonary
   edema (cardiogenic from volume resussitation vs. non-cardiogenic,
   ARDS).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Lung
   protective strategy.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, tumor
   (although no abnormalities identified at surgery).
   SEPSIS -- sepsis physiology, unclear etiology.  Continue early
   goal-directed therapy.  Will need central venous access.
   FLUIDS --  continue resussitation with crystalloid and PRBC, may need
   central line to monitor CVP >12 cmH2O.
   ABD PAIN -- related to G-tube site, ?localized infection vs.
   irritation.  Plan monitor serial exam, consider ABD CT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, although concern for pericardial disease --> would
   check repeat echo to assess LV function, pericardial space.  Also,
   consider cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   FEVER -- concern for new infection in context of neutropenia.
   Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; need to assess upper airway --> CT scan.
   Oncology to F/U, including discussion of direction of future care.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer (metastatic) admitted with fever and neutropenia. He developed stridor and was evaluated by ENT, who observed markedly narrowed vocal cords. The patient underwent an urgent tracheotomy and remains mechanically ventilated. He experienced oxygen desaturation requiring increased FiO2, and an emergent bronchoscopy revealed normal anatomy with an intact trachea. The patient developed hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. He has diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray and empirically expanded antimicrobials.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.2°F (39.6°C), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 300 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 129 K/uL, creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo with metastatic esophageal sq cell carcinoma p/w stridor & fever
   and found to have narrowed vocal cords with narrowed airway to 1-2mm.
   Taken urgently to OR for trach placement with heliox prior.
   # Sepsis/neutropenic fever:  Patient stable, with CVL and A-Line in
   place.  ANC 235.  Goal MAP is > 65, patient has been at this goal with
   low dose of levophed, unable to completely wean off.  Patient has been
   afebrile for past 24 hours, CVP has been between [**2-1**], with goal > 10.
   Unclear etiology of sepsis, as patient
s CX have shown NGTD.  Patient
   pan CT was unremakable in Abdomen/Pelvis for abcess, but patient with
   calcified CB.  CT neck did show a retropharyngeal developing phlegmon.
   There is concern that this may develop into an abcess as patient
   graulocyte count increases.  Patient will need further monitoring, and
   likely repeat CT neck in a few days.
   -follow MAP, goal > 65; CVP > 10, bolus as needed
   -Wean levophed as tolerated.
   -f/u cultures
   -continue filgrastim
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with trach in place, has maintained
   good oxygen saturation.  Likely not ARDS.  ENT reevaluated airway and
   given lack of mobility of vocal cords, likely an infilration of cancer
   and thus would not benefit from steroids.  Patient will also need an
   enlarged trach at some point.  For now, given high PO2, can decrease
   FiO2 to 0.3, and treat patient
s Pneumonia with Vanc/Clinda/Cefepime.
   Patient has been overbreathing the ventilator.
   - Continue Antibiotics
   - Decrease FiO2 to 0.3
   - Will ultimately transition to pressure support as patient has
   respiratory drive
   # Anemia:  HCT stable.   Patient has was given 2u PRBCs and responded
   appropriately.
   - Monitor
   Metastatic esophageal cancer.
   - Goal of care at this time is aggressive care of above.
   Left flank/low back pain likely due to mets: continue lidocaine,
   methadone, tylenol

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who presented with stridor and fever. The patient was found to have narrowed vocal cords with a narrowed airway measuring 1-2 mm. An urgent tracheostomy placement was performed in the operating room, and the patient was placed on heliox prior to the procedure.

The patient's 24-hour events include a change in antibiotics to clindamycin, vancomycin, and cefepime, as well as the placement of a central line with low CVPs. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and responded appropriately. An echocardiogram was normal, and blood cultures are pending. The patient has been unable to wean off of levofloxacin. The lactate level is 0.8, and mixed venous O2 saturation is 81%. A family meeting was held, and it was decided to pursue aggressive measures for now, but open to discussion if things go awry. Checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was also noted.

","The patient is a 40-year-old with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor and fever. They underwent urgent tracheostomy placement due to narrowed vocal cords with an airway of only 1-2 mm. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation with a low volume strategy and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Their FiO2 is set at 40%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 108/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient is tachycardic but has a normal heart rhythm.

The patient's blood cultures are pending, and they have been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including clindamycin, vancomycin, and cefepime. They also have an indwelling central venous line, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter in place.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL, slightly elevated lactate level of 0.8 mmol/L, and low platelet count of 129 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor, fever, and narrowed vocal cords with an airway of 1-2mm. He was taken urgently to the operating room for tracheostomy placement. In the ICU, he is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has sepsis/neutropenic fever and anemia. The patient's condition is stable, but there are concerns about the development of a phlegmon and potential abscess in the neck. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, central venous pressure (CVP) above 10, and wean off levophed as tolerated. Antibiotics have been changed, and FiO2 has been decreased to 0.3. The patient's HCT is stable, and he has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) appropriately. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/neutropenic fever: The patient has been stable with CVL and A-line in place, ANC 235, goal MAP is > 65, and patient has been at this goal with low-dose levophed. He is unable to completely wean off. There is uncertainty about the etiology of sepsis, as patient CXR have shown NGTD. The patient's pan CT was unremarkable in the abdomen/pelvis for abs"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo with metastatic esophageal sq cell carcinoma p/w stridor & fever
   and found to have narrowed vocal cords with narrowed airway to 1-2mm.
   Taken urgently to OR for trach placement with heliox prior.
   Respiratory failure: ? ARDS vs volume overload.  Unsure if it will ever
   be safe to decanulate given stridor and edema.
   -f/u morning ABG for now continue current vent setting, low volume with
   PEEP of 5.  Serial ABGs.
   -Check PF ratio
   -CXR this PM
   -change antibiotics to vancomycin. Cefepime, and clindamycin
   -TEE
   -measure volume status using pulse pressure differential
   -measure svo2 thru A line
   -discuss with thoracics why placed small trach (size 6), can
t  pass
   regular size bronch thru it
   .
   Sepsis/neutropenic fever: will follow MUST criteria. Pt with
   neutropenic fever.  Spiked to 103.
   -follow MAP
   -if get CVL  would only do for 2 days (pending family meeting) will
   check CVP, recheck lHCT and transfuse to > 27 (irradiated), serial
   lactates
   -try to wean levophed then get CTA neck with contrast & abd with
   contrast to look for abscess. Ct chest no contrast.
   -f/u blood cx & urine cx
   -continue filgrastim
   .
   Sinus tachycardia:
   -echo to look for long term damage (cardiomyopathy) secondary to
   tachycardia
   .
   Metastatic esophageal cancer. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4113**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2269**] very committed to pt care
   and excellent advocate is GI MD.
   -goals of care meeting today.  Discuss if should do CVL.  Also discuss
   if ever will be safe  to decanulate
   -continue filgrastim
   -return with interpreter
   .
   h/o hypercalemia: IVF improved.
   -will follow
   .
   Left flank/low back pain likely due to mets: continue lidocaine,
   methadone, tylenol

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor and fever. The patient had narrowed vocal cords and a narrowed airway measuring 1-2 mm, leading to urgent tracheostomy placement in the operating room. The patient is currently in the ICU.

The patient's 24-hour events include changes in antibiotics to clindamycin, vancomycin, and cefepime; placement of a central line with low CVPs; transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells; an echocardiogram showing normal results; blood cultures pending; inability to wean off levofloxacin; lactate level at 0.8; mixed venous O2 saturation at 81%; a family meeting held discussing aggressive measures but open to discussion if things go wrong; checking [Last Name (un) 402] stim; determination of radiation field likely to be upper throat and head; and thoracics planned to upsize trach on Friday.

The patient has allergies to Roxicet (Oral) (Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen) and nausea/vomiting. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on [2131-3-28].

The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), and norepinephrine. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction and now evidence for interval development of pulmonary
   edema (cardiogenic from volume resussitation vs. non-cardiogenic,
   ARDS).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Lung
   protective strategy.  Adjust FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90% or pO2> 60
   mmHg.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, tumor
   (although no abnormalities identified at surgery).
   SEPSIS -- sepsis physiology, unclear etiology.  Concerns include lung
   or new abscess (near trachea).  Continue early goal-directed therapy.
   Central venous access established.  Aim CVP >10
   FLUIDS --  continue resussitation with crystalloid and PRBC, may need
   central line to monitor CVP >10 cmH2O.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, although concern for pericardial disease --> would
   check repeat echo to assess LV function, pericardial space.  Also,
   consider cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; Oncology to F/U, including discussion of
   direction of future care.  Family meeting today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction and pulmonary edema. This requires continued mechanical ventilation and monitoring of ABG (arterial blood gas) to maintain oxygenation.

2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, although the exact etiology is unclear. It is important to continue early goal-directed therapy and monitor for signs of infection.

3. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored due to fluid resuscitation. The target CVP (central venous pressure) should be maintained above 10 cmH2O.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL. Plan to transfuse red blood cells to maintain a hemoglobin level above 27.

5. Neutropenia: The patient has neutropenia with a WBC count of 2.2 K/uL. Empirical antimicrobial coverage should be provided while the patient is febrile.

6. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which may be multifactorial. Further evaluation should include assessing for pericardial disease and cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.

7. Esophageal cancer: The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction and now evidence for interval development of pulmonary
   edema (cardiogenic from volume resussitation vs. non-cardiogenic,
   ARDS).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Lung
   protective strategy.  Adjust FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90% or pO2> 60
   mmHg.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, tumor
   (although no abnormalities identified at surgery).
   SEPSIS -- sepsis physiology, unclear etiology.  Concerns include lung
   or new abscess (near trachea).  Continue early goal-directed therapy.
   Central venous access established.  Aim CVP >10
   FLUIDS --  continue resussitation with crystalloid and PRBC, may need
   central line to monitor CVP >10 cmH2O.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, although concern for pericardial disease --> would
   check repeat echo to assess LV function, pericardial space.  Also,
   consider cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; need to assess upper airway --> CT scan.
   Oncology to F/U, including discussion of direction of future care.
   Family meeting today.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, sepsis, upper airway obstruction, and other potential medical complications. Based on the provided information, here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction and pulmonary edema. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor arterial blood gas (ABG) levels.

2. Upper Airway Obstruction: The cause of the upper airway obstruction is unclear, but it may be due to laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, or tumor. Urgent tracheostomy has been performed to address this issue.

3. Sepsis: The patient is also suffering from sepsis, with unclear etiology. Possible causes include lung infection or a new abscess near the trachea. Early goal-directed therapy is being continued, including central venous access and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP).

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored and managed. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and packed red blood cells (PRBC) is ongoing, and central line placement is being considered to monitor CVP levels.

5. Abdominal Pain: The patient has tender G-tube site pain, which has improved. Serial examination will be conducted, and an abdominal CT scan may be considered.

6. Tachycardia: The"

   and found to have narrowed vocal cords with narrowed airway to 1-2mm.
   Taken urgently to OR for trach placement with heliox prior.
   # Sepsis/neutropenic fever:  Patient stable, with CVL and A-Line in
   place.  ANC 235.  Goal MAP is > 65, patient has been at this goal with
   low dose of levophed, unable to completely wean off.  Patient has been
   afebrile for past 24 hours, CVP has been between [**2-1**], with goal > 10.
   Unclear etiology of sepsis, as patient
s CX have shown NGTD.  Patient
   pan CT was unremakable in Abdomen/Pelvis for abcess, but patient with
   calcified CB.  CT neck did show a retropharyngeal developing phlegmon.
   There is concern that this may develop into an abcess as patient
   graulocyte count increases.  Patient will need further monitoring, and
   likely repeat CT neck in a few days.
   -follow MAP, goal > 65; CVP > 10, bolus as needed
   -Wean levophed as tolerated.
   -f/u cultures
   -continue filgrastim
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with trach in place, has maintained
   good oxygen saturation.  Likely not ARDS.  ENT reevaluated airway and
   given lack of mobility of vocal cords, likely an infilration of cancer
   and thus would not benefit from steroids.  Patient will also need an
   enlarged trach at some point.  For now, given high PO2, can decrease
   FiO2 to 0.3, and treat patient
s Pneumonia with Vanc/Clinda/Cefepime.
   Patient has been overbreathing the ventilator.
   - Continue Antibiotics
   - Decrease FiO2 to 0.3
   - Will ultimately transition to pressure support as patient has
   respiratory drive
   # Anemia:  HCT stable.   Patient has was given 2u PRBCs and responded
   appropriately.
   - Monitor
   Metastatic esophageal cancer.
   - Goal of care at this time is aggressive care of above.
   Left flank/low back pain likely due to mets: continue lidocaine,

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old individual with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor and fever. They have a narrowed airway due to narrowed vocal cords and required an urgent tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for sepsis/neutropenic fever, respiratory failure, and anemia. They have a history of metastatic esophageal cancer and are receiving aggressive care. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a MAP goal of >65 and CVP between 2-10. They are on multiple medications including antibiotics, filgrastim, and pain management. The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, liver function tests, and electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/neutropenic fever: The patient is at risk for further episodes of sepsis due to their low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and the presence of a developing phlegmon in the neck region. Close monitoring and repeat imaging may be necessary to identify any abscess formation.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a narrowed airway due to narrowed vocal cords, which could lead to ongoing respiratory distress. Tracheostomy placement has been done, but the patient may require an enlarged tracheostomy in the future. Overbreathing of the ventilator should be closely monitored.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo with metastatic esophageal sq cell carcinoma p/w stridor & fever
   and found to have narrowed vocal cords with narrowed airway to 1-2mm.
   Taken urgently to OR for trach placement with heliox prior.
   # Sepsis/neutropenic fever:  Patient stable, with CVL and A-Line in
   place.  ANC 235.  Goal MAP is > 65, patient has been at this goal with
   low dose of levophed, unable to completely wean off.  Patient has been
   afebrile for past 24 hours, CVP has been between [**2-1**], with goal > 10.
   Unclear etiology of sepsis, as patient
s CX have shown NGTD.  Patient
   pan CT was unremakable in Abdomen/Pelvis for abcess, but patient with
   calcified CB.  CT neck did show a retropharyngeal developing phlegmon.
   There is concern that this may develop into an abcess as patient
   graulocyte count increases.  Patient will need further monitoring, and
   likely repeat CT neck in a few days.  On [**3-30**] pt no longer neutropenic
   with ANC up to 660 and WBC increased to 1.4.
   -follow MAP, goal > 65; CVP > 10, bolus as needed.  Pt already received
   one bolus this AM.
   -f/u cultures
   -d/c filgrastim given
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with trach in place, has maintained
   good oxygen saturation.  Likely not ARDS.  ENT reevaluated airway and
   given lack of mobility of vocal cords, likely an infilration of cancer
   and thus would not benefit from steroids.  Patient will also need an
   enlarged trach at some point.  For now, given high PO2, can decrease
   FiO2 to 0.3, and treat patient
s Pneumonia with Vanc/Clinda/Cefepime.
   Patient has been overbreathing the ventilator.  Did not tolerate PS on
   [**3-29**] as pt became tachypnic immediately
   - Continue Antibiotics vanc/cefepime/clindamycin
   - Continue fi02 at 30%, will ultimately transition to pressure support
   as patient has respiratory drive.  Trial of PS this afternoon.
   -Ultimate goal is trach collar
   # Anemia:  HCT stable.   Patient has was given 2u PRBCs on [**3-29**] and
   responded appropriately.
   - Monitor HCT trend today was 30.3 -> 25.5.  Will check pm HCT.
   Metastatic esophageal cancer.
   - Goal of care at this time is aggressive care of above.
   Left flank/low back pain likely due to mets: continue lidocaine,
   methadone, tylenol

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor and fever. They have a narrowed airway, requiring urgent tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to cancer infiltration of the vocal cords. They also have sepsis/neutropenic fever, likely secondary to a developing phlegmon in the neck region, and pneumonia being treated with appropriate antibiotics. The patient's anemia is stable, and they received 2 units of packed red blood cells on [3-29] with an appropriate response. They have metastatic esophageal cancer and are on aggressive care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's narrowed airway and tracheostomy, there is a risk of ongoing respiratory distress or obstruction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever suggests an underlying infection, which can progress to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia needs to be closely monitored and treated appropriately to prevent worsening of symptoms.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged immobilization, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to their critical condition and prolonged ICU stay.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The use of mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction and now evidence for interval development of pulmonary
   edema (cardiogenic from volume resussitation vs. non-cardiogenic,
   ARDS).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, FiO2 to maintain SaO2
   >90% or pO2> 60 mmHg.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, tumor
   (although no abnormalities identified at surgery).
   SEPSIS -- sepsis physiology, unclear etiology.  Concerns include lung
   or new abscess (near trachea).  Continue early goal-directed therapy.
   Central venous access established.  Aim CVP >10
   FLUIDS --  continue resussitation with crystalloid and PRBC, may need
   central line to monitor CVP >10 cmH2O.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; Oncology to F/U, including discussion of
   direction of future care.  Family meeting today.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and remains intubated, mechanically ventilated. The patient appears much improved today, more comfortable. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including upper airway obstruction and pulmonary edema. The cause of the upper airway obstruction is unclear, but concerns include laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, or tumor. Sepsis is also present, with unclear etiology, and concerns include lung infection or a new abscess near the trachea. The patient's tachycardia is multifactorial and may be due to fever, pain, anxiety, sepsis, or cardiomyopathy. Neutropenia is present, and the patient is receiving empirical antimicrobial coverage. Anemia is noted, and the plan is to transfuse to a hematocrit level of >27 using irradiated PRBC. The patient's esophageal cancer has metastasized, and a family meeting will be held today to discuss the direction of future care."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, sepsis, and upper airway obstruction. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's condition appears to have improved today, as they seem more comfortable and able to communicate through writing with the help of an interpreter. The patient's medical history, allergies, and previous medications are noted. The patient has a history of esophageal cancer with metastasis and requires ongoing oncology follow-up.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including upper airway obstruction and potential pulmonary edema. They require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygen saturation above 90% or partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) above 60 mmHg. There is a plan to work towards weaning and tracheostomy collar removal.

2. Upper Airway Obstruction: The cause of the upper airway obstruction is unclear, but possible etiologies include laryngospasm, edema secondary to acid reflux, localized abscess, or tumor. A CT scan suggests the presence of an abscess or tumor. The patient will maintain a tracheostomy.

3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis physiology, but the exact cause is unknown. Concerns include lung or near-tracheal abscess. Early goal-directed therapy will be continued, including central venous access to maintain central venous pressure (C"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo with metastatic esophageal sq cell carcinoma p/w stridor & fever
   and found to have narrowed vocal cords with narrowed airway to 1-2mm.
   Taken urgently to OR for trach placement with heliox prior.
   # Sepsis/neutropenic fever:  Patient stable, with CVL and A-Line in
   place.  MAP have been > 60s.  CVP often 7 requiring bolus but pt
   putting out a lot of urine.  Pt
s home BP is 80s-90s systolic so likely
   we are volume repleting her when she does not need it given how much
   urine she is putting out..  Unclear etiology of sepsis, as patient
s CX
   have shown NGTD.  Patient
s pan CT was unremakable in Abdomen/Pelvis
   for abcess, but patient with calcified CB.  CT neck did show a
   retropharyngeal developing phlegmon.  There is concern that this may
   develop into an abcess as patient
s graulocyte count increases.
   Patient will need further monitoring, and likely repeat CT neck in a
   few days.  On [**3-30**] pt no longer neutropenic with ANC up to 660 and WBC
   increased to 1.4.  On [**3-31**] ANC 1800.
   -new map goal > 55 (likely CVP goal 7) give volume based on new MAP
   goal and sx)
   -f/u cultures
   -d/c filgrastim
   -continue vanco & cefepime.  Clindamycin course completed today.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with trach in place, has maintained
   good oxygen saturation.  Likely not ARDS.  ENT reevaluated airway and
   given lack of mobility of vocal cords, likely an infilration of cancer
   and thus would not benefit from steroids.  Patient will also need an
   enlarged trach at some point.  For now, given high PO2, can decrease
   FiO2 to 0.3, and treat patient
s Pneumonia with Vanc/Cefepime (got last
   dose of clinda today).   Did not tolerate PS on [**3-29**] or [**3-30**].
   - Continue Antibiotics vanc/cefepime (clindamycin done)
   - Continue fi02 at 30%, will ultimately transition to pressure support
   as patient has respiratory drive.
   -Trial of just trach collar today
   .
   # Anemia:  HCT stable.   Patient has was given 2u PRBCs on [**3-29**] and
   responded appropriately.
   - transfuse if < 25
   Metastatic esophageal cancer.
   -          Goal of care at this time is aggressive care of above but no
   more chemo
   -          Monitor pt for signs of depression
   Left flank/low back pain likely due to mets: continue lidocaine,
   methadone, tylenol
   Electrolytes: repleted mg, k, and phos

","The patient is a 40-year-old with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who presented with stridor and fever. They were found to have narrowed vocal cords with a narrowed airway measuring 1-2 mm. An urgent tracheostomy was performed. The patient has been in the ICU since then.

24-hour events include poor response to pressure support, an increase in hematocrit from 25 to 28.2, pH 1.4 (repeated), MAP in the 60s, initiation of tube feeds, weaning of sedation, and consideration for hospice care.

Allergies include Roxicet (oral), which is oxycodone HCl/acetaminophen, and nausea/vomiting.

Infusions include lansoprazole (Prevacid), fentanyl, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned below. Flow sheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be alert, awake, and interactive. There is tachycardia, normal S1/S2 without murmurs or gallops, and tracheostomy site healing well. Mild tenderness is noted over the left lower rib anteriorly. Extremities show no edema, and deep pulse"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo with metastatic esophageal sq cell carcinoma p/w stridor & fever
   and found to have narrowed vocal cords with narrowed airway to 1-2mm.
   Taken urgently to OR for trach placement with heliox prior.
   # Sepsis/neutropenic fever:  Patient stable, with CVL and A-Line in
   place.  ANC 235.  Goal MAP is > 65, patient has been at this goal with
   low dose of levophed, unable to completely wean off.  Patient has been
   afebrile for past 24 hours, CVP has been between [**2-1**], with goal > 10.
   Unclear etiology of sepsis, as patient
s CX have shown NGTD.  Patient
   pan CT was unremakable in Abdomen/Pelvis for abcess, but patient with
   calcified CB.  CT neck did show a retropharyngeal developing phlegmon.
   There is concern that this may develop into an abcess as patient
   graulocyte count increases.  Patient will need further monitoring, and
   likely repeat CT neck in a few days.  On [**3-30**] pt no longer neutropenic
   with ANC up to 660 and WBC increased to 1.4.
   -follow MAP, goal > 65; CVP > 10, bolus as needed.  Pt already received
   one bolus this AM.
   -f/u cultures
   -d/c filgrastim given
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with trach in place, has maintained
   good oxygen saturation.  Likely not ARDS.  ENT reevaluated airway and
   given lack of mobility of vocal cords, likely an infilration of cancer
   and thus would not benefit from steroids.  Patient will also need an
   enlarged trach at some point.  For now, given high PO2, can decrease
   FiO2 to 0.3, and treat patient
s Pneumonia with Vanc/Clinda/Cefepime.
   Patient has been overbreathing the ventilator.  Did not tolerate PS on
   [**3-29**] as pt became tachypnic immediately
   - Continue Antibiotics vanc/cefepime/clindamycin
   - Continue fi02 at 30%, will ultimately transition to pressure support
   as patient has respiratory drive.  Trial of PS this afternoon.
   -Ultimate goal is trach collar
   # Anemia:  HCT stable.   Patient has was given 2u PRBCs on [**3-29**] and
   responded appropriately.
   - Monitor HCT trend today was 30.3 -> 25.5.  Will check pm HCT.
   Metastatic esophageal cancer.
   - Goal of care at this time is aggressive care of above.
   Left flank/low back pain likely due to mets: continue lidocaine,
   methadone, tylenol

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old individual with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor and fever. They have a narrowed airway measuring 1-2mm and have undergone an urgent tracheostomy. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of poor pressure support, fluctuating hemoglobin levels, and low blood pressure. They have received various treatments including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and respiratory support. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 93/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and neutrophil percentage, indicating possible infection. The assessment and plan highlight the patient's ongoing sepsis, respiratory failure, anemia, and metastatic esophageal cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's narrowed airway and compromised respiratory function pose a significant risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and appropriate respiratory support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and neutrophil percentage suggest an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, regular assessment of laboratory parameters, and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial to manage sepsis effectively.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have"

   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction.  Pulmonary edema component resolved.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation, FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90% or pO2> 60 mmHg.
   Hope to work towards weaning and trach collar.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor (although no abnormalities
   identified at surgery).  CT suggests abscess or tumor.  Plan to
   maintain trach.
   HYPOTENSION
 resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Goal for MAP >55 mmHg
   (relatively low at  baseline, and currently awake, intteractive
   appropriate, good urine output).
   SEPSIS
 resolved.  Concerns include lung or new abscess (near
   trachea).  Monitor vs.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Now urine output similar to total input.  Would
   reduce iv fluids to maintenance.  Iv fluid bolus for hypotension.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT if progresses.
   CHEST WALL PAIN
 bone pain, focal, point, reproducible with
   palpation.  Suspect MS.  Monitor.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   Neurtropenia resolved now 2 days.  d/c precautions.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; no further plans for treatment per
   Oncology.

The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. They have been mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and remain sedated. The patient is interactive and communicative through an interpreter. They experience mild left chest wall discomfort/pain, which is reproduced with palpation. The patient has a history of esophageal cancer with metastasis and chronic lung conditions.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction.  Pulmonary edema component resolved.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation, FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90% or pO2> 60 mmHg.
   Hope to work towards weaning and trach collar.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor (although no abnormalities
   identified at surgery).  CT suggests abscess or tumor.  Plan to
   maintain trach.
   HYPOTENSION
 resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Goal for MAP >55 mmHg
   (relatively low at  baseline, and currently awake, intteractive
   appropriate, good urine output).
   SEPSIS
 resolved.  Concerns include lung or new abscess (near
   trachea).  Monitor vs.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Now urine output similar to total input.  Would
   reduce iv fluids to maintenance.  Iv fluid bolus for hypotension.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT if progresses.
   CHEST WALL PAIN
 bone pain, focal, point, reproducible with
   palpation.  Suspect MS.  Monitor.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   Neurtropenia resolved now 2 days.  d/c precautions.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; no further plans for treatment per
   Oncology.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure with an unclear etiology for upper airway obstruction. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. There are concerns about a possible lung abscess or tumor, as suggested by a CT scan.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, likely due to sepsis, and the goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg. The patient's sepsis has also resolved, and there are concerns about new lung or tracheal abscesses. Fluid levels have been repleted, and the patient's urine output is similar to their total input.

The patient has tender and improved G-tube site pain, with plans to monitor serial exams and consider an abdominal CT if necessary. There is also bone pain that is focal, point-like, and reproducible with palpation, suspecting multiple sclerosis (MS). The patient's tachycardia is multifactorial, including fever, pain, anxiety, sepsis, and possible cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.

The patient had neutropenia, which has resolved now for two days, and precautions have been discontinued. The patient's fever has improved, and empirical antimicrobials have been administered. Anemia plans include transfusing to a hemoglobin level of at least 27, using irradiated packed red blood cells (PRBC"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction.  Pulmonary edema component resolved.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation, FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90% or pO2> 60 mmHg.
   Hope to work towards weaning and trach collar.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor (although no abnormalities
   identified at surgery).  CT suggests abscess or tumor.  Plan to
   maintain trach.
   SEPSIS -- sepsis physiology, unclear etiology.  Concerns include lung
   or new abscess (near trachea).  Continue early goal-directed therapy.
   Central venous access established.  Aim CVP >10
   FLUIDS --  continue resussitation with crystalloid and PRBC, may need
   central line to monitor CVP >10 cmH2O.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT if progresses.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   Neurtropenia resolved now 2 days.  d/c precautions.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; Oncology to F/U, including discussion of
   direction of future care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old individual with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor and fever. They were found to have narrowed vocal cords and a narrowed airway measuring 1-2 mm. The patient underwent an urgent tracheostomy procedure with heliox prior to intubation. Currently, the patient is stable on a tracheostomy mask with good oxygen saturation on 40% FiO2. The patient requires an enlarged tracheostomy in approximately two weeks due to tumor infiltration of the vocal cords.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Neutropenic Fever: The patient had an episode of sepsis/neutropenic fever, which has resolved. It is likely of pulmonary origin, and there is no progression in the disease on the chest X-ray. The patient should continue with vancomycin and cefepime for the full 10-day course.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently stable on a tracheostomy mask with good oxygen saturation on 40% FiO2. However, the patient will need an enlarged tracheostomy at some point, likely two weeks out. There should be an attempt to decrease FiO2 as tolerated, and a PT consult is recommended.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable, and they received 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**3-29**] and responded appropriately. If"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo with metastatic esophageal sq cell carcinoma p/w stridor & fever
   and found to have narrowed vocal cords with narrowed airway to 1-2mm.
   Taken urgently to OR for trach placement with heliox prior.
   # Sepsis/neutropenic fever:  Patient stable, with CVL and A-Line in
   place.  MAP have been > 60s.  CVP often 7 requiring bolus but pt
   putting out a lot of urine.  Pt
s home BP is 80s-90s systolic so likely
   we are volume repleting her when she does not need it given how much
   urine she is putting out..  Unclear etiology of sepsis, as patient
s CX
   have shown NGTD.  Patient
s pan CT was unremakable in Abdomen/Pelvis
   for abcess, but patient with calcified CB.  CT neck did show a
   retropharyngeal developing phlegmon.  There is concern that this may
   develop into an abcess as patient
s graulocyte count increases.
   Patient will need further monitoring, and likely repeat CT neck in a
   few days.  On [**3-30**] pt no longer neutropenic with ANC up to 660 and WBC
   increased to 1.4.  On [**3-31**] ANC 1800.
   -new map goal > 55 (likely CVP goal 7) give volume based on new MAP
   goal and sx)
   -f/u cultures
   -d/c filgrastim
   -continue vanco & cefepime.  Clindamycin course completed today.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with trach in place, has maintained
   good oxygen saturation.  Likely not ARDS.  ENT reevaluated airway and
   given lack of mobility of vocal cords, likely an infilration of cancer
   and thus would not benefit from steroids.  Patient will also need an
   enlarged trach at some point.  For now, given high PO2, can decrease
   FiO2 to 0.3, and treat patient
s Pneumonia with Vanc/Cefepime (got last
   dose of clinda today).   Did not tolerate PS on [**3-29**] or [**3-30**].
   - Continue Antibiotics vanc/cefepime (clindamycin done)
   - Continue fi02 at 30%, will ultimately transition to pressure support
   as patient has respiratory drive.
   -Trial of just trach collar today
   .
   # Anemia:  HCT stable.   Patient has was given 2u PRBCs on [**3-29**] and
   responded appropriately.
   - transfuse if < 25
   Metastatic esophageal cancer.
   -          Goal of care at this time is aggressive care of above but no
   more chemo
   -          Monitor pt for signs of depression
   Left flank/low back pain likely due to mets: continue lidocaine,
   methadone, tylenol

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old individual with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presenting with stridor and fever. The patient was found to have narrowed vocal cords with a narrowed airway measuring 1-2mm. An urgent tracheostomy placement was performed, along with the administration of heliox prior to the procedure.

The patient's 24-hour events include being weaned to a tracheostomy collar, discontinuing filgrastim as the patient is no longer neutropenic, and stable blood pressures without the need for boluses. The patient's allergies are noted as roxicet (oral), and they have a history of nausea/vomiting.

Regarding medications, the last doses of antibiotics were given on 03/31/2131 at 08:15 AM (Clindamycin) and 07:30 PM (Vancomycin). Cefepime was started on 04/01/2131 at 12:01 AM. The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications and other medications as well.

In terms of vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring, the patient's temperature is within normal range, with a maximum temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F) and a current temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F). The patient's heart rate ranges between 89-106 beats per minute, with a blood pressure reading of 98/60 mmH"

   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction.  Pulmonary edema component resolved.  Excllent progress to
   trach collar.  FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90%.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor (although no abnormalities
   identified at surgery).  CT suggests abscess or tumor.  Plan to
   maintain trach.
   HYPOTENSION
 resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Goal for MAP >55 mmHg
   (relatively low at  baseline, and currently awake, intteractive
   appropriate, good urine output).
   SEPSIS
 resolved.  Concerns include lung or new abscess (near
   trachea).  Monitor VS.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Now urine output similar to total input.  Would
   reduce iv fluids to maintenance.  Iv fluid bolus for hypotension.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT if progresses.
   CHEST WALL PAIN
 bone pain, focal, point, reproducible with
   palpation.  Suspect Musculo-Skeletal.  Monitor.  Review
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   Neurtropenia resolved now 2 days.  d/c precautions.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; no further plans for treatment per
   Oncology.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction. The cause of the obstruction is unclear, but it could be related to laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor. The patient also has sepsis, which has resolved, and hypotension that has improved. Fluids have been adjusted to maintain urine output. There is a possibility of a new abscess near the trachea. The patient's chest pain is suspected to be musculoskeletal. Neutropenia has resolved, and the patient's fever has improved with empirical antimicrobials. Anemia is present, and the plan is to transfuse to a hemoglobin level of 27. The patient has a history of esophageal cancer with metastasis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening upper airway obstruction.
2. Development of pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
3. Sepsis secondary to a new infection or progression of the existing infection.
4. Hypotension leading to shock.
5. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia or transfusion-related events.
6. Further deterioration of renal function.
7. Malnutrition due to inadequate nutritional support.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), s/p Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction.  Pulmonary edema component resolved.  Excellent progress
   to trach collar.  FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90%.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor (although no abnormalities
   identified at surgery).  CT suggests abscess or tumor.  Plan to
   maintain trach.  Will need re-imaging.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   HYPOTENSION
 resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Goal for MAP >55 mmHg
   (relatively low at  baseline, and currently awake, intteractive
   appropriate, good urine output).
   SEPSIS
 resolved.  Concerns include lung or new abscess (near
   trachea).  Monitor VS.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Now urine output similar to total input.  Would
   reduce iv fluids to maintenance.  Iv fluid bolus for hypotension.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT if progresses.
   CHEST WALL PAIN
 bone pain, focal, point, reproducible with
   palpation.  Suspect Musculo-Skeletal.  Monitor.  Review
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   Neurtropenia resolved now 2 days.  d/c precautions.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy
   ESOPHOGEAL CA -- metastatic; no further plans for treatment per
   Oncology.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction. They have a history of sepsis, which has been resolved. The patient also has sinus tachycardia, hypotension (resolved), anemia, and neutropenia. Other conditions include chest wall pain, abdominal pain, and esophageal cancer with metastasis. The patient is currently receiving ICU care and is on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the respiratory failure and upper airway obstruction, the patient is at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and atelectasis.
2. Infection: Although the sepsis has been resolved, there is still a concern for new infections due to the presence of an indwelling tracheostomy and potential lung abscess.
3. Cardiac Complications: Sinus tachycardia may lead to arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and use of anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The abdominal pain and tender G-tube site may indicate potential gastrointestinal issues, including infections or bowel ischemia.
6. Metastatic Spread: The presence of metastatic esophageal cancer increases the risk of further spread to other organs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction. The cause of the obstruction is unclear, with possible etiologies including laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor. The patient has also experienced sepsis, tachycardia, hypotension, and anemia. They have a history of esophageal cancer with metastasis and chronic lung density in the left lower lobe, which could be due to scarring or residual malignancy. The patient's condition has improved, but they require continued monitoring and treatment in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to the upper airway obstruction. If this obstruction persists or worsens, it could lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening hypoxia.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is still concern for new lung or abscess-related infections. Monitoring vital signs and maintaining appropriate antimicrobial coverage will be important to prevent recurrent sepsis.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia may persist due to factors such as fever, pain, anxiety, or cardiomyopathy resulting from chronic tachycardia. Close monitoring of heart rate and evaluation for arrhythmias are necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but careful monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining adequate intr"

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who presented with stridor and fever. She was found to have narrowed vocal cords with a narrowed airway measuring 1-2 mm. She underwent an urgent tracheostomy placement with heliox prior to intubation in the operating room. The patient's initial presentation of sepsis/neutropenic fever has resolved, likely due to a pulmonary source. Her chest X-ray shows no progression in disease.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
- Heart rate: 125 bpm (with a normal range of 105-129 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 93/61 mmHg (with a normal range of 83/54-111/66 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 33 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 19-33 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on tracheostomy mask

The patient's physical examination revealed tachycardia, no murmurs or gallops, normal S1/S2 heart sounds, clear to auscultation anteriorly with mild Hospital1-bilateral crackles. Her abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No extremity changes were noted.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored as she is dependent on the tracheostomy mask for ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if there is obstruction or infection.
2. Anemia: The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on [**3-29**] and responded appropriately. Her hematocrit (HCT) has been stable since then. Continuous monitoring of her blood counts and symptoms of anemia is necessary.
3. Metastatic esophageal cancer: The patient's underlying cancer may progress and cause further complications such as obstruction, bleeding, or pain.
4. Depression: Given the patient's condition and prognosis, monitoring for signs of depression is important. Psychological support should be considered.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), s/p Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction.  Pulmonary edema component resolved.  Excellent progress
   to trach collar.  FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90%.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor (although no abnormalities
   identified at surgery).  CT suggests abscess or tumor.  Plan to
   maintain trach.  Will need re-imaging.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   HYPOTENSION
 resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Goal for MAP >55 mmHg
   (relatively low at  baseline, and currently awake, intteractive
   appropriate, good urine output).
   SEPSIS
 resolved.  Concerns include lung or new abscess (near
   trachea).  Monitor VS.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Now urine output similar to total input.  Would
   reduce iv fluids to maintenance.  Iv fluid bolus for hypotension.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT if progresses.
   CHEST WALL PAIN
 bone pain, focal, point, reproducible with
   palpation.  Suspect Musculo-Skeletal.  Monitor.  Review
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   Neurtropenia resolved now 2 days.  d/c precautions.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with an upper airway obstruction, for which they have been placed on a tracheostomy (trach) collar. The obstruction could be due to laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor, as suggested by a CT scan. The patient also experienced mild relative hypotension during sleep, which resolved. They were diagnosed with sepsis, but it has since resolved. The patient's tachycardia, hypotension, and fever have also improved. They have neutropenia, anemia, and a history of respiratory failure. The patient's lungs show chronic changes with possible scarring or residual malignancy. They are currently receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN and have multiple IV lines in place for medication administration. The patient's code status is full code, and they are planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's existing respiratory failure could worsen if the tracheostomy becomes obstructed or if there is a recurrence of the underlying cause.
2. Infection: The patient has had episodes of fever and sepsis in the past, indicating a risk of infection. This could be due to their compromised immune system or prolonged ICU stay.
3. Bleeding: The patient has anemia and is planned for transfusion. There is a risk of bleeding complications associated with blood transfusions.
4. Cardiac issues:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), s/p Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction.  Pulmonary edema component resolved.  Excellent progress
   to trach collar.  FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90%.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor (although no abnormalities
   identified at surgery).  CT suggests abscess or tumor.  Plan to
   maintain trach.  Will need re-imaging.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   HYPOTENSION
 resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Goal for MAP >55 mmHg
   (relatively low at  baseline, and currently awake, intteractive
   appropriate, good urine output).
   SEPSIS
 resolved.  Concerns include lung or new abscess (near
   trachea).  Monitor VS.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Now urine output similar to total input.  Would
   reduce iv fluids to maintenance.  Iv fluid bolus for hypotension.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT if progresses.
   CHEST WALL PAIN
 bone pain, focal, point, reproducible with
   palpation.  Suspect Musculo-Skeletal.  Monitor.  Review
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   Neurtropenia resolved now 2 days.  d/c precautions.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction. The cause of this obstruction is unclear, but concerns include laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor. The plan is to maintain the tracheostomy and re-imaging will be necessary.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which is multifactorial including fever, pain, anxiety, sepsis, and possibly cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia. Monitoring vital signs and addressing underlying causes will be important.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced mild relative hypotension during sleep, but it resolved. It was attributed to sepsis. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg.

4. Sepsis: The patient had resolved sepsis, but concerns remain for lung or new abscess near the trachea. Monitoring vital signs and appropriate antimicrobial coverage will be important.

5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored, as they have been receiving intravenous fluids. The goal is to reduce IV fluids to maintenance and ensure adequate urine output.

6. Abdominal pain: The patient has tender G-tube site pain, which has improved. Serial examinations and consideration of an abdominal CT scan may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who presented with stridor and fever. She was found to have narrowed vocal cords with a significantly narrowed airway. An urgent tracheostomy was performed, and she was placed on heliox prior to the procedure. The patient's sepsis/neutropenic fever has resolved, likely originating from a pulmonary source. Her respiratory failure is stable on a tracheostomy mask. Due to tumor infiltration of the vocal cords, chemotherapy has been discontinued. The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely secondary to vagus nerve involvement by the tumor. Anemia has been managed with appropriate response to 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's goal of care at this time is aggressive treatment for her current conditions but no further chemotherapy. She is being monitored for signs of depression and pain management for left flank/low back pain, likely due to metastasis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is currently stable on a tracheostomy mask. However, there is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the airway becomes obstructed or if there are complications from the tracheostomy itself.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's initial sepsis/neutropenic fever has resolved, there is still a risk of developing another infection, especially in an immunocompromised state"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old individual with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. They presented with stridor and fever, and upon examination, narrowed vocal cords with a narrowed airway were identified. An urgent tracheostomy was performed in the operating room with the administration of heliox prior to the procedure.

The patient's previous assessment included sepsis/neutropenic fever, which has since resolved. The likely source of infection was pulmonary, and a chest X-ray showed no progression in disease. The patient is currently being treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime for a full 10-day course, and Clindamycin was given a total of six doses.

The patient also has respiratory failure and is stable on a tracheostomy mask. Due to tumor infiltration of the vocal cords, the patient will not benefit from steroids, and chemotherapy has been discontinued. The tracheostomy tube size is 6, and there are no plans to convert to a larger tracheostomy as the patient may not be able to speak with a larger tube. The patient is using a passed muir valve successfully and reports mild pain over the left lateral lung (previously documented metastasis).

The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia in the 110s, which is likely secondary to tumor involvement of the vagus nerve. Monitoring is recommended.

The patient also has anemia, but the hematocrit (HCT)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. She presented with stridor and fever, and upon examination, she had narrowed vocal cords with a narrowed airway measuring 1-2 mm. An emergency tracheostomy was performed, and she has been placed on a tracheostomy mask. She is currently stable, but her respiratory failure is expected to continue. The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely due to tumor involvement of the vagus nerve. Her anemia is being managed with packed red blood cell transfusions. The patient's goal of care is aggressive treatment for her current conditions but no further chemotherapy. She is also being monitored for signs of depression and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may persist or worsen due to the narrowed airway caused by the tumor. Tracheostomy and tracheostomy mask placement have been done to help maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis/Neutropenic Fever: Although the patient's sepsis/neutropenic fever appears to be resolved, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the source of infection is not completely eradicated. Continued administration of antibiotics is necessary to prevent another episode.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require further management with blood transfusions to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels and oxygen-carrying capacity.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure (upper airway obstruction), s/p Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- mutifactorial; urgent trach for upper airway
   obstruction.  Pulmonary edema component resolved.  Excellent progress
   to trach collar
 now capped.  FiO2 to maintain SaO2 >90%.
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor (although no abnormalities
   identified at surgery).  CT suggests abscess or tumor.  Plan to
   maintain trach.  Will need re-imaging.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus tachycardia; multifactorial including fever, pain,
   anxiety, sepsis, No evidence for pericardial disease.  Also, consider
   cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia.
   HYPOTENSION
 resolved.  Attributed to sepsis.  Goal for MAP >55 mmHg
   (relatively low at  baseline, and currently awake, intteractive
   appropriate, good urine output).
   SEPSIS
 resolved.  Concerns include lung or new abscess (near
   trachea).  Monitor VS.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Now urine output similar to total input.  Would
   reduce iv fluids to maintenance.  Iv fluid bolus for hypotension.
   ABD PAIN -- tender G-tube site improved.  Plan monitor serial exam,
   consider ABD CT if progresses.
   CHEST WALL PAIN
 bone pain, focal, point, reproducible with
   palpation.  Suspect Musculo-Skeletal.  Monitor.  Review
   NEUTROPENIA -- empirical antimicrobial coverage while febrile.
   Neurtropenia resolved now 2 days.  d/c precautions.
   FEVER -- improved.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- plan transfuse to >27.  Use irradiated PRBC.
   LLL lung density -- chronic; possible scarring, residual malignancy

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is upper airway obstruction, which has led to respiratory failure. The cause of the obstruction is unclear but may include laryngospasm, localized abscess, or tumor. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is now on a tracheal collar. Imaging suggests the presence of an abscess or tumor.

The patient also exhibits sinus tachycardia, which is multifactorial including fever, pain, anxiety, sepsis, and possibly cardiomyopathy due to chronic tachycardia. Hypotension has resolved, and the patient's fluid balance has improved. Sepsis has resolved as well, but there are concerns about a possible lung or new abscess near the trachea. The patient's abdominal pain at the G-tube site has improved, but it will be monitored closely. Bone pain is present and may be musculoskeletal in nature. 

The patient had neutropenia, fever, and anemia, which have all improved. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds. The patient has a chronic lung density on the left lower lobe, possibly due to scarring or residual malignancy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, development of new infections, cardiovascular instability, and worsening of the underlying condition causing the airway obstruction.
