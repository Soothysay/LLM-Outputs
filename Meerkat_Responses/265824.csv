","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), delirium/confusion, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). She recently experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and severe three-vessel disease (3VD) was found during cardiac catheterization. The patient is not a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to high risk. She was transferred back to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is now in the ICU for reevaluation.

The patient appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia. She is currently on nitroglycerin and heparin infusions. Her vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/72 mmHg to 138/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, with clear lungs, no jugular venous distention, and normal heart sounds. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no femoral bruits or skin abnormalities. Her laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), and cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. CAD: Continue aspirin, hold off on Plavix until surgical opinion, wean off iv nitro, lipitor, and zestril. Start metoprolol at 25 mg tid and titrate up dose. Get hold of angiography film. Consult cardiology for further management, including consideration of high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with Impella backing if deemed necessary.
2. CHF: The patient is well-compensated at present despite recent MIs and low ejection fraction. Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) here to confirm measurement of high pulmonary artery pressure and severity of AS. Continue CHF medications.
3. AFIB: Patient is currently in sinus rhythm. Continue to monitor on telemetry.
4. AS: Repeat echo on Monday to reassess aortic valve area and stenosis. However, in the setting of severe left ventricular dysfunction and poor forward flow, this may be overestimated.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be secondary to hepatitis C. Repeat platelet level.
6. Prophylaxis: On heparin drip and proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
7. DNR/DNI: Patient has code status of DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reinfarction or unstable angina due to ongoing ischemia.
2. Heart failure exacerbation due to worsening cardiac function or volume overload.
3. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged ICU stay.
5. Thrombocytopenia worsening or development of bleeding complications.
6. Contrast-induced nephropathy due to exposure to iodinated contrast.
7. Aortic dissection or rupture in the setting of severe aortic stenosis."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), delirium/confusion, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). She recently experienced an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed severe three-vessel disease (3VD) that was deemed not amenable to intervention. The patient is now in the ICU for revaluation and consideration of revascularization options.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C (96.9Â°F), heart rate (HR) of 67 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 114/72 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% on nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals no chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, and her respiratory effort is unlabored without the use of accessory muscles. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or bruits. Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

The laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatine kinase (CK), and cardiac troponin-T, as well as elevated liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), delirium/confusion, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). She has recently experienced an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for the option of revascularization. The patient appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CAD: The patient's CAD is currently symptom-free, but enzyme trends should be monitored. Medications such as aspirin, heparin, nitro, lipitor, and metoprolol will be continued or adjusted as per surgical opinion.
2. CHF: The patient is well-compensated for congestive heart failure despite recent MIs and low ejection fraction. A repeat TTE will be done to confirm measurement of high pulmonary artery pressure and severity of AS. Medications like metoprolol, lisinopril, and lasix will be continued.
3. AFIB: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm. Monitoring on tele will continue, and metoprolol will be continued. The reason for not anti-coagulating the patient, likely due to thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk, should be clarified.
4. AS (Aortic Stenosis): A repeat echo will reassess aortic valve area and stenosis. However, in the setting of severe LV dysfunction and poor forward flow, this may be overestimated.

She has been transferred for reevaluation regarding options for revascularization. On arrival, the patient appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia. The patient's chest pain has been resolved, and her NTG drip was restarted earlier in the day. However, her blood pressure dipped from 133/78 to 105/50, and then came back up to the 90s/50s. The patient's urine output (UOP) has been poor, with near 0 UOP from 1pm to 4pm. A bladder scan at 4pm revealed no urine in the bladder. The patient was bolused with 250cc x3, which increased her UOP. The patient's BPs have subsequently remained in the 90s/50s. Metoprolol was decreased from 37.5 TID to 12.5 TID. A repeat echocardiogram showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), right atrial pressure (RAP) of 12-4, ejection fraction (EF) of 50%, peak gradient of 25, valve area of 1.0-1.2, and mild regional dysfunction consistent with CAD.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and recent inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She was admitted to the ICU after being transferred from another hospital for post-MI care and a second opinion regarding coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization 10 days ago and was found to have severe 3-vessel disease that is not amenable to intervention. She has moderate aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0-1.2 cm2.

The patient experienced chest pain earlier in the day and her nitroglycerin (NTG) drip was restarted. Her blood pressure (BP) dipped from 133/78 to 105/50, and chest pain resolved, so NTG was stopped. The BP subsequently remained in the 90s/50s. The patient's urine output (UOP) has been poor, with near 0 UOP from 1 pm to 4 pm. A bladder scan revealed no urine in the bladder, so she was bolused with 250cc x3, which increased her UOP. Her BPs have remained in the 90s/50s, and metoprolol was decreased to 12.5 TID.

A repeat echocardiogram showed symmetric left ventricular hypert"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently experienced a myocardial infarction (MI). She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe three-vessel disease (3VD) that cannot be treated with intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to her high risk. The patient was transferred back to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization options. On arrival, she appeared stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

Medical Complications:
1) CAD/s/p STEMI: The patient's coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent STEMI is a significant medical complication. She remains free of chest pain and her cardiac enzymes (CK/CK-MB) are trending down, indicating improvement. Angiography films from the cardiac catheterization are still pending.
2) Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting acute renal failure. Her urine electrolytes indicate pre-renal azotemia, which could be caused by inadequate urine output. Despite receiving a total of 3286 mL of normal saline (NS) boluses in the past 24 hours, there has been little improvement in her urine output.
3) Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Although the patient's lungs are clear and there is no lower extremity edema, her mildly elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) suggests congestive heart failure"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and has severe triple vessel disease (3VD). She is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's current condition is stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia. The patient has been given aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor, zestril, and metoprolol. The plan is to await the arrival of coronary catheterization films from another hospital and discuss with a cardiologist.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) CAD/s/p STEMI: The patient may experience recurrent myocardial ischemia or infarction, worsening chest pain, or development of heart failure.
2) ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's renal function needs close monitoring due to pre-renal azotemia. If not managed appropriately, it may lead to worsening renal function or the need for dialysis.
3) CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): Although the patient's lungs are clear and there is no lower extremity edema, there is a possibility of developing congestive heart failure due to her severe 3VD. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary.
4) Afib (Atrial Fibrillation): The patient is being managed with rate control medications. If not controlled adequately, it can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
5) AS (Aortic Stenosis"

 maintain I/O even today, IVF boluses as above
   - continue metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and severe triple vessel disease (3VD) that is not amenable to intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She presented with an inferior STEMI and was transferred for reevaluation for the option of revascularization. On arrival, the patient appeared stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

The patient's current medical conditions include acute renal failure (ARF), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), aortic stenosis (AS), thrombocytopenia, and hepatitis C. She is currently receiving IV fluids (IVF) boluses to maintain urine output and renal perfusion, as well as medications such as aspirin, heparin, lipitor, zestril, metoprolol, and ppi.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARF, CHF, AF, AS, and thrombocytopenia. It is important to monitor the patient's kidney function, fluid balance, cardiac status, and coagulation profile closely. Additionally, ongoing assessment of the patient's cardiovascular function and management of her various comorbidities will be necessary."

Her vital signs show a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/58 mmHg to 110/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's urine output has been very low, with only 15-35 cc/hr despite receiving a total of 3,286 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours. Her urine sodium level is 15, indicating possible dehydration or renal dysfunction. Her blood glucose level is elevated at 159 mg/dL. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) are elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial injury.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in atrial flutter. Her electrolyte levels show a slightly low potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L and a normal sodium level of 140 mEq/L. Her renal function tests show a slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL.

The patient has impaired skin integrity with a positive guaiac test, indicating possible bleeding or gastrointestinal bleeding. She is also on heparin, which can contribute to bleeding complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and other medical conditions. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has been experiencing delirium and confusion, atrial flutter, and impaired skin integrity. He is on heparin infusion and receiving multiple medications in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/58 to 110/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in the chest, abdomen, or extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has received a total of 3,286 mL of fluids since admission, with an output of 310 mL of urine and 1,360 mL of pulmonary output. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's urine output is meager, and the urine sodium level is high, which could indicate renal dysfunction or AKI.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests may suggest an ongoing infection or sepsis.
3. Delirium and confusion: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI), severe three vessel disease (3VD), and inferior STEMI. She was deemed not amenable to intervention and considered too high-risk for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) CAD/s/p STEMI: The patient remains cardiopulmonary free over the past 48 hours. Cath films from Hospital1 are currently under review. She will continue aspirin, IV heparin, and Lipitor. Metoprolol and lisinopril are being held. 
2) AF with slow ventricular response: The patient bradycardic to 30-40 yesterday. Temporary wire placement by electrophysiologist (EP) is capturing appropriately. Metoprolol is being held to reduce nodal blockade. The decision to place a permanent pacemaker depends on the decision regarding CABG.
3) PUMP: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 50% (recorded as 15-20% at outside hospital). The patient appears euvolemic, but urine output has been low, and urine electrolytes suggest she is dry. 
4) ARF: Creatinine continues to trend up, now at 2.2. Urine electrolytes have been consistent with pre-renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  Patient remains CP free over past 48 hrs. Cath films
   from [**Hospital1 3633**] currently under review of CT [**Doctor First Name 213**].
   - continue aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs regarding whether CABG/AVR will be offered
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Patient brady to 30-40
   yesterday. Temporary wire placed by EP which is capturing
   appropriately. Metoprolol being held to reduce nodal blockade.
   Decision whether to place permanent pacer dependent on decision
   regarding CABG.
   - f/u EP recs
   - will check underlying rhythm today, timing of pacer will depend on
   whether pt will go for CT-surgery
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #)PUMP: EF 50% (recorded as 15-20% at OSH ECHO). Patient appears
   euvolemic though urine output has been low and urine lytes suggests she
   is dry.
   - check CVP (goal 15)
   - cont small fluid boluses to keep MAPS>60
   - d/c lisinopril
   .
   #) ARF: Cr cont to trend up, now 2.2 Urine lytes have been consistent
   with pre-renal azotemia.
   -recheck urine lytes, eos
   -renally dose all meds
   .
   #) Moderate AS:As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt
   .
   #) Code Status: FULL (confirmed with patient and health care proxies on
   [**7-29**])
   .
   #) Dispo: CCU for now

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Temp vent PM placed yesterday for slow AF in setting of recent IMI, now
   paced 70, with SBP 100.
   Continues with rising Cr 2.1 with poor urine output.
   I reviewed angio from [**Hospital1 3633**] [**2181-7-17**]:   80% distal left main involving
   origin of LAD, 80% ostial RCA.  Also known to have moderate AS and mod
   severe TR.
   Physical Examination
   + JVD.
   Medical Decision Making
   CT surgery requests hepatology consult and will also obtain renal
   consult.  Will then discuss options of AVR/CABG vs high risk stenting
   vs med Rx.   EP to follow and check underlying rhythm to decide re need
   for perm PM.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues.
- She recently had a myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed severe triple vessel disease (3VD) that could not be intervened upon and she was considered a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- The patient was transferred back to the outside hospital with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is now in the ICU for reevaluation for the option of revascularization.
- On arrival, the patient appeared stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
- The patient remains cardiopulmonary-free over the past 48 hours.
- Aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor are continued.
- Metoprolol and lisinopril are being held.
- Awaiting CT surgery recommendations regarding whether CABG or aortic valve replacement (AVR) will be offered.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response and temporary wire placement by electrophysiology (EP) for pacing.
- Metoprolol is being held to reduce nodal blockade.
- Decision whether to place a permanent pacemaker will depend on the decision regarding CABG.
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 50% according to the most recent measurement, although it was previously recorded as 15-20% at the outside hospital echocardiogram (ECHO).
- The patient appears euvolemic but has low urine output, suggesting she may be dry.
- Central venous pressure (CVP) should be checked, aiming for a goal of 15.
- Small fluid boluses should be continued to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
- Lisinopril should be discontinued.
- The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) continues to trend upward, now at 2.2.
- Urine electrolytes have been consistent with pre-renal azotemia.
- Renal dosing of all medications should be considered.
- The patient has moderate aortic stenosis (AS).
- Consultation with cardiac surgery has been requested to discuss possible AVR/CABG.
- The patient's platelet count remains stable.
- Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and heparin are being administered.
- The patient's code status is full.
- Disposition is to continue in the coronary critical care unit (CCU).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications:
- Continued presence of atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.
- Severe 3VD with ongoing ischemia.
- Moderate AS may lead to symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmias.
- Risk of further myocardial infarction.

2. Renal complications:
- Rising serum creatinine levels indicating potential acute kidney injury.
- Pre-renal azotemia suggests inadequate renal perfusion.
- Low urine output may indicate urinary tract obstruction or intrinsic renal injury.

3. Respiratory complications:
- Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
- Retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray.
- Risk of pneumonia or worsening respiratory distress.

4. Bleeding complications:
- Use of anticoagulants such as heparin and aspirin.
- Risk of bleeding, especially with concomitant use of medications like lisinopril.

5. Infection complications:
- Prophylactic antibiotics may be indicated due to indwelling lines and devices.
- Risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
- Risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's health progress and potential complications based on the provided progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and recent hospitalization for chest pain. The patient presented with bradycardia and was found to have atrial flutter. An external temporary pacemaker was placed, and the patient's heart rhythm stabilized. The patient's low blood pressure was treated with fluid resuscitation, and a right internal jugular pacer lead was inserted. The patient's lung volumes are low, suggesting bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential renal dysfunction. This may be due to hypoperfusion or direct injury to the kidneys.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction, which can lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status is altered, as evidenced by delirium and confusion. This can be attributed to various factors such as sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or medication effects.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, which can lead to pressure ulcers or infections if not properly managed.
5. Atrial flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which is an abnormal heart rhythm that can increase the risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who has experienced recent myocardial infarction (MI) and severe three-vessel disease (3VD). She was deemed not amenable to intervention and is now presenting with an inferior STEMI. The patient's condition remains stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CAD/s/p STEMI: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). There is a risk of further cardiac events or complications such as recurrent ischemia, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

2. AF with slow ventricular response: The patient experienced bradycardia with a heart rate of 30-40 beats per minute. Temporary wire placement by an electrophysiologist (EP) was done, which is capturing appropriately. The patient's metoprolol medication is being held to reduce nodal blockade. There is a potential risk of developing complete heart block or other cardiac rhythm disturbances.

3. PUMP dysfunction: The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. There is a risk of heart failure or worsening cardiac function due to compromised pumping ability of the heart.

4. Moderate AS: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis (AS). There is a potential risk of symptoms worsening, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, or syn"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently had a myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization showed severe three vessel disease (3VD) that cannot be treated with intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to the patient's high risk status. The patient returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and was transferred for reevaluation to consider revascularization. Upon arrival, the patient appeared stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

The patient has been receiving aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor, zestril, and metoprolol. Awaiting the recommendations of the cardiologist regarding whether CABG/AVR will be offered.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AF) with a slow ventricular response and a temporary wire placed by the electrophysiologist (EP) which is capturing appropriately. Metoprolol is being held to reduce nodal blockade. The decision to place a permanent pacer will depend on the decision regarding CABG.

Additionally, the patient has a low urine output and the urine electrolytes suggest pre-renal azotemia. The patient's creatinine level is rising, and renal dosing of medications is recommended.

The patient also has moderate aortic stenosis (AS), and consultation has been made with the cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss possible aortic valve replacement (AVR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unclear chief complaint. The patient received a 500cc bolus due to a low systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s, resulting in bradycardia and the discontinuation of beta-blockers. An electrocardiologist was consulted, and the patient underwent temporary pacing with a set rate in the 70s. A chest X-ray revealed a right internal jugular (IJ) pacer lead terminating in the right ventricle without any pneumothorax. The patient also has low lung volumes, likely bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, as well as a retrocardiac opacity. CT-surgery obtained cath films from [**Hospital1**]. Repeat labs showed sodium levels at 131 and creatinine levels at 2.2. The patient was given 1 liter of normal saline intravenously over 3 hours, resulting in an urine output of 10-25cc/hr overnight. Urine sodium levels were measured at 15.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia after receiving a 500cc bolus, which can be a result of volume overload or an adverse reaction to the fluid administration.
2. Paced rhythm: The patient is currently on temporary pacing with a set rate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including hepatitis C, cardiac disease, renal failure, liver disease, and thrombocytopenia. She recently experienced a myocardial infarction and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe three-vessel disease that was not amenable to intervention. The patient's current condition includes acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, moderate aortic stenosis, and inferior STEMI. The patient's liver disease is being evaluated for possible hepatocellular carcinoma, and she also has a history of intraventricular thrombus. The patient's platelet count remains stable, but her creatinine level is elevated at 2.1, indicating renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis C: This chronic viral infection can lead to liver damage and increase the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
2. Cardiac Disease: The patient has severe three-vessel disease and a history of myocardial infarction, which puts her at high risk for further cardiac events such as heart attack or heart failure.
3. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine level suggests acute kidney injury, which may be reversible or progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed.
4. Liver Disease: The patient's liver disease needs further evaluation to determine the nature and severity of the condition. If hepatocellular carcinoma is present, it may require treatment options such as liver transplantation or"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  Cont to be chest pain free. Cath films under review
   by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] (CABG vs high risk stent)
   - continue aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs regarding whether CABG/AVR will be offered if
   not then possible high risk stenting
   - awaiting liver recs (obtaining prior MRI)

   placement. HRs remain in the 60
s-70

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   No chest pain.    Quite weak.   Poor urine output 250 cc.   Cr 2.1.
   Appreciate renal and hepatology input.
   I reviewed angio showing tight left main extending in ostial LAD and
   tight ostial RCA, both amenable to stenting.
   Medical Decision Making
   Liver team may need repeat MRI to fully characterize liver lesions.
   Will continue to monitor renal function and revasc will need to await
   renal function improvement.
   Eventually may be better candidate for high risk stenting rather than
   CABG/AVR.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including hepatitis C, history of myocardial infarction (MI), and severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (3VD). She recently had an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being evaluated for revascularization options.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of hepatitis C, which can lead to chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The presence of liver lesions should be further evaluated to determine if they represent HCC.
2. Severe 3VD: The patient has severe 3VD, which is not amenable to intervention and poses a high risk for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This increases the risk of future cardiac events.
3. Inferior STEMI: The patient recently experienced an inferior STEMI, indicating a lack of blood supply to the heart muscle. This could lead to further damage to the heart if not properly managed.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level, suggesting possible AKI. This could be due to pre-existing chronic kidney disease, contrast-induced nephropathy from recent cardiac catheterization, or poor cardiac output.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including hepatitis C, who recently experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and has severe triple vessel disease (3VD) deemed not amenable to intervention or suitable for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was transferred to the ICU with an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization options. The patient appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CAD/s/p STEMI: The patient has severe 3VD and is a high-risk candidate for CABG. Revascularization options are being considered, but there is a risk of complications associated with the procedure.
2. AF with slow ventricular response: The patient's heart rhythm is currently atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Temporary pacing wires have been placed, and the decision to place a permanent pacemaker will depend on the decision regarding CABG.
3. PUMP dysfunction: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF 50%) and appears euvolemic, but with low urine output. Fluid management will be important to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating renal dysfunction. Pre-renal azotemia is suspected, and close monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is necessary.
5. Moderate AS (Aortic Stenosis): The patient has moderate aortic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C infection since 1993, resulting from a blood transfusion. He underwent a splenectomy at that time. The patient has been followed by Dr. [Last Name] of [Hospital1]. He has had multiple biopsies of liver lesions at [Hospital3]. The patient never received interferon treatment.

The patient presented to the hospital with congestive heart failure (CHF) and was found to have an estimated central venous pressure (CVP) of 15, which was later estimated to be around 12. An electrophysiology study (EP) was performed, and a temporary wire was kept in place, with the decision to defer the decision of pacemaker placement for now.

The patient's liver function tests showed elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), indicating possible liver damage. Additionally, the patient had elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels of 56.5, which may suggest hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Renal function tests revealed acute kidney injury (AKI), possibly due to atheroembolic or contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient's urine eosinophil levels were negative, and follow-up urine sodium levels were less than 10.

An echocardiogram (echo) was reviewed by [Doctor First Name],"

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C infection since 1993, resulting from a blood transfusion. He has had multiple biopsies of liver lesions at Hospital3. The patient has not received interferon treatment. He presents with high central venous pressure (CVP) and an estimated 12 CVP, indicating possible fluid overload. There is also evidence of renal impairment with elevated creatinine levels and signs of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has been experiencing urinary tract infections, as indicated by dirty urinalysis. He has been prescribed ciprofloxacin. The patient's echocardiogram shows inferior wall motion abnormality and right ventricular hypokinesis, suggestive of a right ventricular infarct. There are also findings of multivessel coronary artery disease, with significant blockages in the right coronary artery and distal left main coronary artery. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 93/56 to 131/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently experienced a myocardial infarction (MI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have severe three vessel disease (3VD) that was deemed not amenable to intervention and considered a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 

The patient presented to the outside hospital with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was transferred for revaluation for the option of revascularization. Upon arrival, the patient appeared stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

The patient's medical conditions and plans include:

1. CAD/s/p STEMI: The patient is currently chest pain-free, and cardiac catheterization films are under review by Dr. [**Doctor First Name 213**]. The plan is to continue aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor. Metoprolol and lisinopril are being held, and recommendations regarding CABG/AVR will be provided by Dr. [**Doctor First Name 213**].

2. AF with slow ventricular response: The patient had a temporary pacemaker placement. The heart rate remains in the 60s-70s, and follow-up electrocardiogram (EP) recommendations are pending. The timing of pacer placement will depend on whether the patient will undergo CT-surgery (could have pacer placed at that time),"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently experienced an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for revascularization. She has severe 3VD that is not amenable to intervention and is also a high-risk candidate for CABG. The patient appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxic, possibly due to volume overload and pulmonary edema. She is receiving non-rebreather oxygen and has been placed on a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10L. Lasix gtt has been started, and the option of ultrafiltration is being considered. Intubation and code status have been discussed with the family.

2) Atrial Fibrillation with slow ventricular response: The patient is experiencing AF with a slow ventricular response. Temporary pacemaker rate has been reduced to 40, which resulted in a heart rate mainly in the 40s-60s. Cardioversion to sinus rhythm is being considered, especially if the patient undergoes cardiac surgery. The patient is currently on telemetry monitoring.

3) Coronary Artery Disease/Previous STEMI: The patient's CT surgery recommendations regarding CABG/AVR are pending assessment of liver disease. The patient remains chest pain-free and may be amenable to high-risk stenting. She is currently on aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including severe 3VD deemed not amenable to intervention and considered a too high risk candidate for CABG. She recently experienced an inferior STEMI and is being evaluated for the option of revascularization. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia related to volume overload and pulmonary edema. She is receiving lasix gtt to address this issue. 

The patient also has CAD/s/p STEMI, AF with slow ventricular response, PUMP failure, ARF (acute renal failure), moderate AS (aortic stenosis), thrombocytopenia, and HepC. 

The plan includes continuing aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor, while holding metoprolol and lisinopril. Temporary pacemaker rate has been reduced to 40, and the patient will be monitored on telemetry. Dopamine is being given as needed to keep MAPs >60, and lasix gtt is also being continued. Lisinopril is being held. 

Renal function is being closely monitored, and medications are being dosed accordingly to avoid nephrotoxins. Consultation has been made with CT surgeon to discuss possible AVR/CABG. The patient's thrombocytopenia is thought to be secondary to hepatitis C. Hepatology is reviewing OSH liver MRI, and the patient may need a repeat liver MR once her liver function improves.

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including recent myocardial infarction (MI) and severe three-vessel disease that is not amenable to intervention. She has been transferred from an outside hospital with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) for re-evaluation for the option of revascularization. 

The patient appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia. However, she is experiencing hypoxia related to volume overload and pulmonary edema, as indicated by her low oxygen saturation levels on a non-rebreather mask and her recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results. To address this, lasix gtt has been started.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, which is being monitored on telemetry. An EP study is recommended, and the timing of a pacemaker will depend on whether the patient undergoes cardiac surgery.

The patient's pump function is compromised, with increased pulmonary edema and lower extremity edema. This is likely due to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and subsequent poor forward flow. Continuous dopamine infusion is being given to keep mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60, and lasix gtt is being continued. Lisinopril has been held.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF) with elevated creatinine levels, likely due to an evolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN). ACE inhibitors are being held,"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Related to volume overload and pulmonary edema and now 10L
   positive LOS. Pt continues to be hypoxic to low 90s on non-rebreather
   with most recent ABG 7.40/ 27 / 64
   - starting lasix gtt
   - will speak to [**Year (4 digits) **] if ultrafiltration is an option
   - cont non-rebreather, speak to family about intubation and code status
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Temporary pacemaker rate reduced
   to 40 yesterday which resulted in HR mainly in the 40
s-60
s.  Because
   of pt
s IMI pt preload dependent and CO may improve some if
   cardioverted with return of atrial kick.
   - will speak to EP on cardioverting to sinus
   -  timing of pacer will depend on whether pt will go for CT-surgery
   (could have pacer placed at that time)
   -  monitor on telemetry
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  CT surgery recommendations re: CABG/AVR pending
   hepatology
s assessment of liver disease. Patient remains chest pain
   free. Waiting on return of [**Year (4 digits) **] function. Pt may be amenable to
   high-risk stenting
   - continue aspirin, IV heparin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   #) PUMP: Patient appearing more volume overloaded- CXR with increased
   pulm edema, increased lower ext edema. Likely this is a combination of
   RV dysfunction and subsequent poor forward flow and continued [**Doctor First Name **]
   insufficiency. CVP now in the 20
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60
   - lasix gtt
   - holding lisinopril.
   - speak to [**Doctor First Name **] about ultrafiltration
   .
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.3. (Baseline of 0.7). Likely
   represents an evolving ATN.  A contributing factor is likely her poor
   forward flow versus contrast nephropathy from recent cath. We will cont
   to hold ACE at this time. Cr is currently plataued

   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including severe 3VD deemed not amenable to intervention and considered too high risk for CABG. She has a history of recent MI, cardiac catheterization, inferior STEMI, and revascularization options being considered. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia related to volume overload and pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, coronary artery disease post STEMI, pump failure, acute renal failure, moderate aortic stenosis, thrombocytopenia, hepatitis C, and urinary tract infection. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.2Â°C (95.4Â°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/53 mmHg to 135/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 3 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and central venous pressure of 21 mmHg. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, troponin-T, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. 

The plan includes continuing non-rebreather oxygen, dopamine infusion to maintain MAPs above 60, Lasix gtt, holding lisinopril, and discussing ultrafiltration.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed severe three-vessel disease (3VD) that is not amenable to intervention, and the patient is considered a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient was subsequently returned to the outside hospital with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and has been transferred for reevaluation to consider options for revascularization.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia due to volume overload and pulmonary edema. Oxygen supplementation with a non-rebreather mask has been initiated, and Lasix gtt has been started to address fluid overload. The possibility of ultrafiltration is being considered.
- Atrial Fibrillation with slow ventricular response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Temporary pacemaker rate has been reduced to 40 beats per minute, which resulted in a heart rate mainly in the 40s-60s. Cardioversion is being considered to convert the patient to sinus rhythm, especially if the patient undergoes cardiac surgery (could have pacemaker placed at that time). Telemetry monitoring is ongoing.
- CAD/s/p STEMI: Recommendations from the cardiologist regarding CABG/AVR are pending"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial flutter. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), and altered elimination related to diarrhea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/53 to 135/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 3 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with dopamine and heparin infusions.

The patient has a history of decreased urine output and increased oxygen requirement. Despite receiving lasix, there has been minimal increase in urine output. The patient's renal function is deteriorating as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

The patient's cardiac status shows atrial fibrillation and faint S2 heart sound. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases with scattered crackles, trace lower extremity edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, admitted to the ICU for evaluation and treatment of various conditions. The patient has been experiencing altered elimination due to diarrhea, acute renal failure, coronary artery disease, delirium/confusion, atrial flutter, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/53 to 135/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 3 inspirations per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 21 mmHg. The patient is receiving dopamine infusion and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which may lead to further deterioration of kidney function, fluid imbalance, electrolyte disturbances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
2. Coronary artery disease: The patient's pre-existing coronary artery disease increases the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina during the ICU stay.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status is altered, which can be caused by various factors such as medication side effects, infection, metabolic imbalances, or organ dysfunction. Delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, inadequate oxygenation, and prolonged ICU stay.

   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently had a myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization showed severe three-vessel disease that was not amenable to intervention, and the patient was considered too high-risk for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was subsequently transferred to an outside hospital with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is now being evaluated for the possibility of revascularization.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. CAD/s/p STEMI: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and a recent inferior STEMI. She is currently stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia. The plan is to continue aspirin, IV heparin, and lipitor. Metoprolol and lisinopril are being held, and the patient awaits CT surgery recommendations regarding CABG/AVR after a hepatology assessment of liver disease.

2. AF with slow ventricular response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Temporary pacemaker rate was reduced to 40 yesterday, resulting in a heart rate mainly in the 40s-60s. Follow-up electrophysiology recommendations are pending, and the timing of the pacemaker will depend on whether the patient will undergo CT-surgery (could have the pacemaker placed at that time). The patient is being monitored"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently experienced an inferior STEMI and was transferred for reevaluation for the option of revascularization. Upon arrival, the patient appeared stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia. The patient has severe 3VD that is not amenable to intervention, making her a high-risk candidate for CABG. 

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxia related to volume overload and pulmonary edema, as shown by a positive LOS on the most recent chest X-ray. The patient's oxygen saturation levels are in the low 90s on non-rebreather. Diuretics (lasix gtt and diuril) have been initiated for diuresis, and consideration may be given to starting ultrafiltration if diuresis becomes less effective. Oxygen therapy via non-rebreather will continue, with plans to wean as tolerated to maintain sats >92%.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, and the pacer rate has been increased to 80 to improve stroke volume. Cardioversion may be considered, but only after the patient's volume status improves. Telemetry monitoring will be continued.

The patient's pump function is in acute CHF, likely due to impaired left and right ventricular function. Aggressive diuresis is being attempted to improve forward flow dynamics. Dopamine will be continued to maintain MAPs >60, and lisinopril will"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently experienced an inferior STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have severe 3VD that is not amenable to intervention. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, acute CHF, and acute kidney injury. She also has moderate aortic stenosis, thrombocytopenia, and hepatitis C. The patient is currently in the ICU and her code status is set to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and previous pulmonary edema indicate potential respiratory distress. Further respiratory support may be required, and careful monitoring of oxygen levels is necessary.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Slow Ventricular Response: The patient's heart rhythm is currently abnormal, leading to a slow heart rate. This can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other cardiac complications. Cardioversion may be considered once the patient's volume status improves.
3. Acute CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient's impaired forward flow dynamics and evidence of CHF suggest ongoing cardiac dysfunction. Aggressive diuresis and continuous monitoring are needed to manage fluid balance and cardiac output.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The elevated creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction, likely due to a combination of impaired forward flow and possible contrast nephropathy."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently had a myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. She was found to have severe three-vessel disease (3VD) that is not amenable to intervention, and she is considered a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and was transferred for reevaluation for the option of revascularization. Upon arrival, the patient appeared stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing hypoxia due to volume overload and pulmonary edema. Although the most recent chest X-ray shows some improvement, the patient continues to have low oxygen saturation levels on a non-rebreather mask. Continued use of lasix gtt and diuril for diuresis is recommended. If diuresis becomes less effective, starting CV V H may be considered. Oxygen therapy should be continued via a non-rebreather mask and weaned as tolerated to maintain oxygen saturation levels above 92%.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with slow ventricular response: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. The pacer rate has been increased to 80 to improve stroke volume. It is suspected that the patient relies on atrial kick, and cardioversion may be considered once the patient's volume status"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including severe three vessel disease deemed not amenable to intervention and considered a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She has had a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and an inferior STEMI. 

She presents with hypoxia due to volume overload and pulmonary edema. Diuretics are being continued, and the possibility of ultrafiltration is being considered if diuresis becomes less effective. Oxygen therapy is also ongoing, with the goal of maintaining oxygen saturation above 92%.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, and the pacer rate has been increased to 80 to improve stroke volume. Cardioversion is being considered, but it will be postponed until the patient's volume status improves. An electrophysiology study is recommended, and permanent pacing may be required.

The patient is also experiencing acute congestive heart failure (CHF), likely due to impaired left ventricular function and right ventricular function. Aggressive diuresis is being attempted to improve forward flow dynamics. Dopamine is being administered to maintain mean arterial pressures above 60. Lasix gtt and diuril are also being continued, and lisinopril is being held.

Regarding the patient's coronary artery disease (CAD) following a STEMI, cardiac surgery recommendations for CABG and aortic valve replacement (AVR) are pending an assessment of liver disease."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, and coronary artery disease. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple episodes of hypotension and hypoxia. The patient received ciprofloxacin at 10:00 AM. Dopamine was started at 10 mcg/kg/min. Lasix was initiated, and diuretics were adjusted to improve urine output. Repeat chest X-ray showed improved edema. The pacer was set to 80 beats per minute. The patient desaturated to 70-80's on the monitor, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.45, PaCO2 25, HCO3 61, O2 sat 91%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 61. The patient's I/O output was 1.4L over 24 hours.

Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which can lead to irregular heart rhythms and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient may be at risk for a UTI due to urinary catheterization and immobility. Symptoms may include fever, urgency, frequency, dysuria, and suprapubic pain.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. ARF can be caused by various factors, including hypoperfusion, nephrotoxins, or obstructive uropathy.

4. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute: The patient's diastolic heart failure may be exacerbated by his underlying coronary artery disease. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue.

5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, which can lead to myocardial ischemia and infarction if not managed properly.

6. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors, including medications, electrolyte imbalances, or the underlying medical conditions.

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be required to confirm these conditions and determine appropriate treatment plans."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and experiencing several medical complications. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypoxia and decreased urine output. The patient was given diuretics to improve urine output, and there was an improvement in the patient's condition as evidenced by increased urine output and improved chest X-ray results.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/53 to 117/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is also on dopamine infusion at a rate of 10 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases with scattered crackles, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), regular heart rhythm with pacemaker, and no lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 123 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL, high potassium level of 5.7 mEq/L, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 19 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 2.7 mmol/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Related to volume overload and pulmonary edema (9.5L
   positive LOS) though most recent CXR shows some improvement. She
   continues to sat in the low 90
s on non-rebreather. Most recent  ABG
   7.45/25/61/18
   - cont lasix gtt and diuril for diuresis. Would consider starting UF if
   diuresis becomes less effective
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: Pacer rate increased to 80
   yesterday in an effort to improve stroke volume. We suspect that
   patient is reliant on atrial kick and would consider cardioversion but
   are holding off on this until her volume status improves.
   - f/u EP recs (consider amio vs. cardioversion)
   - will likely require permanent pacer
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Continues to be in acute CHF. Likely this is a function of
   both impaired [**Year (4 digits) **] and RV function. We are attempting to aggressively
   diurese her at this time to improve forward flow dynamics.
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60
   - lasix gtt and diuril
   - holding lisinopril.
   - f/u [**Year (4 digits) **] recs
   .
   #) CAD/s/p STEMI:  CT surgery recommendations re: CABG/AVR pending
   hepatology
s assessment of liver disease. Patient remains chest pain
   free. Waiting on return of [**Year (4 digits) **] function. Pt may be amenable to
   high-risk stenting
   - continue aspirin, lipitor
   -  holding metoprolol and lisinopril
   - awaiting CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - restart IV heparin after discussion with [**Doctor First Name **] regarding possible
   line placement
   .
   #) ARF: Cr remains elevated at 2.4. (Baseline of 0.7). We feel this is
   most likely ATN. The etiology likely being a combination of impaired
   forward flow and possibly contrast nephropathy. We cont to avoid
   nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications.
   - f/u [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   .
   #) UTI: Urine cx from [**7-31**] + for fecal contamination. Will hold off on
   further ABX and recheck a UA/Ucx.
   .
   #) Moderate AS: As noted above, we have consulted CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] to discuss
   possible AVR/CABG
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plts remain stable. Question of splenectomy
   secondary to ITP.
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   .
   #) HepC:  Hepatology reviewing OSH liver MRI. She will likely need a
   repeat liver MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] function improves in order to assess whether
   known liver lesions increasing in size.
   - f/u liver recs
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - PPI, Heparin gtt

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues who recently experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed severe three-vessel disease (3VD) that is not amenable to intervention, and the patient is considered a high-risk candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was transferred back to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and returned for reevaluation to consider the option of revascularization. Upon arrival, the patient appeared stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing volume overload and pulmonary edema, although there is some improvement in the most recent chest X-ray. She continues to have low oxygen saturation levels on non-rebreather. Diuretics are being continued for diuresis, and the possibility of starting ultrafiltration if diuresis becomes less effective is being considered. Oxygen therapy via non-rebreather will be continued and weaned as tolerated to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with slow ventricular response: The patient's pacer rate was increased to 80 yesterday in an effort to improve stroke volume. It is suspected that the patient is relying on atrial kick, and cardioversion may be considered. However, it is being held off until the patient's volume status improves. Electrocardiogram ("

   - Temp dialysis line placed for CVVH -> initially CVVH started at
   50cc/h, tolerated well and increased to 75cc/h overnight
   - Diuril and Lasix were d/c'd with fluid being removed from CVVH
   - At 8pm pt had 20sec run of NSVT
   - Liver: pt [**Name (NI) 8301**] class A now b/c of improved albumin, HCC still
   possiblity, imaging when renal fxn improves
   - UA showed 6 WBC, neg Nitrites, neg bact -> did not tx
   - CXR ""Little change except for slightly lower lung volumes.""
   - Did not give Amio, day nurse was busy and did not give, then later
   CVVH helping and held off on Amio
   - Attempted A-line but unsuccesful
   - Around 3am pt's BP started dropping nadired to 73/40s, decreased CVVH
   to 50cc/h, with some improvement, but eventually had to increase
   dopamine to 20. Since DA was maxed at 20 our next step was to start Neo
   and ordered it but did not need to give, MAPs remained > 55 o DA 20.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Cont to require FM to keep O2 sats >92%. We feel hypoxia
   related to sig volume overload. Attempting to remove fluid with CVVH
   given diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril unsuccessful.
   - cont CVVH
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) Hypotension: Now has increased dopamine requriement to 20mg/hr.
   Hypotension likely related to iniating CVVH.
   - try and wean dopa
   - monitor LEs which appear blue, though cap refill intact
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: We have turned pacer down to 30.
   Native rhythm currently stable. We feel she would benefit from being in
   sinus rhythm but are holding off on cardioversion until we can remove
   more fluid given concern that she would likely revert back to Afib at
   this time if we cardiovert her. We will give her a loading dose of
   amiodarone today. Keep temp wire in while giving amio.
   - f/u EP recs
   - cont heparin gtt
   - will likely require permanent pacer
   -  monitor on telemetry
   .
   #) PUMP: Continues to be in acute CHF. Likely this is a function of
   both impaired renal and RV function. Temnp HD line placed and CVVH
   initiated yesterday.
   - cont dopamine as needed to keep MAPs >60, but try to wean
   - holding lisinopril.
   - f/u renal recs

   Total time spent on patient care: 50 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   MI, CVVHD, hypotension, shock, afib, renal failure
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including severe 3VD (triple vessel disease), recent MI (myocardial infarction), and an inferior STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction).
- The patient has been returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is transferred for reevaluation for the option of revascularization.
- On arrival, the patient appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
- The patient requires FM (oxygen supplementation) to keep O2 sats >92%.
- The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely related to initiating CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis).
- The patient has AFib (atrial fibrillation) with a slow ventricular response and is currently being paced.
- The patient's pump (heart) is in acute CHF (congestive heart failure) due to impaired renal and RV (right ventricular) function.
- The patient has ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH, likely due to ATN (acute tubular necrosis).
- The patient's UTI (urinary tract infection) is negative.
- The patient has moderate AS (aortic stenosis) and is awaiting CT surgery recommendations for AVR/CABG (aortic valve replacement/coronary artery bypass grafting).
- The patient has thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), which"

   24 Hour Events:
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2181-8-3**] 03:30 PM
 DIALYSIS CATHETER - START [**2181-8-3**] 03:30 PM
   - Temp dialysis line placed for CVVH -> initially CVVH started at
   50cc/h, tolerated well and increased to 75cc/h overnight
   - Diuril and Lasix were d/c'd with fluid being removed from CVVH
   - At 8pm pt had 20sec run of NSVT
   - Liver: pt [**Name (NI) 8301**] class A now b/c of improved albumin, HCC still
   possiblity, imaging when renal fxn improves
   - UA showed 6 WBC, neg Nitrites, neg bact -> did not tx
   - CXR ""Little change except for slightly lower lung volumes.""
   - Did not give Amio, day nurse was busy and did not give, then later
   CVVH helping and held off on Amio
   - Attempted A-line but unsuccesful
   - Around 3am pt's BP started dropping nadired to 73/40s, decreased CVVH
   to 50cc/h, with some improvement, but eventually had to increase
   dopamine to 20. Since DA was maxed at 20 our next step was to start Neo
   and ordered it but did not need to give, MAPs remained > 55 o DA 20.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Cont to require FM to keep O2 sats >92%. We feel hypoxia
   related to sig volume overload. Attempting to remove fluid with CVVH
   given diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril unsuccessful.
   - cont CVVH
   - cont O2 via non-rebreather and wean as tolerated to keep sats> 92%
   .
   #) Hypotension: Now has increased dopamine requriement to 20mg/hr.
   Hypotension likely related to iniating CVVH.
   - try and wean dopa
   - monitor LEs which appear blue, though cap refill intact
   .
   #) AF with slow ventricular response: We have turned pacer down to 30.
   Native rhythm currently stable. We feel she would benefit from being in
   sinus rhythm but are holding off on cardioversion until we can remove
   more fluid given concern that she would likely revert back to Afib at
   this time if we cardiovert her. We will give her a loading dose of
   amiodarone today. Keep temp wire in while giving amio.
   - f/u EP recs

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical issues, including severe 3VD (three vessel disease), recent myocardial infarction (MI), inferior STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction), and acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.2Â°C (97.1Â°F)
- Heart rate: 82 bpm (with a ventricular paced rhythm)
- Blood pressure: 91/63 mmHg (with readings ranging from 77/23 to 108/68 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 92% on face tent with supplemental oxygen

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases with scattered crackles, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), rapid heart rate (rr), faint second heart sound (s2), and evidence of volume overload. There is no lower extremity edema or stasis dermatitis/ulcers/scars/xanthomas on the skin.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 10.2 K/uL
- Platelet count: 101 K/uL
- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 34 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 2"
