","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia who presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia, hypotension, and amiodarone infusion. The patient has undergone three failed ventricular tachycardia ablations in the past. The current plan is to continue amiodarone infusion, switch to oral dosing, and consider switching to dronedarone in the future. The patient's labs show normal results for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/65 mmHg to 113/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is mildly volume overloaded and will be monitored closely for any changes. The plan is to continue the current medications, including toremide, beta-blockers, eplerenone, ACE inhibitors, and statins. The patient is also on prophylactic anticoagulation with Coumadin and has a full code status. The patient will be kept NPO overnight into Monday for a possible procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia who presented with recurrent VT, hypotension, and amiodarone infusion. The patient has undergone three prior ablations for VT and has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place. The patient's ICD interrogation revealed slow VT but appropriate firing of the ICD. The patient has failed medical management with mexiletine/tikosyn and insurance approval for dronedarone could not be obtained. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/65 mmHg to 113/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable vital signs but with mild volume overload. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension (HTN), and congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and kidney function. However, the patient's potassium level is low at 2.2 mEq/L, magnesium level is low at 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose level is elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia (VT) who presented with recurrent VT and hypotension. He has undergone three prior ablations for VT and has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place. The patient's rhythm interrogation showed slow VT, but appropriate firing of the ICD. He has failed medical management with mexiletine/tikosyn, and insurance approval for dronedarone could not be obtained. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, omeprazole, metoprolol, and valium.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/56 mmHg to 81/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination is notable for a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), few crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally, mild abdominal distention, and soft and non-tender abdomen.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. However, the patient's potassium levels are low at 2.2 mEq/L, and his INR is elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia (VT) who presented with recurrent VT, hypotension, and amiodarone infusion. He has undergone three prior ablations for VT, and his ICD interrogation showed appropriate firing of the device. The patient has failed medical management with mexiletine/tikosyn and is awaiting insurance approval for dronedarone. His current medications include amiodarone, omeprazole, lidocaine, and midazolam. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he is mildly volume overloaded. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recurrent VT. The patient has a low ejection fraction of 15% due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. He has a history of coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient's blood pressure has been recently unstable, and his electrolytes need close monitoring. He is currently in the cardiac care unit (CCU) and will be there until his ablation procedure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of VT and has experienced recurrent episodes during his hospital stay. This condition can be life-threatening and may require further interventions such as another ablation or changes in antiarrhythmic medication.
2. Hypotension: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia (VT) who presented with recurrent VT, hypotension, and amiodarone infusion. The patient has undergone three prior ablations for VT and has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 70 bpm with a range of 70-143 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74/51 mmHg to 96/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general appearance, HEENT, neck, or lungs. However, the cardiac examination shows a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and no murmurs, thrills, lifts, or signs of heart failure. The abdomen is described as soft with mild abdominal distention, and there are no extremity abnormalities noted.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and glucose, as well as slightly low hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet count (Plt). Other electrolyte levels are within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia (VT) who presented to the ICU with recurrent VT and hypotension. The patient has undergone three prior ablations for VT and has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient's vital signs are currently stable with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 96/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is receiving amiodarone by continuous infusion, lidocaine boluses, and epinephrine. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and there are no significant abnormalities in liver function tests. The patient's main concerns include recurrent VT, hypotension, and the need for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VT: The patient's history of VT and previous ablations indicate a high risk for recurrent episodes. Close monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm is essential to promptly address any new episodes of VT.
2. Hypotension: The patient's current hypotension may be related to the recent episode of VT. It is crucial to maintain adequate blood pressure to ensure organ perfusion and prevent further complications.
3. Amiodarone toxicity: Amiodarone has potential side effects including liver toxicity. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended to assess"

   not new ischemia as discussed with EP.  Due to VT refractory to medical
   management, team now feels that heart transplant is patient
s best
   option; discussed with and accepted by [**Hospital1 586**].

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, who presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was refractory to medical management. The patient has undergone three failed ablations in the past and has had six shocks from an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/39 mmHg to 83/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including amiodarone, lidocaine, heparin, midazolam, and fentanyl. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and crackles at the lung bases bilaterally. The patient has mild abdominal distention but no other significant findings on abdominal examination. 

The patient's blood flow data shows an input/output balance with some fluctuations. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in assist/control mode with a set respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, tidal volume"
