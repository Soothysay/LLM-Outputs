   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 One bcx culture yesterday positive for GPCs, started
   vanco.  Patient was progressively more tachycardic and hypotensive last
   night, requiring 4L of fluid yesterday, and eventually pressors.  First
   dopamine, which we d/c
ed [**1-4**] SVT, then norepinephrine.  We also
   started linezolid for VRE, and continued cipro/flagyl to cover GI gram
   negatives and anerobes.  Had lengthy discussion with family  regarding
   goals, and whether we should place a CVL and a-line.  They are
   undecided.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - likely place CVL for pressor support
   - continue aggressive IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro flagyl
   - follow up blood cultures
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: No further episodes of diarrhea.
   Gastroenterology plans EGD today, will update them  regarding
   hemodynamic instability.  Stool cultures, c. diff toxin pending.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fugating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), but could be
   other cause including mesenteric ischemia, PUD.  Plan was EGD this am.
   Hct increased appropriately after 1U PRBC yesterday.  Stable since,
   even increased this am, despite fluid resusciation.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   - PIV x 2
   - Transfuse for goal Hct of 30
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets to LN.  Will still plan on formal family meeting to
   discuss long term goals of care beyond line placement, most importantly
   in the short term, code status.
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care, including code status
   # Recurrent UTI: Patient s/p ureterostomy for bladder cancer in [**2166**]
   leading to frequent UTI's due to various pathogens, most frequently E.
   Coli, resistant to Cipro/Bactrim/Gent/Unasyn. A U/A on admission was
   positive for occasional bacteria & moderate leukocytes. A urine culture
   is pending. Given modest U/A, UTI is an unlikely source of infection on
   this admission.
   - F/U Ucx
   - Treat if positive
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.3. Unknown etiology of CKD, but may be [**1-4**] h/o bilateral
   hydronephrosis.  At his baseline.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Per OMR. Patient on no medications at home.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.
   - Clarify with family in the AM

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing diarrhea and presented with septic shock, which required aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors. He also had two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which were successfully treated with adenosine. The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, indicating a bacterial infection. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole to cover for possible Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. His imaging studies reveal pneumobilia with CBD stent, thickening of the duodenum, pancreatic nodules, distended rectum, large hypodense lesions in the liver, soft tissue densities in the mesentery adjacent to the duodenum, and a hydroureter. These findings suggest possible complications from malignancy, such as metastatic disease or intestinal obstruction.

The patient's current conditions include septic shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, malignancy of unknown primary, and recurrent urinary tract infection. The family has been informed about the patient's critical condition and the need for aggressive interventions. They"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, who presents to the ICU with symptoms of diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, and a positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for suspected septic shock. The patient also has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dementia, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's symptoms of hypotension, tachycardia, and positive blood culture indicate a potential septic shock. It is crucial to closely monitor his vital signs and provide appropriate fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of iron deficiency anemia and plans for an EGD suggest a possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding. Continuous monitoring of his hemoglobin levels and stool samples for occult blood is necessary.
3. Malignancy with Unknown Primary: The patient has a history of multiple malignancies, including bladder and colon cancer. The presence of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP and multiple liver lesions on CT scan raises concerns about metastatic disease. Further evaluation and staging are needed to determine the extent of malignancy and plan appropriate treatment.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent hospitalization, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, and his condition has been unstable with episodes of hypotension, tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient's family has made a care management order (CMO) and has agreed to treat his sepsis with fluids and antibiotics only, without the use of pressors or central access. Cultures have confirmed the presence of enterococcus, and the patient is currently receiving linezolid for suspected vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infection. He is also being treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to cover other potential enteric sources of infection. The patient's leukocytosis is worsening, and repeat blood cultures have been ordered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, tachycardia, and positive blood cultures indicates a severe infection leading to septic shock. This condition requires immediate medical attention and aggressive treatment to prevent further deterioration.
2. SVT: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of SVT, which can be a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's heart rhythm and continue treatment with adenosine while in"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only, and pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for enterococcus, sensitivities pending.
   Now on linezolid for suspected VRE, also on cipro/flagyl to cover
   other  enteric sources given presentation of diarrhea.  Consistently
   febrile, worsening leukocytosis.
   - IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro, flagyl
   - follow up blood cultures
   - repeat blood cultures
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: Likely infectious.  EGD was
   planned for yesterday but cancelled in light of hemodynamic
   instability.  Given family discussion, we will defer EGD for now.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fungating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), Hct stable over
   last 2 days.
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets .  Given extent of disease, prognosis poor.  Patient made
   CMO yesterday by family.

   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Low serum bicarbonate: Likely  non anion gap metabolic acidosis  from
   diarrhea.  Also possible lactic acidosis component given septic shock,
   though no AG.  AStable since admission.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.2, at baseline.  No change in management.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of diarrhea and initial admission for septic shock. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics and IV fluids. 

The patient experienced an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a heart rate of 170 beats per minute and low blood pressure. Adenosine was given, which helped return the heart rate to a sinus rhythm of 110 beats per minute and improved the blood pressure to 120 mmHg. The possibility of starting a beta-blocker for better rate control is being considered.

The patient's stool culture results are pending, and they have known allergies to vancomycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and linezolid. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F) and a current temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F). The heart rate has been fluctuating between 109 and 175 beats per minute, with a low blood pressure of 88/51 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 21 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   + Bcx, hypotension/tachycardia overnight and two episodes of SVT
   # Septic Shock
 One bcx culture yesterday positive for GPCs, started
   vanc.  Patient was progressively more tachycardic and hypotensive last
   night, requiring 4L of fluid yesterday, and eventually pressors.  First
   dopamine, which we d/c
ed [**1-4**] SVT, then norepinephrine.  We also
   started linezolid for VRE, and continued cipro/flagyl to cover GI gram
   negatives and anerobes.  Had lengthy discussion with family regarding
   goals, and whether we should place a CVL and a-line.  They are
   undecided.
   - repeat blood cultures
   - if family thinks it is consistent with his wishes, place CVL for
   pressor support
   - continue aggressive IV hydration
   - continue linezolid, cipro flagyl
   - stop vanc
   - follow up blood cultures
   - family meeting re: goals of care
   # Rectal pain/Leukocytosis/Diarrhea: No further episodes of diarrhea.
   Gastroenterology plans EGD today, will update them  regarding
   hemodynamic instability.  Stool cultures, c. diff toxin pending.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fugating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), but could be
   other cause including mesenteric ischemia, PUD.  Plan was EGD this am.
   Hct increased appropriately after 1U PRBC yesterday.  Stable since,
   even increased this am, despite fluid resusciation.
   - hold EGD
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   - PIV x 2
   - Transfuse for goal Hct of 30
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets to LN.  Will still plan on formal family meeting to
   discuss long term goals of care beyond line placement, most importantly
   in the short term, code status.
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care, including code status
   # Recurrent UTI: Patient s/p ureterostomy for bladder cancer in [**2166**]
   leading to frequent UTI's due to various pathogens, most frequently E.
   Coli, resistant to Cipro/Bactrim/Gent/Unasyn. A U/A on admission was
   positive for occasional bacteria & moderate leukocytes. A urine culture
   is pending. Given modest U/A, UTI is an unlikely source of infection on
   this admission.
   - F/U Ucx
   - Treat if positive
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.3. Unknown etiology of CKD, but may be [**1-4**] h/o bilateral
   hydronephrosis.  At his baseline.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Per OMR. Patient on no medications at home.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple malignancies, including recurrent colon cancer, recent hospitalization, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with diarrhea and was diagnosed with septic shock. The patient had positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci and was started on vancomycin. He required aggressive IV hydration, pressors, and antibiotics including linezolid for VRE, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The family is undecided about placing a central venous line and arterial line. The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. Stool cultures are pending, and the patient has been holding his own with appropriate Hct increase after PRBC transfusion. The plan includes repeating blood cultures, continuing aggressive IV hydration, and discussing goals of care.

Potential medical complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation and diagnosis indicate septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The presence of positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci suggests a bacterial infection. This increases the risk of further complications, such as sepsis or septicemia, if not treated effectively.
3. Hypotension and tachycardia: The patient's hypotension (low blood pressure) and tachycardia ("

The patient has been receiving antibiotics including vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, and metronidazole. They are currently being treated for SVT with adenosine and are in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 94/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 78 kg. The fluid balance shows an input of 3,090 mL, output of 1,395 mL, and a total balance of 1,695 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but not on any pressors. The physical examination is mostly not assessed except for the heart rhythm which is sinus tachycardia. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, along with increased levels of lactate and LDH. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, and there is no evidence of infection based on the microbiology report.

Potential medical complications:
1. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient has a blood culture positive for pansensitive enterococcus, indicating a potential enterococcal bacteremia. This can lead to sepsis and organ"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and
   recent outside hospitalization with diagnosis of metastatic disease,
   HTN, & CKD who presents to the [**Hospital1 54**] after 2 days of diarrhea, now with
   +enterococcus Bcx.  On admission, had episodes of
   hypotension/tachycardia and two episodes of SVT, now resolved.
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only; pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for pan sensitive enterococcus, ampicillin
   started yesterday afternoon and linezolid d/cd.  Continues on
   cipro/flagyl to cover other  possible enteric sources given
   presentation of diarrhea. Worsening leukocytosis, but afebrile
   overnight.  LFTs have trended down.
   - IV hydration.
   - continue ampicillin, cipro. Given that he is cdiff negative, if
   concern for anaerobes is low, could consider d/cing flagyl.
   - follow up blood cultures.
   - follow up final stool culture.
   # SVT
 Persistent episodes of SVT.  Given discussion with the family
   on [**2-9**], they would like us to continue to intervene with adenosine for
   SVT.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fungating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), Hct stable over
   last 2 days.  EGD deferred given goals of care.
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets .  Given extent of disease, prognosis poor.  Patient made
   CMO [**2-8**] by family.
   - CMO
   - pain control prn
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Low serum bicarbonate: Likely non anion gap metabolic acidosis  from
   diarrhea &/or IVF.  Also possible lactic acidosis component given
   septic shock, though no AG.  Stable since admission.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.4, at baseline.  No change in management.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.
   - Clarify with family in the AM
   #. Goals of care: DNR/DNI, treat with antibiotics, IVF, adenosine for
   SVT.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11784**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple
   malignancies including recurrent metastatic colon cancer,  HTN & CKD
   who presented with 2 days of diarrhea and admitted with hypotension and
   SVT. Found to have an enterococcus bacteremia; hypotension resolved
   with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics and adenosine tx for 2
   episodes of SVT.
   # Septic Shock
 Given discussion with family regarding goals of care,
   the decision was made to treat his sepsis with fluid and antibiotics
   only; pressors were stopped, and no central access was placed.
   Cultures from [**2-6**] positive for pan sensitive enterococcus, ampicillin
   started yesterday afternoon and linezolid d/cd.  Continues on
   cipro/flagyl to cover other  possible enteric sources given
   presentation of diarrhea. Worsening leukocytosis, but afebrile
   overnight.  LFTs have trended down.
   - IV hydration.
   - Per ID recs, ampicilin switched to Zosyn today, continue cipro. Given
   that he is cdiff negative and low concern for anaerobes will d/c
   flagyl.
   - follow up blood cultures.
   - follow up final stool culture.
   # SVT
 Persistent episodes of SVT.  Given discussion with the family
   on [**2-9**], they would like us to continue to intervene with adenosine for
   SVT.
   # GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Likely secondary to malignancy
   (specifically fungating mass seen on ERCP at St. E
s), Hct stable over
   last 2 days.  EGD deferred given goals of care.
   # Malignancy, of unknown primary: Patient with history of multiple
   malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with
   report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT
   torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial
   effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Path
   from St. E
s was adenocarcinoma, uncelar if this was a pancreatic mass,
   or colon mets .  Given extent of disease, prognosis poor.  Patient made
   DNR/DNI [**2-8**] by family.
   - pain control prn
   # HTN: All anti-hypertensives held.
   # Low serum bicarbonate: Likely non anion gap metabolic acidosis  from
   diarrhea &/or IVF.  Also possible lactic acidosis component given
   septic shock, though no AG.  Stable since admission.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, Cr on admission was 1.6,
   now 1.4, at baseline.  No change in management.
   # Dementia: At baseline, patient A&O x 1. Requires 24 hour assistance
   for all of his ADL's.
   # OSA: Per OMR. Unclear if patient's uses CPAP at home.
   - Clarify with family in the AM
   #. Goals of care: DNR/DNI, treat with antibiotics, IVF, adenosine for
   SVT.

","The patient is an 80-year-old man with multiple malignancies, including recurrent metastatic colon cancer, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with diarrhea and was admitted with hypotension and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). He was found to have an enterococcus bacteremia and his hypotension resolved with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.

The patient's goals of care include being DNR/DNI, treating with antibiotics, IV fluids, and using adenosine for SVT. His current medical conditions include septic shock, SVT, gastrointestinal bleed/iron deficiency anemia, malignancy of unknown primary, hypertension, low serum bicarbonate, chronic kidney disease, dementia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. The patient's blood cultures were positive for pan-sensitive enterococcus, and he is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, further episodes of SVT, gastrointestinal bleeding, progression of malignancy, exacerbation of hypertension, worsening kidney function, and respiratory complications due to obstructive sleep apnea."
