","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture requiring surgical intervention. The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis and urinary tract infection (UTI), presenting with fever, tachycardia, and mildly elevated lactate levels. The patient's recent urologic manipulation and positive urine analysis suggest urosepsis as the likely cause. Other possible complications to consider are wound infection due to recent surgery and pneumonia, although there is no cough to suggest it.

The patient has been receiving aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and has been weaned off norepinephrine. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin, which will be continued for now due to the patient's recent hospitalization and potential risk of MRSA.

Other medical issues noted include anemia, which is mildly microcytic and stable since the previous admission. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased today, likely due to massive volume resuscitation. Additionally, the patient has a history of a pelvic fracture with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and was previously anticoagulated. The patient will need outpatient follow-up for IVC filter removal.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular diet, maintaining good glycemic control, and has multiple"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture requiring surgical repair, now presenting with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis/UTI, as indicated by elevated white blood cell count, fever, tachycardia, and mildly elevated lactate levels. The most likely cause of the sepsis is urosepsis due to recent urologic manipulation, although wound infection is also considered given the recent surgery. The patient has been started on empiric coverage for GNR with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and received vancomycin in the emergency department. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 101 beats per minute (within normal range), blood pressure fluctuating between 91/58 mmHg and 90/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (within normal range), and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg.

The patient has received aggressive intravenous fluids (IVF) for CVP >12 and is being maintained with the use of norepinephrine as a pressor to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, weaning as tolerated. Blood cultures and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture. He presented with sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. His blood pressure declined despite receiving fluids, and a central venous line (CVL) was placed. The patient was initially tachycardic with a normal blood pressure but later developed hypotension. He received 8 liters of fluid initially but was weaned off of levophed quickly.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/UTI: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, fever, tachycardia, and mildly elevated lactate levels. This suggests a possible urinary tract infection leading to sepsis.
2. Anemia: The patient has mildly microcytic anemia that is stable from a previous admission. It is likely due to the massive volume resuscitation.
3. s/p Pelvic fracture: The patient has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and was systemically anticoagulated prior to yesterday's procedure. The patient should restart coumadin and will need outpatient follow-up for IVC filter removal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient does not have cough or shortness of breath, which reduces the likelihood of pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture, now presenting with sepsis likely secondary to a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and ciprofloxacin for the UTI. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they remain hypotensive despite weaning off pressors. The patient has an IVC filter in place due to a previous pelvic fracture, and they were systemically anticoagulated prior to yesterday's procedure. The patient also has a trichomonas infection, which will be treated with metronidazole. The patient's anemia is mildly microcytic and stable, and they are being maintained on iron therapy. The patient's blood sugar levels are well-controlled. The patient has multiple lines in place, including an 18-gauge and multi-lumen catheter. Prophylactic measures such as DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis are being administered. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU with a code status of full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current presentation of hypotension and fever suggests ongoing sepsis, likely due to the Pseudomonas UTI. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.
2. Pseudomonas UTI: The presence of a high colony count of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the urine culture indicates a significant UTI. This infection needs to be appropriately treated to prevent further complications.
3. Abdominal Abscess or Seroma: The patient's CT scan shows a possible abdominal abscess or seroma, which may be contributing to their ongoing fevers. If left untreated, this could lead to worsening sepsis and potentially require surgical intervention.
4. Anemia: The patient's mild microcytic anemia requires ongoing monitoring, especially in the setting of massive volume resuscitation. Transfusion may be necessary to maintain an adequate hematocrit level.
5. IVC Filter Complications: The patient has an IVC filter in place for DVT prophylaxis. While this is a common procedure, it does carry potential risks such as filter migration, embolization, or recurrent DVT. Close follow-up and consideration of filter removal may be required.
6. Trichomonas Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with a trichomonas infection, which will be treated with metronidazole. If not appropriately managed, this infection can cause persistent dysuria and discomfort.
7. Glycemic Control: Although the patient's blood sugar levels are currently well-controlled, careful monitoring is necessary to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.

Please note that the patient's condition should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of complex pelvic fracture, T12-L5 fracture, and ruptured bladder following a motor vehicle accident. He presents with fever and sepsis. The patient has been experiencing pressor requirement, urine growing pseudomonas, diffuse abdominal pain, and penile spasm. He has been receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and more. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/72 to 133/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/UTI: The patient has an elevated WBC count, fever, and tachycardia, which are indicative of an infection. Given the patient's recent urologic manipulation and positive urine analysis, it is likely that the source of infection is urinary. The patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage and further management will be based on culture data.

2. Anemia: The patient has mildly microcytic anemia, which has been stable since the previous admission. This may be due to massive volume resuscitation. The patient's hematoc"

","The patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of complex pelvic fracture, T12-L5 fracture, and ruptured bladder after a motor vehicle accident. He presents with fever and sepsis. The patient has been receiving pressor support intermittently and has diffuse abdominal pain. There is a seroma in the anterior abdominal wall, and the patient has a urinary tract infection indicated by the presence of Trichomonas in the urine analysis. The patient's EKG is normal, and he has no known drug allergies. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. His current medications include hydromorphone (Dilaudid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), celexa, protonix, zosyn, cipro, vanc, Hep 5K tid, lidoderm patch, and Percocet. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia. His central venous pressure is low. The patient has received a total of 6,921 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 5,010 mL. He has been receiving respiratory support with an SpO2 of 95%. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but his urine analysis shows the presence of pseudomonas. His lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and low potassium levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable. The patient's abdominal pain is present in the right lower quadrant. The patient's physical examination reveals that he is awake and interactive, with very pale skin, clear lungs bilaterally, soft bowel sounds, ostomy in place, and abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. The patient's extremities are warm and have palpable distal pulses. The patient's current assessment and plan include the continuation of empiric coverage for sepsis and urinary tract infection with piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin, following culture data. The patient will receive boluses for hypotension and maintain mean arterial pressure above 65 with the use of pressors. Surgery will be consulted regarding abdominal wall findings, discussing the possibility of an abscess or seroma on CT. The patient will start Flagyl for trichomoniasis. The patient's anemia will be managed with iron therapy. The patient's anticoagulation will be restarted, considering the placement of an inferior vena cava filter. Pain management will"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture. He is currently presenting with sepsis, likely secondary to a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has pneumonia, with a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. Additionally, he has chronic back pain, abdominal discomfort, and penile pain. 

The patient has been started on antibiotics (Zosyn) for the UTI and pneumonia, as well as vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is also receiving pain control with Dilaudid and Pyridium for dysuria. 

Other findings include anemia, which is mildly microcytic and stable from a previous admission. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased today due to massive volume resuscitation. 

Furthermore, the patient has a history of pelvic fracture and has undergone an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. He was previously on systemic anticoagulation and is now restarting Coumadin. The patient will need outpatient follow-up for IVC filter removal. 

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, progression of pneumonia, abdominal abscess or seroma, chronic back pain, anemia, and DVT."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture, now presenting with sepsis. He has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pseudomonas, which is sensitive to zosyn but resistant to ciprofloxacin. There is also a possible abdominal abscess or seroma on the CT scan. The patient is hypoxic with a new right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, indicating possible pneumonia. He is experiencing pain in the back, abdomen, and penis. Trichomonas was found in his urine analysis, and he has mild microcytic anemia. The patient has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and was previously on systemic anticoagulation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already presenting with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. UTI: The patient has a UTI caused by pseudomonas, which can lead to further complications if not properly treated.
3. Abdominal Abscess/Seroma: The CT scan shows a possible abdominal abscess or seroma, which may require drainage to prevent further complications.
4. Pneumonia: The new RLL infiltrate suggests possible pneumonia, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic back pain, abdominal discomfort, and penile pain should be managed appropriately to prevent complications associated with inadequate pain control.
6. Trichomonas Infection: The presence of trichomonas in the urine analysis should be addressed to prevent any potential complications related to this sexually transmitted infection.
7. Anemia: The patient's mild microcytic anemia should be monitored and managed to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
8. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient has an IVC filter for DVT prophylaxis and was previously on systemic anticoagulation. Care must be taken to manage his anticoagulation status appropriately to prevent both bleeding and thrombotic complications."

   46M with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture
   requiring SPT, now presenting with sepsis.
   #  Sepsis/UTI.  Likely secondary to Pseudomonas UTI. Also with
   ?abdominal abscess versus seroma on CT scan
   - Continue Zosyn
   - Urology and gen surgery recommendations appreciated. Currently no
   plan to drain fluid collection, but would revisit if fevers persist.
   # Pneumonia.  Noted to be hypoxic ([**5-20**]) with possible RLL pneumonia.
   - Given this would like be HAP, continue with vancomycin
   # Pain control.  Has chronic back pain bothering him in bed, but also
   abdominal discomfort and penile pain.
   - Continue dilaudid
   - Continue pyridium for dysuria.
   # Trichomonas.  Found to have trichomonas on UA
   - Got metronidazole 2000mg x1.
   # Anemia:  Mildly microcytic and stable from [**Month (only) 230**] admission.  On iron
   as outpatient.
   - Hct down today in the setting of massive volume resuscitation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse hct >25
   #  s/p Pelvic fracture: Has IVC filter for DVT prophylaxis and was
   systemically anticoagulated prior to yesterday's procedure (also for
   prophylaxis).
   - Restart coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture requiring surgery, now presenting with sepsis.
- The patient's urine culture showed pseudomonas, which is sensitive to zosyn but resistant to cipro. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued, and the patient is currently being treated with zosyn.
- The patient developed hypoxia and a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia. Vancomycin has been continued for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.
- The patient continues to experience pain, including chronic back pain, abdominal discomfort, and penile pain. Pain control is being managed with dilaudid.
- The patient was found to have trichomonas on urinalysis and received a single dose of metronidazole.
- The patient has mildly microcytic anemia that is stable from a previous admission. With massive volume resuscitation, the hematocrit level decreased, and it is planned to maintain active transfusion support with a target hematocrit of >25.
- The patient has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and was systemically anticoagulated prior to yesterday's procedure. Coumadin has been restarted, and outpatient follow-up for IVC filter removal is needed.
- The patient is receiving regular diet, blood sugar is well-controlled"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture, presenting with sepsis. He has been treated with antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. The patient's urine culture showed pseudomonas, which is sensitive to Zosyn but resistant to ciprofloxacin. He is currently on dilaudid IV for pain control and will be switched to MSIR as needed. The patient also has trichomonas infection, for which he will be treated with metronidazole. He has a history of anemia, which is mildly microcytic and stable since the previous admission. The patient underwent pelvic fracture and has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. His vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination shows decreased breath sounds at the right lower lung field, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness with some rebound but no guarding, and warm extremities with palpable distal pulses. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis. They have been experiencing hypoxia and a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient has been switched to Dilaudid IV for pain control. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on 05/20/2101 at 10:33 AM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/21/2101 at 12:00 AM, and vancomycin on 05/21/2101 at 01:17 AM.

Infusions include Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) since 05/21/2101 at 05:14 AM. Other medications and ICU care details are provided in the flow sheet data.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of sepsis, and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's initial presentation with sepsis and the development of pneumonia indicate a potential progression to sepsis with organ dysfunction if not appropriately managed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated serum creatinine levels (0.8-1.1 mg/dL)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of recent trauma and resulting bladder rupture requiring surgical repair. He is currently presenting with sepsis, likely secondary to a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has possible right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia and abdominal discomfort. He has been started on Zosyn, vancomycin, and dilaudid for pain control. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 15.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, glucose of 111 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 1.3 mmol/L. The urine culture shows pseudomonas sensitivity to Zosyn but resistance to ciprofloxacin. Blood cultures are negative for growth.

The patient has a history of pelvic fracture and has undergone an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. He was also systemically anticoagulated prior to yesterday's procedure. Due to the possibility of abdominal surgery"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of pseudomonal urinary tract infection and sepsis after a suprapubic catheter change. The patient has shown improvement, with resolution of nausea and treatment for trichomoniasis. The patient is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HA-PNA) and acute pain. The patient's sepsis has resolved, but he still requires a 10-day course of antibiotics. The patient also has ongoing pain related to the pelvic/penis area, for which he is receiving Dilaudid. Additionally, the patient needs treatment for trichomoniasis. The patient has an IVC filter and a pelvic FX due to a potential surgery procedure, and he is holding Coumadin. His central line is being changed to peripheral lines and will be discontinued. The patient's nutritional needs are being met, and his blood sugar is well controlled. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with subcutaneous low-dose heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the floor soon."
