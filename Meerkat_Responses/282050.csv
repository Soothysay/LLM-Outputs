","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with flu-like symptoms, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and possible lung infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to increased work of breathing and worsening lung exam. She has been intubated and sedated. Her vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and shallow respirations. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on 100% FiO2. She is receiving supportive care, including Tamiflu for H1N1 influenza, IV fluids, and droplet precautions. There are concerns about hypoxia, which could be due to influenza or a superimposed bacterial process. The patient is also being treated for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and depression. The patient has been placed on full code status and is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates a potential risk for inadequate oxygen supply to vital organs.
2. Influenza complications: H1N1 influenza can lead to severe respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Bacterial superinfection: The presence of a possible lung infiltrate and"

   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
   63F who presented to OSH ED with flu like symptoms, fever, and SOB. Her
   symptoms began Friday [**11-16**] with body aches and a cough. She also
   reports an H1N1 outbreak in her area. She then developed fever to 102
   and chills last night, and today developed wheezing. Cough was dry,
   non-productive, thinkns there might have been some blood in it today.
   Symptoms associated with generalized fatigue and weakness and
   lightheadedness especially on standing. She had nausea but no vomiting,
   and did have diarrhea x 3 today. She presented to an OSH ED, where she
   was noted to be hypoxic to 85% ra, and hypotensive to 80s. CXR showed
   bilat infiltrates. CBC with 49%bands and wbc 5.2. Received 2l ivf, CTX,
   azithro, and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**].
   .
   In the emergency department, triage VS were: t=unable, 117 90/50, 38,
   95%. Pressure dropped to 70s. Was mentating fine, satting well on NRB.
   A RIJ was placed and levophed was started. Vancomycin, zosyn, and
   tamiflu were added to previously given abx regimen. Lactate returned at
   4.4. 1.5 liters of IVF were given with lactate improved to 3.2. CXR
   revealed retrocardiac consolidation which may represent pneumonia or
   atelectasis. Intubation was considered but pt appeared well enough on
   NRB that this was not performed. Most recent VS: 101/59 101 27 97% NRB.
   Levophed at 0.04.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with flu-like symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. The symptoms began with body aches and cough, and the patient reported an H1N1 outbreak in her area. She developed a high fever last night and today experienced wheezing, dry cough, and possible blood in her cough. The patient also reported generalized fatigue, weakness, lightheadedness, nausea, and diarrhea.

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient was noted to be hypoxic and hypotensive. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates, and laboratory tests showed a high white blood cell count with bands. The patient was started on IV fluids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and transferred to another hospital.

In the emergency department, the patient's vital signs were unstable, with dropping blood pressure and a low oxygen saturation level. She was given IV fluids and medications including vancomycin, zosyn, and tamiflu. The patient's lactate level improved after receiving IV fluids, and a repeat chest X-ray showed retrocardiac consolidation, which may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.

The patient was tested for H1N1 influenza and the results came back positive. She was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza, possible pneumonia, and other complications such as hypotension, hypoxia,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of flu-like symptoms. She was found to have H1N1 influenza and possible lung infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's current condition indicates hypotension, likely due to volume depletion, but there is concern for shock with septic physiology as evidenced by a lactate level of 4.4. The patient is also experiencing hypoxia, which could be caused by the influenza infection, but there is concern for a possible superimposed bacterial process based on the chest X-ray findings.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O. Her blood pressure is 126/64 mmHg, heart rate is 113 beats per minute, oxygen saturation is 99%, and temperature is 36.3°C.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 249 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) at 12.2 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level at 196 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level at 3.2 mmol/L. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of influenza (H1N1) who presented with significant respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to progressive respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia, possibly evolving ARDS, and superimposed left lower lobe pneumonia. 

The patient also experienced hypotension due to hypovolemia and sepsis but has now resolved and is off vasopressors. Fluid management is being closely monitored to maintain adequate volume status with a target central venous pressure (CVP) of more than 8 cm H2O. Renal function is preserved, and neurological status is being monitored with continued sedation and daily wake-up trials.

Nutritional support has been initiated through total parenteral nutrition (TF). The patient is receiving prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with boots and systemic anticoagulation, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention strategies including head of bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up trials, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) monitoring.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires ongoing close monitoring and management in the intensive care unit (ICU)."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yof now with respiratory failure in setting of influenza (likely
   H1N1) and possible bacterial LLL pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to to progressive pneumonia
   (influenza), possible evolving ARDS, perhaps superimposed LLL
   pneumonia.  Continue mechanical ventilation (lung protective strategy),
   monitor ABG, SaO2, CXR, and clinical response.   Would proceed with
   a-line.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to influenza, bacterial pneumonia
   (LLL), and possible evolving ARDS.  Continue Tamiflu and empirical
   antimicrobials (Vanco, Ceftrixone, Levofloxicin)
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Resolved.  Now
   off vasopressors.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, now improved.  Monitor I/O, maintain CVP >8 cm
   H2O.  Will require exchange of central line (resite)
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor I/O, urine output.
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- continue sedation.  Daily wake up.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with respiratory failure due to influenza and possible bacterial lower left lobe (LLL) pneumonia. He was intubated this morning for progressive respiratory distress. His vitals show a sinus tachycardia, hypotension that has resolved, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a lung protective strategy. Imaging shows progressive diffuse alveolar infiltrates, bilaterally, with retrocardiac density.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial complaint and ongoing issue is respiratory failure. This is attributed to influenza and possible evolving Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), as well as bacterial LLL pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG), oxygen saturation (SaO2), chest X-ray (CXR), and clinical response is necessary. The patient will continue with mechanical ventilation and may require additional interventions such as tracheostomy.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates due to influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and possible evolving ARDS. The treatment plan includes continuing antiviral therapy with Tamiflu and empirical antimicrobials (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin).
3. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis. It has now resolved, and the patient is off vas"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a confirmed diagnosis of H1N1 influenza and possible bacterial superinfection. She presented with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is tachycardic. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, indicating possible infection and tissue hypoperfusion.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She is currently receiving multiple medications including Tamiflu, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and various antibiotics for suspected bacterial superinfection. The patient's nutritional support is being provided through tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has confirmed H1N1 influenza with possible bacterial superinfection. This increases the risk of pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics have been started to cover both viral and bacterial causes.

2. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, but it has resolved. Close monitoring of blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) is essential to detect any recurrence of hypotension. If hypotension occurs, IV fluid resuscitation and goal-directed therapy will be implemented.

3. Hypoxia: The patient continues to have hypoxia, likely due to confirmed influenza. There is concern for a super"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a confirmed diagnosis of H1N1 influenza and possible pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 109/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on FiO2 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.27, PaCO2 of 46, PaO2 of 164, HCO3- of 22, and base excess of -5. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 16.1 K/uL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) is also elevated at 26 mg/dL.

The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing and continued hypoxia, likely secondary to the flu and possible superimposed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). There is also concern for anion gap acidosis, which is likely due to elevated lactate levels. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), and oral metformin has been held due to lactic acidosis.

The patient has received various treatments, including Tamiflu for H1N1 influenza, IV fluids for resuscitation, and antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O.

Overall, the patient's main medical complications include respiratory failure, possible superimposed CAP, anion gap acidosis, and diabetes mellitus. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values is necessary to guide further management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a confirmed diagnosis of H1N1 influenza and possible CAP (community-acquired pneumonia). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 109/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on the ventilator.

The patient has received various interventions, including arterial line placement, bolus infusions of normal saline, left internal jugular vein catheterization, and placement of a nasogastric tube. She has also been started on tube feeds at 20 cc/hr and is being treated for suspected bacterial superinfection with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and increased lactate levels. Her coagulation profile indicates a prolonged PT/INR and PTT, with a fibrinogen level of 669 mg/dL. Other lab values, including glucose and electrolytes, are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have increased work of breathing and hypoxia likely secondary to flu and possible superimposed CAP. She will be continued on mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, found to have H1N1
   influenza and possible infiltrate on CXR
   # Respiratory Failure
 due to increased work of breathing and
   continued hypoxia likely secondary to flu and possible superimposed CAP
   -- RISB 119 this AM
 no extubation
 may try SBT to see how well the
   patient will tolerate it
   -- Will wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -- Check ABG after FiO2 weaned
   #. H1N1 Influenza
 confirmed by DFA at OSH
   -- Continue Tamiflu 150mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -- supportive care with tylenol prn fever, IVF
   # Hypoxia/CAP - Likely etiology is confirmed influenza, yet there is
   concern for a superimposed bacterial infection given the X-ray findings
   and increased lactate.
   -- treat flu as above
   -- F/u sputum, blood cultures
   -- Ventilated
   -- treat as ICU level CAP with vancomycin 1250mg [**Hospital1 7**], ceftriaxone and
   levofloxacin
   .
   #. Hypotension/perfusion - resolved.  BP currently stable off of
   pressors.  Lactate is trending down with the last value at 2.7 from
   ABG.  UOP was poor yesterday and she received a total of 2500 ml in
   boluses and has not required pressors
   -- IVf resuscitation
 if hypotensive/CVP drops
   -- Measure CVP, with a goal of  [**8-29**]
 bolus if necessary
   -- Goal MAP 65
   -- trend lactate
   # Coagulopathy
   -- Follow-up labs
   -- Monitor after TF are started
   -- Monitor for signs and symptoms of a bleed
   .
   #. Anion Gap Acidosis
 Gap of 15 today, likely due to elevated lactate
   -- Continue to trend
   .
   #. DM
   -- Hold oral metformin because of lactic acidosis
   -- FSG qid, DM diet, HISS
   .
   #. HL
   -- Continue lipitor
   .
   # Depression
   -- prozac for now (amytriptyline is a home med)

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was found to have H1N1 influenza and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient has respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing and continued hypoxia likely secondary to flu and possible superimposed CAP. Her RISB is 119, indicating a need for continued ventilatory support. The patient also has confirmed H1N1 influenza and there is concern for a superimposed bacterial infection given the X-ray findings and increased lactate. She is being treated with Tamiflu, supportive care with tylenol as needed, and IV fluids. Additionally, she is receiving ICU level CAP treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. The patient's hypotension/perfusion has resolved, with stable blood pressure off of pressors. Her lactate is trending down. She received a total of 2500 ml in boluses and has not required pressors. The patient has a coagulopathy and anion gap acidosis, which will be monitored. She has a history of diabetes mellitus and depression, for which she is receiving appropriate medication. The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition and has multiple lines in place for medical management."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yof now with respiratory failure in setting of influenza (likely
   H1N1) and possible bacterial LLL pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to to progressive pneumonia
   (influenza), possible evolving ARDS, perhaps superimposed LLL
   pneumonia.  Continue mechanical ventilation (lung protective strategy),
   monitor ABG, SaO2, CXR, and clinical response.   Monitor ABG.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to influenza, bacterial pneumonia
   (LLL), and possible evolving ARDS.  Continue Tamiflu and empirical
   antimicrobials (Vanco, Ceftrixone, Levofloxicin).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Resolved.  Now
   off vasopressors.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, now improved.  Monitor I/O, maintain CVP >8 cm
   H2O.  Central line resited.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor I/O, urine output.
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- continue sedation.  Daily wake up.
   DIABETES MELLITUS
 monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   COAGULOPATHY
 possibly related to medications and poor PO intake.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

The patient is a 63-year-old male with respiratory failure due to influenza (likely H1N1) and possible bacterial lower left lobe pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. Central line was replaced yesterday, and the patient is off vasopressors. The patient's vital signs show a fever, low blood pressure, and an increased heart rate. The respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 96%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2 of 164, and HCO3- of 21 mEq/L. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart rhythm, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and right lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt, elevated glucose level, and abnormal coagulation profile. The assessment and plan include continued mechanical ventilation, monitoring ABG, CXR, and clinical response, continuation of Tamiflu and empirical antimicrobials, monitoring of blood pressure, fluid balance, renal function, neurological status, diabetes mellitus, and nutritional support.

   pneumonia.  Continue mechanical ventilation (lung protective strategy),
   monitor ABG, SaO2, CXR, and clinical response.   Monitor ABG.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to influenza, bacterial pneumonia
   (LLL), and possible evolving ARDS.  Continue Tamiflu and empirical
   antimicrobials (Vanco, Ceftrixone, Levofloxicin).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Resolved.  Now
   off vasopressors.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, now improved.  Monitor I/O, maintain CVP >8 cm
   H2O.  Central line resited.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor I/O, urine output.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old individual with respiratory failure due to influenza (likely H1N1) and possible bacterial lower left lobe (LLL) pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to progressive pneumonia (influenza), possible evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and superimposed LLL pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG), oxygen saturation (SaO2), chest X-ray (CXR), and clinical response is recommended.

2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates attributed to influenza, bacterial pneumonia (LLL), and possible evolving ARDS. Continuing antiviral medication (Tamiflu) and empirical antimicrobials (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin) is advised.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis. However, it has resolved, and the patient is now off vasopressors. Close monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is crucial.

4. Fluid Balance: The patient initially had hypovolemia but is now improved. Close monitoring of input/output (I/O) and maintaining central venous pressure (CVP) above"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with respiratory failure due to influenza and possible bacterial lower left lobe (LLL) pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. Central line replaced yesterday. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/53 mmHg to 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 164, and a respiratory system compliance of 28.6 cmH2O/mL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: Attributed to progressive pneumonia (influenza), possible evolving Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and superimposed LLL pneumonia. Continue mechanical ventilation with a lung-protective strategy, monitor arterial blood gas (ABG), oxygen saturation (SaO2), chest X-ray (CXR), and clinical response.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: Attributed to influenza, bacterial pneumonia (LLL), and possible evolving ARDS. Continue Tamiflu and empirical antimicrobials (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was found to have H1N1 influenza and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 76/47 mmHg to 84/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F).

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 39 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 71 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 91%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count (WBC) of 4.6-9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.1 g/dL, sodium (Na+) of 133 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 27.7 %, glucose of 89-133 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 1.6 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing and continued hypoxia likely secondary to flu and possible superimposed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's H1N1 influenza is confirmed by DFA at OSH, and she is being treated with Tamiflu. The patient's hypoxia/CAP is likely etiology is confirmed influenza, yet there is concern for a superimposed bacterial infection given the X-ray findings and increased lactate.

The patient's hypotension/perfusion has resolved, with stable blood pressure off of pressors and decreasing lactate levels. The patient's coagulopathy is being monitored with follow-up labs and observation for signs and symptoms of bleeding. The patient's anion gap acidosis is being trended, and her diabetes mellitus (DM) is being managed with held oral metformin and HISS.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing and continued hypoxia, superimposed bacterial infection on top of H1N1 influenza leading to worsening pneumonia, and complications related to the patient's DM."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with confirmed H1N1 influenza and possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. The respiratory support settings show a mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and spontaneous RR of 0.

The physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds, diffuse rhonchi, and decreased breath sounds at the bases, with the right side being worse than the left. The patient's neurologic status is not assessed in the note. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 236 K/uL.

   pneumonia.  Continue mechanical ventilation (lung protective strategy),
   monitor ABG, SaO2, CXR, and clinical response.   Monitor ABG.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Persistent, perhaps progressive.  Attributed
   to influenza, bacterial pneumonia (LLL), and possible evolving ARDS.
   Continue Tamiflu and empirical antimicrobials (Vanco, Ceftrixone,
   Levofloxicin).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Resolved.  Now
   off vasopressors.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, now improved.  Monitor I/O, maintain CVP >8 cm
   H2O.  Central line resighted.
   ANEMIA -- evolving since admission, suspect related to blood loss and
   phlebotomy.  Doubt DIC or hemolysis.  Monitor stool guiac.  Type &
   screen for possible transfusion.  Monitor Hct, transfuse if Hct <25
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor I/O, urine output.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old individual who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is attributed to progressive pneumonia, likely caused by influenza (possibly H1N1) and possible bacterial pneumonia in the lower left lobe (LLL). The patient has been mechanically ventilated and is receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin) as well as Tamiflu. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and they are no longer on vasopressors. Fluid balance, renal function, and nutritional support are being monitored. The patient's anemia is believed to be related to blood loss and phlebotomy, and they will be monitored for possible transfusion. The patient's neurological status is being assessed daily, and they are sedated. There are concerns about coagulopathy and diabetes mellitus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to evolving ARDS and superimposed LLL pneumonia.
2. Possible complications from mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
3. Hypotension and sepsis leading to organ dysfunction.
4. Anemia due to blood loss and phlebotomy.
5. Coagulopathy possibly related to medications and poor PO intake.
6. Diabetes mellitus requiring monitoring and management.
7. Nutritional support may be necessary due to the patient's critical condition and inability to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old individual with respiratory failure, likely due to influenza and possible bacterial lower left lobe pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated with unfavorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have a history of hypotension, which has resolved. There are concerns about anemia, renal function, neurological status, diabetes mellitus, and coagulopathy. The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding and has multiple lines inserted for medication administration. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary infiltrates suggest the possibility of developing ARDS. ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of developing VAP. This is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility, critical illness, and presence of central lines increase the risk of developing blood clots. DVT can lead to"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She will need PEEP/ sedation and FiO2 adjusted today. She is at risk
   for developing severe ARDS. We will proceed to CTA of chest to r/o
   possibility of PE given tachycardia and increasing O2 needs. Broad
   antibiotics to continue for now. BAL only to be performed if there are
   worsening signs of hypoxemia.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of H1N1 influenza and possible CAP (community-acquired pneumonia). She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Her vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and elevated Cr levels. The assessment and plan include treatment for H1N1 influenza, suspected bacterial infection, and respiratory failure. The patient also has decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit of unknown etiology and a coagulopathy with mildly elevated PT and PTT levels. Other medical conditions mentioned include diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and depression. The patient is receiving supportive care with IV fluids, antibiotics, and antiviral medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to the worsening lung condition and increased oxygen needs.
2. Superimposed bacterial infection on top of the H1N1 influenza, which can lead to secondary pneumonia.
3. Decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit of unknown etiology, requiring further investigation.
4. Coagulopathy with mildly elevated PT and PTT levels, indicating a risk of bleeding.
5. Potential pulmonary embolism (PE) given the tachycardia and increasing oxygen needs, which will be ruled out by a CTA (computed tomography angi"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a confirmed diagnosis of H1N1 influenza and possible superimposed CAP (community-acquired pneumonia). She is currently intubated in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypoxia, and fever. Her laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's current respiratory failure and intubation, there is a risk of developing further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), or barotrauma.

2. Influenza Progression: Although the patient has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza, there is still a possibility of worsening symptoms and progression of the viral infection, leading to additional respiratory distress or secondary bacterial infections.

3. Septic Shock: The patient's elevated lactate levels and previous hypotension suggest a possible septic shock state. Close monitoring and prompt management are essential to prevent further deterioration.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT and PTT indicate a coagulation disorder. It is crucial to monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding and follow-up with labs to ensure normalization of coagulation parameters.

5. Metabolic Disturbances: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was found to have H1N1 influenza and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS requires careful management of ventilator settings according to ARDSnet guidelines, placement of an esophageal balloon for optimization of Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP), and continuous monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs) via arterial line.
2. Pneumonia: The patient likely has bacterial superinfection in addition to H1N1 influenza pneumonia. Antibiotics should be continued, including cefepime for enhanced Pseudomonas coverage, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. Tamiflu should be continued, and cultures should be followed up.
3. Anemia: The cause of anemia is unknown, but it should be monitored closely. A peripheral blood smear (crit) can be checked to trend, and an active transfusion service should be consulted for possible transfusion.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has non-oliguric renal failure, likely due to contrast nephropathy. Creatinine levels should be trended, nephro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and possible CAP (community-acquired pneumonia). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs show tachycardia and hypoxemia. She has an increased work of breathing and continued hypoxia likely secondary to flu and possible superimposed CAP. Her ABG results indicate respiratory failure. The patient has confirmed H1N1 influenza and there is concern for a superimposed bacterial infection given the X-ray findings and increased lactate. She is being treated with antiviral medication, antibiotics, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increased work of breathing and continued hypoxia suggest respiratory failure. The ABG results indicate respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing and continued hypoxia likely secondary to flu and possible superimposed CAP.

2. Superimposed Bacterial Infection: The X-ray findings and increased lactate raise concern for a superimposed bacterial infection. The patient is being treated with antibiotics to cover this possibility.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has mildly elevated PT and PTT, but normalizing INR. She will need follow-up labs and monitoring after transfusions are started to monitor for signs and symptoms of a bleed.

4. Hypotension/Perfusion"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and possible pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which meets criteria for ARDS. 

The patient has been experiencing fevers and increasing leukocytosis, indicating a possible bacterial superinfection or primary influenza pneumonia. The concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also present, and cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism.

The patient has anemia of unknown etiology, acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy, and diabetes mellitus. She is also being treated for depression.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.1°F (39.5°C), heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/64 mmHg to 130/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 2.1 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics ("

   [**Hospital3 6630**] microbiology laboratory and I was not able to get from
   them a confirmation that a nasal swab had been sent at that hospital
   for influenza so it is not clear that H1N1 was confirmed.  Our study
   was suboptimal and is being repeated.  Also let them know that an ID
   consult was obtained and they will be seeing the patient later today.
   The family is aware that the patient is critically ill and requiring

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with H1N1 influenza and a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of fatty liver and has had a cholecystectomy (CCY) in the past. She is unable to provide her own history as she is sedated and intubated. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.1°F (39.5°C), heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/66 mmHg to 119/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21,000 cells/microliter, elevated creatinine levels, and altered liver function tests. The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure secondary to IV contrast dye, diabetes mellitus type II, depression, anemia, and an alteration in nutrition.

The plan includes continuing treatment for ARDS, which is secondary to H1N1 pneumonia and a probable superimposed bacterial infection. The patient's high fevers, increased white blood cell count, and concern for complicated parap"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was found to have H1N1 influenza and possible infiltrate on CXR. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with no response to commands. She is also experiencing tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops, coarse breath sounds, diffuse rhonchi, decreased breath sounds at the bases, right worse than left, and an obese abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds. There is no edema or calf pain, but dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are present. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 21.0 to 24.2 thousand cells/microliter, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels indicating acute renal failure, and abnormal liver function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis reveals respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.29, high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (TCO2) levels, and low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) levels.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure meeting criteria for ARDS, possible pneumonia including H1N1 influenza with superimposed bacterial pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy, anemia of unknown etiology, and depression.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to her symptoms and test results. She will continue ventilation per ARDSnet protocol and FiO2 to 50%, weaning as tolerated. Serial ABGs will be followed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has increasing leukocytosis and fevers, which raises concerns for possible H1N1 influenza, bacterial superinfection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), or line infection. Tamiflu will be continued, pending cultures, and cefepime for pseudomonal coverage will be reanalyzed dosed due to acute renal failure (ARF) and low clearance. Vancomycin will be continued as renal dosing, and levels will be monitored for dosing.

3. Anemia: The patient has unknown etiology anemia, and it will be closely monitored. A complete blood count (CBC) will be checked, and a transfusion will be considered if necessary.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is non-oliguric"

   following.  Ventilated, sedated and appears comfortable.  No secretions
   reported per ETT.  Lungs with decreased BS dependently, scattered
   crackles anterolaterally.  Abdomen soft, distended, rare BS.  Cr stable
   at 1.7.  WBC slightly decreased.  Hct slightly down but also almost 2 L

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was found to have H1N1 influenza and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is being ventilated per ARDSnet protocol. She is also receiving esophageal balloon optimization of PEEP and FiO2 at 50%, to be weaned as tolerated.

The patient has increasing leukocytosis and fevers, questioning H1N1 influenza with possible bacterial superinfection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other possible etiologies include bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and line infection. She is being treated with Tamiflu, cefepime for pseudomonal coverage, and vancomycin.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely due to contrast nephropathy, with stable creatinine levels. She will continue to trend closely, avoid nephrotoxins, and have medications dosed accordingly.

The patient also has anemia of unknown etiology, being monitored closely with plans for further investigation and treatment as needed. Active T+S (transfusion support) is also mentioned.

Other medical conditions present include diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HL), and depression, all of which require ongoing outpatient management.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics for the suspected bacterial infection. The pneumonia is questionable H1N1 influenza, which was confirmed by DFA at the OSH. The patient is also showing signs of anemia, acute renal failure, and depression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function, and progression of anemia. The patient's condition will need to be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was admitted to the hospital with suspected H1N1 influenza and possible pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 39.5 C (103.1 F)
- Heart rate: 88 bpm
- Blood pressure: 122/60 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on ventilator

The patient is intubated and sedated, with no response to commands. She has a cooling blanket on and tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is obese with hypoactive bowel sounds. She has 2+ pitting edema in her upper extremities bilaterally and dorsalis pedis/posterior tibial pulses. Her skin is without rashes, lesions, or ecchymoses.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), lactate, liver enzymes (AST/ALT), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood cultures were drawn overnight.

The patient meets criteria for ARDS and is currently"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. The patient is suspected to have H1N1 influenza from the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. 

The patient meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection. The current ventilator settings are 470/24/20/50%. It is recommended to continue esophageal balloon to optimize PEEP, decrease FiO2 to 40%, and follow-up with an ABG.

The patient also has increasing leukocytosis and fevers, which may indicate pneumonia or bacteremia. The flu test was initially positive but later found to be negative, so Tamiflu will be continued until the patient is afebrile for 48 hours. Cefepime will be continued for pseudomonal coverage due to acute renal failure (ARF). Vancomycin will also be continued as renal dosing.

The patient has anemia of unknown etiology, and further investigation is needed. Active T+S and haptoglobin levels should be checked, along with monitoring for any obvious source of bleeding. If the patient continues to trend down, a pan scan may be considered.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to contrast nephropathy. Renal dosing of medications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia (likely due to influenza A/H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection), acute renal failure (possibly due to contrast nephropathy), and anemia of unknown etiology. The patient is also being treated for diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and pneumonia put her at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly. There is also a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy due to the use of contrast agents during medical imaging.
3. Infectious Complications: The patient has an increased risk of developing secondary infections due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia increase her risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's anemia of unknown etiology requires further investigation, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant therapy.

","Based on the provided physician's progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation. It is important to continue following the ARDSnet ventilation guidelines and monitoring the patient's response to the treatment.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has increasing leukocytosis and fevers, which are concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other possible etiologies include urinary tract infection (UTI) and line infection. Cultures should be followed, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued based on the results.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia of unknown etiology, with negative hemolysis labs. Further investigations such as guaiac stool, active T+S, and HCT transfusion should be considered to determine the cause of anemia.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has non-oliguric acute renal failure, likely due to contrast nephropathy. Renal dosing of medications, avoidance of nephrotoxins, fluid balance management, and electrolyte repletion should be prioritized.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. The patient also has increasing leukocytosis and fevers, questioning H1N1 influenza. She is being treated with Tamiflu, cefepime, and vancomycin. The patient has anemia of unknown etiology, acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy, and diabetes mellitus. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 116/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and she is intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient meets criteria for ARDS and is likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. The patient will continue on ventilator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation, and esophageal balloon optimization of PEEP will be monitored.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has increasing leukocytosis and fevers, questioning H1N1 influenza. She is being treated with Tamiflu, cefepime, and vancomycin. Other possible etiologies include bacteremia"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She is intubated and sedated, with no response to commands. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She meets criteria for ARDS and is being ventilated with PRVC/AC mode, set at 470 mL tidal volume, 24 breaths per minute, 16 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient also has increasing leukocytosis and fevers, raising concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), or line infection. She was pancultured overnight and re-swabbed for flu, which came back negative. Tamiflu treatment will continue until she is afebrile for 48 hours.

The patient has anemia of unknown etiology, with a positive 14 liters blood loss over her stay and decreasing hematocrit (HCT). Active transfusion support is being provided, aiming for a target HCT of 24. If she continues to trend down, a pan scan may be considered.

She has acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to contrast nephropathy, with non-oliguric urine output"

   -- Maintain FiO2 at 40% and consider dropping PEEP 14 and f/u abg
   -- Continue to follow serial ABGs
   #. Pneumonia / increasing leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1
   Influenza confirmed by DFA at OSH. Patient likely has bacterial
   superinfection vs. primary influenza pneumonia now concerning for VAP.
   Other possible etiologies include bacteremia, UTI, and line infection.
   Pt was pancultured overnight.
   -- Re-swab for Flu found to be negative
 follow up with [**Hospital 2653**] hospital
   to determine if there was ever a positive DFA documented
   -- Continue Tamiflu 150mg [**Hospital1 **] until afebrile for 48 hours
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending)
   -- Continue cefepime (2g daily) for pseudomonal coverage renally dosed
   due to ARF and low clearance
   -- Continue vancomycin 1250 QD as renal dosing
 f/u levels for dosing
   -- Cipro 400 mg daily added for double coverage of Pseudomonas
   continue treatment
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   -- F/u ID recs on potential treatments
   #. Anemia
 unknown etiology
 will monitor closely
 positive 14
   liters over her stay
 HCT continuing to drop
   -- Check PM crit to continue to trend
   -- Active T+S
   -- Check haptoglobin in the setting of increasing LDH
 Bili is stable
   -- HCT transfusion goal of 24
 currently at 24.1 if she drops with the
   PM check transfuse 2 units
   -- If she continues to trend down, and has no obvious source of bleed,
   consider pan scan
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Non-oliguric. Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy
   now with potential pre-renal component with BUN/Creatinine ratio
   increasing.
   -- Check urine lytes and eos
   -- Check CVP
   -- Consider transfusion
 trend HCT and Cr
   -- trend Cr
   -- avoid nephrotoxins
   -- renally dose meds
   -- Fluid balance goal of even to 500ml positive
 if grossly positive,
   add a small dose of lasix to keep goal at even to 500 positive
   .
   #. DM
   -- Continue covering with SSI
   -- Add 5 units of Lantus daily for long acting coverage
   -- FSG qid, DM diet, HISS

   Agree w/ excellent MS IV note above
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient has several medical complications that require attention. Firstly, she has pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and a superimposed bacterial infection. She is being treated with antiviral medication (Tamiflu) for the suspected H1N1 influenza, and antibiotics (cefepime, ciprofloxacin) for the bacterial infection. 

Secondly, the patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to contrast nephropathy from a previous procedure. She is non-oliguric, meaning her urine output is low. Her BUN/Creatinine ratio is increasing, indicating a potential pre-renal component. Measures are being taken to monitor her renal function and manage her fluid balance.

Thirdly, the patient has anemia with an unknown etiology. Her hemoglobin level is low, and her hematocrit (HCT) is decreasing. Blood transfusion is being considered based on her HCT levels.

Lastly, the patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe lung condition that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. She is being ventilated and receiving appropriate ARDSnet"

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Persistently febrile. Line sites are without erythema or discharge.
   Cultures remain no growth to date.  WBC remains at 22.  Plan to repeat
   urine and blood culture, send sputum for GS C & S.  Send fungal
   isolators.  Stool sent for C. Diff.  Given persistent fever and
   leukocytosis will send for head/chest/abdominal CT with oral contrast.
   Particularly concerned for parapneumonic effusion that may need further
   evaluation - possible thorocentesis.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**]):

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH and possible infiltrate on CXR
   # Respiratory Failure
 Meets criteria for ARDS
 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 current settings 470/24/16/50% - PaO2 66
 goal of better than 65
   -- Maintain FiO2 at 50% and PEEP of 16 and f/u abg at 12 to determine
   where we are
   -- Continue to follow serial ABGs
   #. Pneumonia / increasing leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1
   Influenza confirmed by DFA at OSH. Patient likely has bacterial
   superinfection vs. primary influenza pneumonia now concerning for VAP.
   Other possible etiologies include bacteremia, UTI, and line infection.
   Pt was pancultured overnight.  CT negative for effusion or fluid
   collection in the belly yesterday
 Fevers are improving
   -- Re-swab for Flu found to be negative
s clinical judgment is
   that this is flu
   -- Continue Tamiflu 150mg [**Hospital1 **] until afebrile for 48 hours
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending)
   -- Continue cefepime (2g daily) for pseudomonal coverage renally dosed
   due to ARF and low clearance
   -- Continue vancomycin 1250 QD as renal dosing
 f/u levels for dosing
   -- Cipro 400 mg daily added for double coverage of Pseudomonas
   continue treatment
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   -- F/u ID recs on potential treatments
   #. Anemia
 unknown etiology
 will monitor closely
 positive 14
   liters over her stay
 HCT improved today
 No blood given due to
   fevers
   -- Check PM crit to continue to trend
   -- Active T+S
   -- HCT transfusion goal of 24
 currently at 26.2
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Non-oliguric. Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy
   now with potential pre-renal component with BUN/Creatinine ratio
   increasing.
   -- Check urine lytes and eos
   -- Check CVP
   -- Consider transfusion for intravascular repletion and perfusion if
   she is afebrile
 trend HCT and Cr
   -- trend Cr
   -- avoid nephrotoxins
   -- renally dose meds
   -- Fluid balance goal of even to 500ml positive
 continue lasix drip
   .
   #. DM
   -- Continue covering with SSI and glargine 5
   -- FSG qid, DM diet, HISS
   .
   #. HL
   -- Hold lipitor in the setting of increasing LFTs

   Disposition: ICU
   Agree with excellent MS note above. Will await final reads of CT scans,
   change tamiflu to 75mg [**Hospital1 7**] given renal insufficiency, check vanc level
   in AM. Holding lasix gtt and d/c statin given elevated LFTs.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient also has increasing leukocytosis and fevers, indicating a possible bacterial superinfection or primary influenza pneumonia. She has been treated with Tamiflu for H1N1 influenza, but recent swab results were negative for flu. The patient's clinical judgment is that this is flu, so Tamiflu will continue until she is afebrile for 48 hours.

The patient has anemia of unknown etiology, with a positive blood transfusion of 14 liters over her stay. Her hematocrit (HCT) has improved today, but no blood has been given due to fevers. The goal is to maintain HCT above 24.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to contrast nephropathy. She is non-oliguric, and her BUN/Creatinine ratio is increasing, indicating a potential pre-renal component. The goal is to achieve an even fluid balance of up to 500ml positive and continue lasix drip. Renal dosing of medications will be considered, avoiding nephrotoxins, and monitoring trends in HCT and Cr.

The patient also has diabetes mellitus (DM), which will be managed with SSI and glargine 5, along with fasting blood sugar (FSG) qid, DM diet, and HISS.

Furthermore, the patient has hyperlipidemia (HL), and Lipitor will be held due to increasing liver function tests (LFTs).

Overall, the patient's main medical complications include respiratory failure with ARDS, possible bacterial superinfection, anemia, acute renal failure, DM, and HL."

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to suspected H1N1 influenza with a possible bacterial superinfection. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Other medical conditions include pneumonia, anemia, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and depression. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure, likely due to contrast nephropathy. The patient's blood glucose levels need to be monitored closely.

The patient's fluid balance needs to be managed carefully, with a goal of maintaining an even balance to avoid fluid overload. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to manage her renal failure.

The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and she is receiving enteral nutrition. The patient's medication regimen includes antiviral treatment for suspected H1N1 influenza, broad-spectrum antibiotics for potential bacterial superinfection, and medications for her underlying medical conditions.

Overall, the patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) secondary to severe sepsis and ARDS. She requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, renal, and metabolic parameters."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has been febrile for an extended period, which increases the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a need for increased PEEP to maintain adequate oxygenation. This indicates the possibility of ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can occur as a complication of pneumonia or other respiratory insults.

3. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient has a history of risk factors for type II diabetes, such as obesity and possibly nutritional deficiencies. However, further evaluation and testing would be required to confirm this diagnosis.

4. Alteration in nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, indicating a need for nutritional support. Ensuring adequate nutrition is crucial for the patient's recovery and overall health.

5. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to presumed influenza and superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The patient requires continuous broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the infection.

6. Anemia: The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBCs) to address anemia. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and considering further transfusions if necessary is important.

7. Acute renal failure: The patient has nonoliguric acute renal failure, likely multif"

   top of primary influenza pneumonia also with concern for VAP.  Now
   presenting with a diffuse maculopapular rash on the flanks, axilla, and
   upper and lower extremities
 given this new finding it is likely that
   a drug rash is a component to the fevers and rash. Other possible
   etiologies include bacteremia, UTI, and line infection.  CT negative
   for effusion or fluid collection in the abdomen
 Fevers are
   improving, leukocytosis is trending down
   -- Continue Tamiflu 75mg [**Hospital1 **] until afebrile for 48 hours

   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Reculture blood and urine
   -- Hold Vancomycin due to a trough of 24.4
   -- Discuss treatment options, plan, and antibiotic regimen/course with
   ID in the setting of this likely drug rash and fever
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   # Acute renal failure
 Non-oliguric. Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy
   now with potential pre-renal component - BUN/Creatinine ratio improving
   slightly today.
   -- Uine lytes came back pre-renal - Na 0.6%

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has a history of possible H1N1 influenza and pneumonia with suspected bacterial superinfection. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is also experiencing a diffuse maculopapular rash on her flanks, axilla, and upper and lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient meets criteria for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. Current ventilator settings are being maintained, with plans to decrease FiO2 to 40% and maintain PEEP of 16 while monitoring ABG results.

2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, which may be due to H1N1 influenza, bacterial superinfection, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures are pending, and the decision to hold vancomycin is being considered due to a high trough level.

3. Drug Rash: The new finding of a diffuse maculopapular rash could be a drug reaction, especially considering the recent administration of cefepime. Other possible etiologies include bacteremia, UTI, and line infection. Antibiotic regimen and course will be discussed with ID"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with influenza (H1N1) and a possible bacterial infection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has acute renal failure, increased liver function tests, anemia, and diabetes mellitus. She is receiving multiple medications and treatments for her various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and requires close monitoring and management. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the ARDS progresses or if there are complications related to the mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with influenza and a possible bacterial superinfection on top of the primary influenza pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and worsening pneumonia.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which is likely due to contrast nephropathy. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Increased Liver Function Tests: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver injury. Further investigation and monitoring are needed to determine the cause and potential progression.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of unknown etiology. It is important to monitor and manage her hemoglobin levels to prevent further complications.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/51 mmHg to 137/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. 

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with settings of Vt (set) at 470 mL, RR (set) at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP at 16 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and SpO2 of 91%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 174, and HCO3- of 20 mEq/L.

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 16.7 to 22.5 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient also has anemia with a Hct ranging from 24.1% to 26.3%, and acute renal failure with a Cr ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for suspected bacterial superinfection, and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for influenza. The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload.

The patient's care plan includes continuing ventilator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation guidelines, decreasing FiO2 to 40% while maintaining PEEP at 16, and monitoring ABG results. The patient will continue to receive Tamiflu, cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. Renal dosing of medications will be continued, and nephrotoxins will be avoided. The goal is to achieve an even fluid balance and hold lasix drip.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, pneumonia progression, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration of renal function."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She is intubated and sedated, not responding to commands. The patient has a history of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anemia of unknown etiology. She is suspected to have H1N1 influenza from the OSH and possible pneumonia with a superimposed bacterial infection. The patient meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection. She is currently receiving ventilator support with settings of PRVC/AC mode, Vt (set) 470 mL, RR (set) 24, PEEP 16 cmH2O, FiO2 50%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is already complicated by ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs and ventilator settings is crucial to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, suggesting a possible bacterial superinfection on top of primary influenza pneumonia. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other possible etiologies include bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and line infection."

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY/DIFFUSE RASH
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):  Now with
   diffuse rash, likely drug fever in this context.  Cefipime most likely
   culprit.  Will discuss changes in antibiotics regimen with ID service.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  Increase lantus given persistent
   hyperglycemia, consider insulin drip if this continues to be difficult
   to control.
 HYPERKALEMIA:  Insulin/glucose given.  Repeat pending.  No worriesome
   ECG changes.  Will touch base with nutrition to be sure we aren't
   giving her K there.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: Tube feeds at goal.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to contrast dye, some component of
   prerenal state in setting of more aggressive diuresis.  Improved with
   holding further diruresis yesterday ableit also required increased Fi02
   and PEEP on the vent. Would benefit from gentle diuresis from a
   respiratory standpoint so will restart lasix for a goal of [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2673**]
   cc negative over the day.  Dosing vanco and other meds accordingly.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Mutlilobar PNA in setting
   of probable influenza and superimposed bacterial pneumonia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a diagnosis of multilobar pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed a fever, rash, and altered mental status. There are concerns regarding impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, alterations in nutrition, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of a diffuse rash could indicate an infection or allergic reaction, which can lead to further skin breakdown and potential wound complications.
2. ARDS: The patient's condition suggests a severe form of pneumonia, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. This can result in progressive respiratory failure and difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation.
3. Hyperkalemia: Elevated potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other serious complications if not managed promptly.
4. Acute renal failure: Secondary to contrast dye exposure and diuretic use, the patient is at risk for acute kidney injury, which may require dialysis or further interventions.
5. Alterations in nutrition: Prolonged tube feeding can lead to malnutrition and associated complications if not appropriately managed.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory condition can worsen, potentially necessitating more aggressive ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
7. Infection control: The presence of fever and rash raises concerns about potential infections, including healthcare-associated infections, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH and possible infiltrate on CXR
   # Respiratory Failure
 Meets criteria for ARDS
 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 current settings 470/24/16/50% - PaO2 89
 goal of greater than 65
   -- Repeat ABG and if the PaO2 allows, decrease FiO2 to 40% and maintain
   PEEP of 16 and f/u abg 1.5 hours after change to determine where we are
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic acidosis Gap of 12
 based on albumin
   her gap should be [**5-23**].  Likely secondary to uremia
 will follow ABG
   and BUN trend
   #. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 Influenza
   confirmed by DFA at OSH. Patient likely has bacterial superinfection on
   top of primary influenza pneumonia also with concern for VAP.  Now
   presenting with a diffuse maculopapular rash on the flanks, axilla, and
   upper and lower extremities
 given this new finding it is likely that
   a drug rash is a component to the fevers and rash. Other possible
   etiologies include bacteremia, UTI, and line infection.  CT negative
   for effusion or fluid collection in the abdomen
 Fevers are
   improving, leukocytosis is trending down
   -- Continue Tamiflu 75mg [**Hospital1 **] until afebrile for 48 hours
 based on
   clinical suspicion for flu
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Reculture blood and urine
   -- Hold Vancomycin due to a trough of 24.4
   -- Discuss treatment options, plan, and antibiotic regimen/course with
   ID in the setting of this likely drug rash and fever
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   # Acute renal failure
 Non-oliguric. Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy
   now with potential pre-renal component - BUN/Creatinine ratio improving
   slightly today.
   -- Uine lytes came back pre-renal - Na 0.6%
   -- trend Cr
   -- avoid nephrotoxins
   -- renally dose meds
   -- Fluid balance goal of even to 500 to 1000 ml negative
 restart
   lasix drip
   # Increased LFTs
   - Continue to trend
 no intervention at this time
   - Add LFTs to AM labs
   #. Anemia
 unknown etiology
 will continue to monitor

   liters over her stay
 HCT improved today
 No blood given due to

   -- Check Q24 crit to continue to trend
   -- Active T+S
   -- HCT transfusion goal of 24
 currently at 26.2 and stable

   #. DM
   -- Continue covering with SSI and increase glargine to 10
   -- FSG qid, DM diet, HISS

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and suspected H1N1 influenza with a possible bacterial superinfection. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 129/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 45% FiO2.

Her physical examination reveals that she is intubated, sedated, and not responding to commands. She has a tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops. Her lungs are mostly clear but with some rhonchi on posterior lung fields. She has 2+ pitting edema in her upper and lower extremities and dorsalis pedis/posterior tibial pulses. She also has a new erythematous macular popular rash on her flanks, upper and lower extremities, and axilla bilaterally.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count of 372. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus,"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH and possible infiltrate on CXR
   # Respiratory Failure
 Meets criteria for ARDS
 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 current settings 470/24/16/40%
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic acidosis Gap of 10
 will likely
   improve with diruesis
   #. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 Influenza
   confirmed by DFA at OSH. Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to
   bacterial superinfection or even VAP. CT negative for effusion or fluid
   collection in the abdomen
 Fevers are improving, leukocytosis is
   trending down
   -- d/c Tamiflu and vancomycin as patient has already had sufficient
   course
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Follow pending culture
   -- Appreciate ID recs
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   # Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving.
   -- trend Cr
   -- avoid nephrotoxins
   -- renally dose meds
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1.5 L today.
   # Increased LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds.
   - Continue to trend
   - review meds to assess for potential hepatotoxins
   #. Anemia
 Hct stable
   -- Check Q24 Hct to continue to trend
   -- Active T+S
   .
   #. DM
   -- Continue on insulin drip
   -- f/u nutrition recs
   .
   #. HL
   -- Continue to hold lipitor in the setting of increasing LFTs
   .
   # Depression
   -- prozac and amytriptyline are her home meds (no renal adjustment
   necessary)
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NG tube needs to be advanced.  Repeat chest film after
   advancing.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was admitted to the ICU with a suspicion of H1N1 influenza and possible pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode, set at 470 mL tidal volume, 24 breaths per minute, 16 cmH2O PEEP, and 45% FiO2.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia/leukocytosis, fevers, acute renal failure, increased liver function tests, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and depression. Her fever is improving, and leukocytosis is trending down. The patient's renal function is improving, but she still requires close monitoring of her fluid balance and avoidance of nephrotoxins.

The patient's increased liver function tests (LFTs) could be related to infection or medications. Anemia is stable with a Hct of 26.1%. The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with an insulin drip, and her hyperlipidemia is being held due to increasing LFTs. The patient's depression is being managed with her home medications of prozac and amitriptyline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection, complicated by ARDS. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 129/61 mmHg, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.6 thousand cells/microliter, elevated creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests. The patient's condition is improving, but she still requires close monitoring and treatment for various complications, including pneumonia, acute renal failure, increased liver enzymes, anemia, and diabetes mellitus. She is also being managed for her depression and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has suspected H1N1 influenza and a superimposed bacterial infection, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.

 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 current settings 470/24/16/40% - PaO2 89
 goal of greater than 65
   -- Repeat ABG and if the PaO2 allows, decrease FiO2 to 40% and maintain
   PEEP of 16 and f/u abg 1.5 hours after change to determine where we are
   -- Acid Base status

   #. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 Influenza
   confirmed by DFA at OSH. Patient likely has bacterial superinfection on
   top of primary influenza pneumonia also with concern for VAP.  Now
   presenting with a diffuse maculopapular rash on the flanks, axilla, and
   upper and lower extremities
 given this new finding it is likely that
   a drug rash is a component to the fevers and rash. Other possible
   etiologies include bacteremia, UTI, and line infection.  CT negative
   for effusion or fluid collection in the abdomen
 Fevers are
   improving, leukocytosis is trending down
   -- Continue Tamiflu 75mg [**Hospital1 **] until afebrile for 48 hours
 based on
   clinical suspicion for flu
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Reculture blood and urine
   -- Hold Vancomycin due to a trough of 24.4
   -- Discuss treatment options, plan, and antibiotic regimen/course with
   ID in the setting of this likely drug rash and fever
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   # Acute renal failure
 Non-oliguric. Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy
   now with potential pre-renal component - BUN/Creatinine ratio improving
   slightly today.
   -- Uine lytes came back pre-renal - Na 0.6%
   -- trend Cr

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection. This is a serious complication that can result in difficulty breathing and inadequate oxygenation of the blood.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed case of influenza, possibly H1N1, along with a suspected bacterial superinfection on top of primary influenza pneumonia. This increases the risk of worsening lung infection and respiratory failure.

3. Drug Rash: The patient is presenting with a diffuse maculopapular rash on the flanks, axilla, and upper and lower extremities. Given this new finding, it is likely that a drug rash is a component to the fevers and rash. Other possible etiologies include bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and line infection.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to contrast nephropathy from previous procedures. This can lead to impaired kidney function and fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of unknown etiology. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

6. Increased Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated LFTs, which may indicate liver dysfunction. Monitoring and further investigation are"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient has acute respiratory failure and multilobar pneumonia.
- They are sedated and intubated, unable to provide a medical history.
- Fever, hypotension, and altered mental status are observed.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, insulin, and diuretics.
- They have a negative fluid balance and are being given IV fluids.
- There are traces of edema in both lower extremities.
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and impaired skin integrity with a tongue ulcer.
- Imaging shows a nasogastric tube in the esophagus and no significant change in lung fields.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has multilobar pneumonia, which can lead to ARDS. ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Contrast dye load could be the cause of acute renal failure.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a tongue ulcer, indicating impaired skin integrity. This may be due to prolonged intubation or other factors.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has persistent fever despite receiving antibiotics. Further investigation is needed to"

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with settings of 470/24/16/40%. She also has metabolic acidosis with a gap of 10, which is expected to improve with diuresis.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are improving, suggesting that the pneumonia may be responding to treatment. Tamiflu and vancomycin have been discontinued as the patient has already had sufficient courses. Cultures from 11/26 and 11/28 are pending, and follow-up cultures are recommended.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to contrast nephropathy, which is improving. Fluid balance goals should be negative 1.5 L today, and nephrotoxins should be avoided. Medications should be renally dosed.

There are increased liver function tests (LFTs), but the etiology is unclear. Infection or medications could be the cause. LFTs should be trended, and potential hepatotoxins should be reviewed.

The patient has stable hemoglobin levels, and anemia is not a current concern. Active T+S should be continued.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is present, and the patient is on an insulin drip"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS. It is important to continue following ARDSnet ventilation guidelines and monitor her response to the treatment.
2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, which could indicate ongoing infection. Monitoring of culture results is necessary to guide further treatment.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, likely secondary to contrast nephropathy. Close monitoring of serum creatinine levels and maintaining fluid balance is crucial.
4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated LFTs, which may be due to infection or medication. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are stable, but ongoing monitoring is required to assess for any changes.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient is being treated with an insulin drip for glycemic control, and nutrition recommendations should be followed up.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's increasing liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a fever of 102.0°F and is unable to provide history due to being sedated and intubated. Allergies include cefepime with a rash. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics since November 29th. Insulin, furosemide, midazolam, and fentanyl infusions are ongoing. The patient is also receiving lansoprazole and other medications. Review of systems reveals constitutional symptoms, genitourinary issues, heme/lymph nodes, and pain. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, blood pressure ranging from 140/72 to 162/86 mmHg, heart rate between 98 and 109 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are documented. The patient's physical examination reveals signs of overweight/obesity, normal cardiovascular findings, crackles in the chest, right lower extremity edema, and trace left lower extremity edema. Neurological assessment indicates the patient responds to verbal stimuli, movement is not assessed, tone is not assessed, and the patient opens eyes to command. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, sodium, and chloride levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH and possible infiltrate on CXR
 complicated by
   respiratory failure and ARDS
   1. Respiratory Failure
 Meets criteria for ARDS
 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 currently on 40% FiO2
 continue to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis Gap of 9
 will likely
   improve with diruesis
   -- resite A-line
 unable to resite the line yesterday
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
 Patient more alert today
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 Influenza.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection, VAP,
   with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or fluid
   collection in the abdomen
 Fevers are improving, leukocytosis is
   trending down
 Chest X-Ray improving
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Appreciate ID recs
 rescan Abdomen for source of infection
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   -- Continue Cipro and Meropenem
   -- Lines may be another source
 resite a-line
   3. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at 1.2 now
   -- trend Cr
   -- avoid nephrotoxins
   -- appropriately dose antibiotics
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1.5 L today.
   -- Lasix gtt at 10ml/h
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  We will check
   for infectious causes of liver dysfunction.
   -- Continue to trend
   -- F/U hepatitis seriologies
   -- Assess for potential hepatotoxins
   --Rescan Abd per ID
s recs to look for source of infection other than
   pneumonia
   #. Anemia
 Hct stable
   -- Check Q24 Hct to continue to trend
   -- Active T+S
   .
   #. DM
   -- Continue on insulin drip
   -- f/u nutrition recs

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with influenza, possibly H1N1, and a possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient has developed respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. The plan is to continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated. The patient's acid-base status is showing metabolic alkalosis with a gap of 9, which is expected to improve with diuresis.

The patient's leukocytosis and fevers are improving, and the chest X-ray is also showing improvement. Cultures are pending for C. Diff, urine, and blood. The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine level at 1.2. Fluid balance is being closely monitored, aiming for a negative balance of 1.5 L today.

Elevated liver function tests are present, with concerns for acalculous cholecystitis, but this is uncertain. Infectious causes of liver dysfunction are being assessed. The patient has stable hemoglobin levels, and anemia is not currently a concern.

The patient is being managed with an insulin drip for glycemic control and will follow-up with nutrition recommendations. Lipitor has been held due to increasing liver function tests"

   influenza from the OSH and possible infiltrate on CXR
 complicated by
   respiratory failure and ARDS
   1. Respiratory Failure
 Meets criteria for ARDS
 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 currently on 40% FiO2
 continue to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis Gap of 9
 will likely
   improve with diruesis

 unable to resite the line yesterday
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
 Patient more alert today
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 Influenza.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection, VAP,
   with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or fluid
   collection in the abdomen
 Fevers are improving, leukocytosis is
   trending down
 Chest X-Ray improving
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Appreciate ID recs
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   -- Continue Cipro and Meropenem

   -- avoid nephrotoxins
   -- appropriately dose antibiotics
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1.5 L today.
   -- Lasix gtt at 10ml/h
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  We will check
   for infectious causes of liver dysfunction.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and a superimposed bacterial infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 14 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient has several medical complications, including pneumonia/leukocytosis and fevers, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and depression.

The patient's urine culture grew yeast, and the patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and meropenem. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating possible diabetes mellitus.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated lactate levels, and other abnormal values such as low platelet count,"

She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS and is currently on 40% FiO2. It is important to continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, while following ARDSnet ventilation guidelines.

2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient has questionable H1N1 influenza and a protracted clinical course may be due to bacterial superinfection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Fevers are improving, leukocytosis is trending down, and the chest X-Ray is improving. It is important to follow up with pending cultures, appreciate ID recommendations, and continue with appropriate antibiotics.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has contrast nephropathy. Creatinine levels are improving, and it is important to trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins, appropriately dose antibiotics, and maintain a goal of negative 1.5 L fluid balance today.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 188. Her oxygen saturation is 92% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 99 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 119/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and a weight of 120 kg.

The patient has several medical complications, including pneumonia/leukocytosis with questionable H1N1 influenza, acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy, elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with unclear etiology, anemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HL), and depression. The patient's current medications include insulin, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.

The plan includes continuing current ventilator settings, weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, repeating blood gas, and monitoring the patient's acid-base status. Aggressive diuresis will also be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female who was transferred from an outside hospital with symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, suspected to be caused by H1N1 influenza. She has respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her current condition is improving, with wet lungs observed on today's chest X-ray. She is on mechanical ventilation with settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation and is being weaned off FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated. Blood gases are being repeated due to inadequate sedation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is clinically improving, and her current ventilator settings will be continued. She will continue to be weaned off FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient may have H1N1 influenza, which could have led to a protracted clinical course potentially due to bacterial superinfection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or line infection. All lines have been removed, and the patient is now afebrile with a decreasing white blood cell count. Cultures are pending, and antibiotic therapy will be discontinued if no growth is observed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has contrast nephropathy, but her creatinine level is now back at baseline. Renal function will be monitored, and nephrotoxins will be avoided. Medic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP will be continued as tolerated.

2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient has questionable H1N1 influenza, and there is a possibility of bacterial superinfection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or drug fever. Fevers are improving, and leukocytosis is trending down. Further evaluation of pending cultures is necessary to guide treatment.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has contrast nephropathy. Creatinine levels are improving, and measures to avoid nephrotoxins and appropriately dose antibiotics should be continued. Fluid balance should be managed to achieve a negative balance of 1.5 L today.

4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The etiology of elevated LFTs is unclear, but they may be related to infection or medications. Acalculous cholecystitis should be considered, and infectious causes of liver dysfunction should"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient in the ICU is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to probable influenza and a superimposed bacterial process. The patient is unable to provide history due to being sedated and intubated. The patient has a positive Hepatitis A IgG antibody, indicating past infection or vaccination. The patient's allergies include cefepime, which resulted in a rash. The patient was previously on meropenem antibiotics.

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and insulin infusion for glycemic control. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation. The patient's blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and is currently being treated with an insulin drip. The patient's nutritional support is provided through tube feeds. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.

The patient has edema in both lower extremities and diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may be due to the endotracheal tube placement or an underlying lung condition such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, particularly potassium, which has since resolved. The patient's fever has been trending down after the removal of a central line.

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH and possible infiltrate on CXR
   1. Respiratory Failure
 Meets criteria for ARDS
 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 currently back on 50% FiO2.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   from diuresis.  Will use acetazolamide to derease bicarb
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 at OSH.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection or
   even VAP, with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or
   fluid collection in the abdomen
 Currently afebrile, leukocytosis is
   trending down
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Appreciate ID recs
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   3. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.9
 contraction alkalosis
   -- trend Cr
   -- Start acetazolamide 250mg IV TID
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1 L today.
   -- D/C lasix drip and use lasix boluses if necessary to reach fluid
   balance goal
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat
   ultrasound negative.  Transaminases improving in the setting of DC
   antibiotics.
   -- Continue Ursadiol for one more day
   -- Continue to trend
   -- Hep A IgG positive
   -- Hep B S ab negative

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She is suspected to have H1N1 influenza from the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This is likely caused by pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis and fevers, which may indicate pneumonia/leukocytosis and fevers. There is also evidence of acute renal failure, likely related to contrast nephropathy, but improving with a creatinine level of 0.9.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), indicating possible acalculous cholecystitis. However, a repeat ultrasound was negative. Transaminases are improving following the discontinuation of antibiotics.

The patient has a history of depression and diabetes mellitus (DM), and is being managed with appropriate medications and nutrition support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure due to worsening ARDS or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, suspected H1N1 influenza from the OSH, and possible infiltrate on CXR. The patient meets criteria for ARDS likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pneumonia/leukocytosis, and fevers. The patient also has acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and a history of depression. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator and meets the criteria for ARDS. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function and potential need for increased support or prolonged ventilation.
2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient has questionable H1N1 influenza and a possible bacterial superinfection. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or other infections.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has likely contrast nephropathy, but creatinine levels are improving. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The etiology of the elevated liver function tests is unclear, but it could be related to infection or medication. There is a concern for acalculous cholecystitis, although ultrasound results are negative.
5. Depression:"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She is suspected to have H1N1 influenza from the OSH and possibly an infiltrate on CXR. The patient meets criteria for ARDS likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection. She is currently on ventilator support with 50% FiO2.

The patient also has leukocytosis and fevers, which may be related to pneumonia/leukocytosis or drug fever. Cultures are pending from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**].

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to contrast nephropathy. Her creatinine level is now at 0.9, and her fluid balance goal is negative 1.5 L today.

Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are present, with ALT, AST, and AP elevations in a cholestatic pattern. This raises concern for acalculous cholecystitis, but an ultrasound was negative. Transaminases are improving with discontinuation of antibiotics.

Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and depression. The patient is being treated with appropriate medications and interventions for each condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a"

The patient has a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and altered nutrition. The patient is experiencing multiple medical complications, including:

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an imbalance in potassium levels (hyperkalemia) and fluid balance, with a net negative fluid balance of 2,701 mL over the past 24 hours.

2. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient had a macular rash that has since resolved. However, there is no mention of any current skin integrity issues.

4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient's temperature was initially elevated but has since been controlled.

5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of PRVC/AC and a FiO2 of 40%. The respiratory support indicates significant respiratory compromise.

6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): There is mention of acute respiratory failure, but it is noted as separate from ARDS.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multilobar pneumonia, respiratory failure, and other medical conditions. The patient is sedated, intubated, and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/41 mmHg to 135/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's weight is currently 119 kg, and the height is 64 inches.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including furosemide, Fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and lansoprazole. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals overweight/obesity, crackles in the lungs, presence of edema in both lower extremities, and distended abdomen. Neurologic assessment is not possible due to sedation.

The patient's imaging shows stable infiltrates on chest X-ray, and fluid analysis is negative for hepatitis B serologies.

The assessment and plan include renal failure, fever, diabetes mellitus type II, alteration in nutrition, and acute respiratory failure secondary to multilobar pneumonia. The respiratory failure is associated with probable influenza and superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH and possible infiltrate on CXR
   1. Respiratory Failure
 Meets criteria for ARDS
 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 last gas was 7.42/48/116
 decrease PEEP to 12 and check an abg [**1-19**]
   hours after the change.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   from diuresis.  Continue to use acetazolamide to diurese  and decrease
   bicarb for one more day
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 at OSH.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection or
   even VAP, with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or
   fluid collection in the abdomen
 Currently afebrile, leukocytosis is
   trending down
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Appreciate ID recs
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   3. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.8
 contraction alkalosis improving, partially
   autodiuresing
   -- trend Cr
   -- Continue acetazolamide 250mg IV TID
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1 L today.
   -- D/C lasix drip and use lasix boluses if necessary to reach fluid
   balance goal though the combo of acetazolamide and autodiuresing is
   working well.
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat
   ultrasound negative.  Transaminases improving in the setting of DC
   antibiotics.
   -- Continue Ursadiol for one more day
   -- Continue to trend
   -- Hep A IgG positive
   -- Hep B S ab negative

   influenza from the OSH and possible infiltrate on CXR
   1. Respiratory Failure
 Meets criteria for ARDS
 likely due to
   pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection
   complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue ventillator settings in compliance with ARDSnet ventilation
 last gas was 7.42/48/116
 decrease PEEP to 12 and check an abg [**1-19**]
   hours after the change.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   from diuresis.  Continue to use acetazolamide to diurese  and decrease
   bicarb for one more day
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 at OSH.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection or
   even VAP, with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or
   fluid collection in the abdomen
 Currently afebrile, leukocytosis is
   trending down
   -- F/u pending cultures (C. Diff negative today, urine culture no
   growth, blood cx pending) from [**11-26**] and [**11-28**]
   -- Appreciate ID recs
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
   3. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.8
 contraction alkalosis improving, partially
   autodiuresing
   -- trend Cr
   -- Continue acetazolamide 250mg IV TID
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1 L today.
   -- D/C lasix drip and use lasix boluses if necessary to reach fluid
   balance goal though the combo of acetazolamide and autodiuresing is
   working well.
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat
   ultrasound negative.  Transaminases improving in the setting of DC
   antibiotics.
   -- Continue Ursadiol for one more day
   -- Continue to trend

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection, complicated by ARDS. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with settings of PRVC/AC mode, Vt (set) 470 mL, RR (set) 16, PEEP 14 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, PIP 34 cmH2O, and plateau pressure 34 cmH2O. Her SpO2 is maintained at 94%. 

The patient also has leukocytosis and fevers, indicating possible pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures have been taken, including urine culture which showed no growth, and blood culture pending. 

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy, as her creatinine level has improved to 0.9. She is being treated with acetazolamide and fluid restriction to manage metabolic alkalosis.

Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are noted, with unclear etiology. The patient underwent cholecystectomy (CCY) in the past, but an ultrasound showed no evidence of acalculous cholecystitis. Transaminases are improving after discontinuation of antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute respiratory failure and multilobar pneumonia. They are currently sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, renal failure secondary to a dye load, and alteration in nutrition. The patient's respiratory failure is due to multilobar pneumonia caused by influenza and secondary bacterial pneumonia. The patient is being treated with diuresis, tube feeds, and medications for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they have edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's condition is improving, and efforts are being made to decrease PEEP and maintain fluid balance."

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH complicated by ARDS and respiratory failure that
   is currently clinically improving.
   1. Respiratory Failure
 likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1
   and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue weaning ventillator settings as tolerated
 last gas was
   7.40/45/93
 decrease PEEP to 8 and check an abg 1-2 hours after the
   change.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   from diuresis.  Continue to use acetazolamide to diurese  and decrease
   bicarb for one more day
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
   -- Trial of pressure support [**5-22**] this afternoon if PEEP of 8 is
   tolerated and oxygenation is maintained
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 at OSH.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection or
   even VAP, with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or
   fluid collection in the abdomen
 Currently afebrile, leukocytosis is
   trending down
   -- ID signed off
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
 currently afebrile for multiple days
   continue to monitor closely
   3. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.8
 contraction alkalosis improving, partially
   autodiuresing
   -- trend Cr
   -- Stop acetazolamide, allow her to auto diurese, and if she is
   becoming positive or near even, add acetazolamide back
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1 L today..
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat
   ultrasound negative.  Transaminases improving in the setting of DC
   antibiotics.
   -- D/C Ursadiol for one more day
   -- Continue to trend
   -- Hep A IgG positive
   -- Hep B S ab negative
 vaccinate during admission
   #. DM
   -- Continue on SSI
   .
   #. HL
   -- Continue to hold lipitor in the setting of increasing LFTs
   .
   # Depression
   -- Continue prozac

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's vital signs show stable oxygenation with a SpO2 of 94%, but her blood pressure is on the lower side at 88/61 mmHg. Her heart rate is within normal range at 88 bpm, and her respiratory rate is set at 16 breaths per minute. Her body temperature is within normal limits.

Fluid balance shows a negative balance of -1,109 mL since yesterday, indicating appropriate fluid management. Her blood glucose levels have been mostly within normal range, although there was a slightly elevated reading of 151 mg/dL. Other lab results show improvements in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. The plan is to continue weaning ventilator settings as tolerated and decrease PEEP to 8 while monitoring ABG values. Metabolic alkalosis is likely due to contraction alkalosis from diuresis, so acetazolamide will be continued for one more day.

There are also mentions of possible complications such as pneumonia/"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was admitted with suspected H1N1 influenza from the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) organization and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The patient is currently clinically improving.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with ongoing efforts to wean off the ventilator. The plan includes decreasing PEEP to 8 cmH2O and checking an arterial blood gas (ABG) 1-2 hours after the change. Acid-base status is managed with acetazolamide to promote diuresis and decrease bicarbonate levels.

Sedation is being gradually tapered off as tolerated, and a trial of pressure support is planned for later in the day if the patient tolerates PEEP of 8 and maintains adequate oxygenation.

The patient is currently afebrile, and leukocytosis is trending down, indicating improvement in the suspected H1N1 pneumonia. However, there is a concern for bacterial superinfection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Acute renal failure is suspected to be contrast nephropathy, but the patient's creatinine level has improved to 0.8, and the plan is to stop acetazolamide and allow for auto-diuresis. Fluid balance goals include a negative 1"

The patient also has ARDS and respiratory failure, which are currently clinically improving.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. Weaning of ventilator settings should be continued as tolerated, and decreasing PEEP to 8 while monitoring ABG may be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH complicated by ARDS and respiratory failure that
   is currently clinically improving.
   1. Respiratory Failure
 likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1
   and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue weaning ventillator settings as tolerated
 last gas was
   7.40/45/93
 decrease PEEP to 8 and check an abg 1-2 hours after the
   change.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   from diuresis.  Continue to use acetazolamide to diurese  and decrease
   bicarb for one more day
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 at OSH.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection or
   even VAP, with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or
   fluid collection in the abdomen
 Currently afebrile, leukocytosis is
   trending down
   -- ID signed off
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
 currently afebrile for multiple days
   continue to monitor closely
   3. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.8
 contraction alkalosis improving, partially
   autodiuresing
   -- trend Cr
   -- Stop acetazolamide, allow her to auto diurese, and if she is
   becoming positive or near even, add acetazolamide back
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1 L today..
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat
   ultrasound negative.  Transaminases improving in the setting of DC
   antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She is suspected to have H1N1 influenza from the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) organization, complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is clinically improving.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 infection and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. Weaning of ventilator settings should be continued as tolerated, with a decrease in PEEP to 8 and monitoring of an ABG 1-2 hours after the change.

2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction alkalosis from diuresis. Acetazolamide should be continued to diurese and decrease bicarb for one more day.

3. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient may have a protracted clinical course due to bacterial superinfection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with a component of drug fever. Leukocytosis is trending down, and the patient is currently afebrile. Monitoring should continue closely, and Tylenol PRN can be given for fever.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure,"

   influenza from the OSH complicated by ARDS and respiratory failure that
   is currently clinically improving.
   1. Respiratory Failure
 likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1
   and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS
   -- Pt did not tolerate PS [**12-25**], became agitated/dysynchronous/
   desatting slightly during turning so will increase PEEP to 10 and
   possibly 12 today. Likely trial of PS 5/5 tmrw.
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
 currently on  Midazolam 4.5 from 8
   -- cts to be off abx for presumed pna. Remains afebrile
   2. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.8
 contraction alkalosis improving, partially
   autodiuresing
   -- trend Cr
   -- Stop acetazolamide, allow her to auto diurese
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 0.5-1 L today.
   -- will check PM I
s & Os and Use a bolus of Lasix if necessary.
   3. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, with suspected H1N1 influenza from the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is clinically improving, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection. There is a need to adjust the ventilator settings, such as increasing PEEP to 10 and possibly 12, and considering a trial of pressure support (PS) at 5/5 tomorrow. Sedation should be weaned as tolerated.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure due to contrast nephropathy. Creatinine levels are improving, and contraction alkalosis is also improving. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0.5-1 L today. Lasix may be used if necessary.

3. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated LFTs with an unclear etiology, possibly related to infection or medication. This raises concern for acalculous cholecystitis, but an ultrasound was negative. Transaminases are improving after discontinuing antibiotics."

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, questionable H1N1
   influenza from the OSH complicated by ARDS and respiratory failure that
   is currently clinically improving.
   1. Respiratory Failure
 likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1
   and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS
   -- Continue weaning ventillator settings as tolerated
 last gas was
   7.40/45/93
 decrease PEEP to 8 and check an abg 1-2 hours after the
   change.
   -- Acid Base status
 metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   from diuresis.  Continue to use acetazolamide to diurese  and decrease
   bicarb for one more day
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
 currently on  Midazolam 8
   -- Trial of pressure support [**5-22**] this afternoon if PEEP of 8 is
   tolerated and oxygenation is maintained
   2. Pneumonia / leukocytosis and fevers
 Questionable H1N1 at OSH.
   Protracted clinical course may be [**2-19**] to bacterial superinfection or
   even VAP, with a component of drug fever. CT negative for effusion or
   fluid collection in the abdomen
 Currently afebrile, leukocytosis is
   trending down
   -- ID signed off
   -- Tylenol PRN for fever
 currently afebrile for multiple days
   continue to monitor closely
   3. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.8
 contraction alkalosis improving, partially
   autodiuresing
   -- trend Cr
   -- Stop acetazolamide, allow her to auto diurese
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 1 L today. Use a bolus of Lasix if
   necessary.
   4. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat
   ultrasound negative.  Transaminases improving in the setting of DC
   antibiotics.
   -- D/C Ursadiol for one more day
   -- Continue to trend
   -- Hep A IgG positive
   -- Hep B S ab negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with PNA, ARDS, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/59 to 148/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature within normal range. The patient has been weaned off the ventilator and is expected to continue weaning pressure support. The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated blood glucose levels, and altered liver and kidney function tests. The patient's chest X-ray shows stable bilateral infiltrates with an endotracheal tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining good oral hygiene, elevating the head of the bed, and performing regular bronchoscopic evaluations.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin injection should be administered to prevent this complication.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylactic treatment with"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of PNA, ARDS, and respiratory failure. The patient was previously intubated and sedated. Vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.9°C (98.5°F), HR: 87 bpm, BP: 117/59 mmHg, RR: 15 insp/min, SpO2: 94%. The patient has been weaned off the ventilator.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, and review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and others. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 10.6, Hct of 25.8, Plt of 769, Cr of 0.8, TCO2 of 32, Glucose of 147, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

The patient's condition is being monitored closely, and potential medical complications may arise due to the presence of ARDS and respiratory failure. These complications can include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and glycemic control issues. Regular monitoring of vital signs, oxygenation, and laboratory values will be crucial in managing the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and a history of diabetes mellitus type II. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, and blood pressure is slightly low. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are within acceptable limits. The patient's weight has increased since admission.

The respiratory support section indicates that the patient is on pressure-controlled ventilation mode with set tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient's ABG results show a slightly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level.

Physical examination reveals distant breath sounds, indicating possible lung involvement. The patient's abdomen appears benign with quiet bowel sounds. There is trace edema in the extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient has low sodium and potassium levels. Liver function tests are within normal limits, while kidney function may be compromised as indicated by elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present with low calcium and magnesium levels. The CXR reveals stable bilateral infiltrates.

The patient's care plan includes weaning pressure support, diuresis, and increasing PEEP. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding"

   influenza from the OSH complicated by ARDS and respiratory failure that

   1. Respiratory Failure
 likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1
   and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS
   -- Pt did not tolerate PS [**12-25**], became agitated/dysynchronous/
   desatting slightly during turning so will increase PEEP to 10 and
   possibly 12 today. Likely trial of PS 5/5 tmrw.
   -- ct wean sedation as tolerated
 currently on  Midazolam 4.5 from 8
   -- cts to be off abx for presumed pna. Remains afebrile
   2. Acute renal failure
 Likely [**2-19**] contrast nephropathy. Improving,
   Creatinine at now 0.8
 contraction alkalosis improving, partially
   autodiuresing
   -- trend Cr
   -- Stop acetazolamide, allow her to auto diurese
   -- Fluid balance goal of negative 0.5-1 L today.
   -- will check PM I
s & Os and Use a bolus of Lasix if necessary.
   3. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, likely related to infection vs.
   meds. ALT, AST and AP elevations in cholestatic pattern raises concern
   for acalculous cholecystitis; however, pt is s/p CCY.  Repeat

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has led to respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her condition has been improving gradually, with decreased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the initiation of spontaneous breathing trials. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, and her renal function is improving. Her liver function tests are elevated but improving as well. The patient has a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and depression, for which she is receiving appropriate medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is essential. The plan includes decreasing the pressure support as tolerated, weaning sedation, and monitoring ABGs.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to contrast nephropathy. Her current creatinine level is 0.6, which is an improvement from baseline. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial. The plan includes trending creatinine levels, continuing autodiuresis, and maintaining a negative fluid balance of 0.5-1 L today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, type II, currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/87 mmHg to 116/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving various medications, including sedatives (fentanyl and midazolam), antibiotics (heparin sodium), and nutrition (Nutren 2.0). The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, and electrolytes. However, there are elevated levels of blood glucose, lactic acid, and LDH. The patient's chest X-ray shows stable bilateral infiltrates. The plan is to continue weaning pressure support and diurese as appropriate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP due to the potential colonization of the lungs by bacteria.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Vital signs include a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 155/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pain management, and anticoagulant therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of the endotracheal tube and potential colonization of the lower respiratory tract.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the use of central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which may lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge.
3. Stress ulcers: The ICU environment and the use of certain medications can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and is currently on nutrition support. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 155/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on the ventilator. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1058 mL since midnight. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 711 K/uL. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 120-138 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's current medication includes heparin sodium for prophylaxis, fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation, and various ICU medications. The patient's physical examination reveals distant breath sounds in the lungs and trace edema in the extremities. The patient is awake but not following commands.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a current weight of 119 kg, admitted to the ICU. They have a history of diabetes mellitus type II. The patient is intubated, awake, and following commands. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/55 to 155/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode, with a tidal volume of 734 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 109. Physical examination reveals distant breath sounds, benign abdomen, and trace edema in extremities. Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 8.6 g/dL, leukocyte count at 711 K/uL, sodium at 138 mg/dL, potassium at 0.6 mg/dL, glucose at 120 mg/dL, and creatinine at 0.7 mg/dL. Chest X-ray shows stable bilateral infiltrates. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and will continue to wean pressure support. The patient is being diuresed and receiving nutrition through enteral feeding. They have a history of diabetes mellitus type II and are on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, and a suspected H1N1 influenza infection. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition is clinically improving.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation support, and there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if adequate weaning cannot be achieved.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible acute renal failure. This could be due to contrast nephropathy or other factors. Monitoring renal function and managing fluid balance is crucial to prevent worsening of renal function.

3. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's transaminase levels are elevated but improving. Continued monitoring of LFTs is necessary to assess liver function and identify any potential liver complications.

4. Potential Infections: Although the patient is off antibiotics, there is still a risk of ongoing or new infections, especially considering her immunocompromised state due to ARDS and mechanical ventilation.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation, she"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and developed ARDS and respiratory failure. The patient is currently improving clinically and is expected to undergo extubation today. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 99/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is alert and responsive, complaining of discomfort from the endotracheal tube. Fluid balance and renal function are being closely monitored, with a goal of negative 1-1.5 liters fluid balance today. Laboratory results show improving trends in white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Liver function tests are improving as well. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and depression, for which she is receiving appropriate management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to suspected H1N1 influenza and pneumonia, complicated by ARDS. She is currently showing improvement, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure if extubation attempts are unsuccessful or if there is a recurrence of infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure secondary to contrast nephropathy"

   requirements.  Through to this morning patient has had significant
   negative fluid balance and improved mental status and absence of fever
   or concern for increased secretions at this time all making possible
   extubation more favorable through to today.  The most concerning issue
   may be upper airway edema which will be checked with evaluation of cuff
   leak prior to extubation, we will turn sedation off and move to SBT and
   extubation this morning.  We have major concern for weakness following
   extubation and may need intermittent positive pressure ventilation for
   support.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Excellent ABG with minimal Ve requirement ([**6-24**]
   lpm) and will need some significant O2 support following extubation.
   -Will need to check cuff leak and maintain good support for secretion
   clearance following extubation.
   -If she has significant weakness will need to consider modes for
   ventilatory support
   -Patient appears to benefit from continued diuresis but has no evidence
   of acute volume overload.
   -If cuff leak favorable will move to extubation
   -OOB to chair when possible
   -Will move to extubation this morning with sedation weaned off
   -CXR is concerning with persistent multifocal infiltrates

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female who was admitted with hypoexemic respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by H1N1 influenza and later complicated by bacterial pneumonia and renal failure. The patient's condition has shown improvement in renal function and decreased fevers. However, she has experienced prolonged ventilatory failure with persistent pulmonary edema, excess sedation, and high PEEP requirements.

The patient has had a significant negative fluid balance and improved mental status. There are concerns about upper airway edema, which will be evaluated with an assessment of cuff leak before extubation. The plan is to turn off sedation, move to spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and extubate the patient this morning. There is a major concern for weakness following extubation, and the possibility of needing intermittent positive pressure ventilation for support.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may require significant O2 support following extubation. It will be important to check for cuff leak and maintain good support for secretion clearance. If the patient has significant weakness, modes for ventilatory support may need to be considered.
2. Agitation: The patient may benefit from medication such as Methadone or Zyprexa to manage agitation.

Other ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren 2.0, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, arterial and PICC lines for monitoring and medication administration, prophylaxis for D"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has a history of influenza from OSH complicated by ARDS and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but has now been successfully extubated and is alert and oriented. She has a rash from cefepime but it has resolved. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 160/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight is currently 119 kg, with a height of 64 inches. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 428 mL and a total output of 1655 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1227 mL. She is receiving high flow neb with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode, with a Vt of 360 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR of 17, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, PIP of 15 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 93%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 41, HCO3 of 198, PO2 of 330, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 330. 

The patient's physical examination reveals general extubation with appropriate conversation, wearing high flow neb, normocephalic head, atraumatic, PERRL, improving tongue laceration, no murmurs, clear breath sounds bilaterally, obesity with normoactive bowel sounds, soft abdomen, no tenderness or drainage, trace edema in bilateral lower extremities, and a resolved rash. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 660 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 138 mg/dL, and a magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS, which is currently clinically improving. The patient will continue with Zyprexa PRN agitation, NIPPV PRN, speech and swallow evaluation today, and PT/OT evaluation for rehab placement. The patient also has acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy, with a current creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. The plan is to trend creatinine, continue autodiuresis, and aim for a negative fluid balance of 1-1.5L today"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with influenza, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her condition has been improving, and she was successfully extubated today. She is also experiencing acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy and has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) that are improving with the discontinuation of antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and any signs of deterioration should be promptly addressed.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function should be monitored regularly, and fluid balance should be managed carefully to prevent further deterioration.

3. Elevated liver function tests: The patient's liver function should continue to be monitored, and any further increases should be evaluated for potential causes.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to prolonged immobilization. Prophylactic measures such as venodynes and heparin should be continued to prevent DVT.

5. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be continued.

6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although"

She has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but has now been successfully extubated and is doing well.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/77 to 92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 110 kg at admission to 119 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 620 mL in the past 24 hours and a total output of 1,396 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 776 mL. Her respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hematocrit (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Her creatinine levels are within normal range. Other lab values including electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac markers are also within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She is suspected to have H1N1 influenza from her previous employment at OSH, which complicated by ARDS and respiratory failure. She was initially intubated but is now extubated and showing improvement in her breathing. However, she remains confused and disoriented. The patient has been receiving various treatments including oxygen supplementation, heparin for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. This condition requires close monitoring of oxygen requirements and continued oxygen supplementation as needed.

2. Confusion/Delirium: The patient's confusion is likely due to delirium secondary to long hospitalization and incubation. There are no signs of active infection, so monitoring the patient's mental status is crucial. The underlying cause should be addressed, and supportive care should be provided.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and hospitalization. Prophylactic measures, such as venodynes and heparin subcutaneously, have been initiated to prevent DVT formation.

4. Stress Ulcer: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with obesity who was admitted with H1N1 and subsequent hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been successfully extubated after a prolonged course of ventilatory dependence. Her respiratory status has been stable following extubation, and she has tolerated the wean of oxygen level support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her previous hypoxemic respiratory failure and obesity. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygen levels is necessary.
2. Altered Mental Status - The patient has diffuse encephalopathy with no focal defects on neuro exam. This could be related to medication effects or residual effects from hypoxemia during the acute illness. Close monitoring for any changes in mental status is important.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder - The patient has hyperkalemia (high potassium) and impaired skin integrity. These conditions should be addressed and managed accordingly.
4. Renal Failure, Acute - The patient may have acute renal failure as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Monitoring kidney function and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Fever - The patient has a fever, which could be due to an infection or other underlying cause. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fever and initiate appropriate treatment if necessary.
6. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) - The patient has a history of ARDS, which can lead to acute lung"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The patient was initially intubated but is now extubated and doing well.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. The patient requires ongoing monitoring and oxygen supplementation as needed.

2. Confusion: The patient is likely experiencing delirium secondary to long hospitalization and incubation. There are no signs of active infection, so monitoring the patient's mental status is essential.

Other ongoing care includes nutrition (advancing diet as tolerated to regular), glycemic control (RISS), and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is also on venodynes and heparin for DVT prophylaxis, as well as a proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's disposition is planned for a rehabilitation facility."

   Disposition:  rehab facility today
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She was admitted to the ICU with suspected H1N1 influenza, pneumonia, and ARDS. The patient has been extubated and is currently on oxygen supplementation as needed. Her confusion is likely due to delirium secondary to long hospitalization and incubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has trace edema in bilateral lower extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. The patient is expected to be transferred to a rehab facility today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia with suspected H1N1 influenza and superimposed bacterial infection complicated by ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygen requirement and ongoing respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Confusion/Delirium: The patient's confusion is likely secondary to long hospitalization and incubation. Regular monitoring for any changes in mental status and appropriate management of delirium symptoms should be considered.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization. Prophylactic measures such as venodynes and heparin SC should be continued.
4. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylactic PPI should be continued.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   63-year-old woman admitted with respiratory failure felt due to
   influenza, pneumonia and ARDS (although it is a bit uncertain about the
   confirmatory testing for H1N1, which was at OSH).  Had severe ARDS but
   has now entered recovery phase and doing well extubated.  Episodes of
   hypoxemia from last night responded to incentive spirometry; chest
   radiograph showed overall improvement of radiographic opacities.  Her
   encephalopathy is likely related to toxic/metabolic effects of illness
   and medications; by report it is slowly improving.  She needs pulmonary
   rehab and physical therapy, as well as ongoing supplemental O2 and
   respiratory monitoring.  We will plan to transfer to inpatient rehab
   when bed is available.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman admitted with respiratory failure due to influenza, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The note mentions that while there is uncertainty about confirmatory testing for H1N1, it was suspected at OSH. The patient initially had severe ARDS but has now entered the recovery phase and is doing well after being extubated. 

The patient experienced episodes of hypoxemia last night, which responded to incentive spirometry. A chest radiograph showed overall improvement of radiographic opacities. Her encephalopathy is likely related to toxic/metabolic effects of illness and medications, and it is slowly improving. 

The patient requires pulmonary rehab and physical therapy, as well as ongoing supplemental O2 and respiratory monitoring. It is planned to transfer her to inpatient rehab when a bed is available. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving an oral diet based on her symptoms, glycemic control, and has a PICC line inserted on [**2187-12-4**] at 08:36 PM. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) includes wearing boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. Stress ulcer prophylaxis is being provided with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
