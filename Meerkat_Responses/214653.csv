   58M with a history of untreated HCV complicated by cirrhosis,
   esophageal cancer s/p cisplatin, 5FU, and XRT, and a prolonged
   admission for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline
   who was transfered back to the MICU for hypotension. Of note, over the
   past few days his WBC has been rising, his creatinine has been rising,
   and his Tbili has been rising. He is afebrile, but hypotensive. His
   abdomen is tender and his peritoneal fluid leak is concerning for a
   nidus of infection. He has a positive UA. Overall he appears to be
   going into sepsis again, either from SBP, urosepsis, or possibly PNA.
   .
   # Hypotension: The likely cause here is sepsis. The source is likely
   urosepsis or peritonitis. His ECHO is not consistent with a cariogenic
   cause or PE. He is intravascularly volume depleted.
   - Levophed titrated to MAP > 65
   - Fluid resusitation with NS and albumin for CVP of 10
   - Treat sepsis as below
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt has climbing WBC, abdominal pain, worsening renal and
   hepatic function, and a positive UA. All of this points to sepsis
   leading to hepatic decompensation. CXR relatively unchanged.

   before fourth dose for Gram positive coverage
   - Continue CefePIME 2 g IV Q24H for Gram negative coverage
   - Treat hypotension as above

   # Acute renal insufficiency: Likely related to a combination of
   hypotension and splanchnic vasodilation due to liver disease.
   - Treat SBP as appropriate
   - Maintain MAP > 65 with pressors and fluids

   - Consider octreotide for HRS if low urine Na

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of untreated hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and esophageal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline. The patient's white blood cell count has been rising, creatinine levels have been increasing, and bilirubin levels have been rising as well. He is currently hypotensive and experiencing abdominal pain. His peritoneal fluid leak is concerning for a possible infection. There are signs of sepsis, possibly due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infection (UTI), or pneumonia (PNA). The patient's condition appears to be deteriorating, with liver decompensation and renal insufficiency. His oxygenation has improved with diuresis, but he remains hypoxic and tachypneic. A peritoneal fluid leak in the right lower quadrant has been sutured to slow the flow. The patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, with a MELD score of 29. He also has coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and esophageal cancer. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.

   going into sepsis again, either from SBP, urosepsis, or possibly PNA.
   .
   # Drop in Hematocrit:  Possibly [**2-27**] occult hemorrhage, though no
   apparent source or inciting event.  Given paracentesis in the setting
   of coagulopathy and high risk of bleed, will investigate
   abdominal/pelvic sources of bleed.
   - Abdominal ultrasound to r/o bleed
   - Peripheral smear
   - Fibrinogen level to determine if pt needs cryoprecipitate
   - Trend PM hct
   - DAT (Coombs test) to r/o hemolysis

   # Hypotension: The likely cause here is sepsis. The source is likely
   urosepsis or peritonitis or PNA. His ECHO is not consistent with a
   cariogenic cause or PE. He is intravascularly volume depleted.
   - Administer Albumin for low CVP (goal ~10); hold on fluids for now to
   minimize third spacing
   - Levophed titrated to MAP > 65

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of untreated HCV complicated by cirrhosis, esophageal cancer status post cisplatin, 5FU, and XRT. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline. The patient has been experiencing rising WBC count, rising creatinine, and rising direct bilirubin. He is currently hypotensive, afebrile, and has tender abdomen with peritoneal fluid leak, which is concerning for a nidus of infection. The patient appears to be going into sepsis again, possibly from SBP, urosepsis, or PNA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has shown signs of fluid imbalance with positive fluid balance and a drop in hematocrit. He is also hypotensive, indicating a possible electrolyte and fluid disorder.
2. Shock, Septic: The patient's clinical presentation suggests septic shock, evidenced by hypotension, rising WBC count, and signs of infection.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation may indicate the development of ARDS.
4. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient is on lactulose, which can cause diarrhea, but it may also contribute to constipation or obstipation.
5. Pleural Disease: The patient's chest X-ray"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of untreated HCV complicated by cirrhosis, esophageal cancer treated with cisplatin, 5FU, and XRT, and a prolonged admission for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline. The patient was transferred back to the MICU for hypotension. 

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder
2. Altered Mental Status (not delirium)
3. Shock, Septic
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Acute Lung Injury
5. Constipation (obstipation, FOS)
6. Pleural Disease, Other
7. Pain Control (acute pain, chronic pain)
8. Ascites

The patient appears to be going into sepsis again, possibly from SBP, urosepsis, or PNA. The likely cause of hypotension is sepsis, and the source is likely urosepsis or peritonitis. The patient's ECHO is not consistent with a cardiogenic cause or PE. He is intravascularly volume depleted.

The plan includes administering albumin for low CVP, holding on fluids for now, Levophed titrated to MAP > 65, fluid resuscitation with NS and albumin for CVP of 10, treating sepsis as below, and awaiting pending cultures and"

   who was transfered back to the MICU for hypotension. Of note, over the
   past few days his WBC has been rising, his creatinine has been rising,
   and his Tbili has been rising. He is afebrile, but hypotensive. His
   abdomen is tender and his peritoneal fluid leak is concerning for a
   nidus of infection. He has a positive UA. Overall he appears to be
   going into sepsis again, either from SBP, urosepsis, or possibly PNA.

   # Drop in Hematocrit:  Possibly [**2-27**] occult hemorrhage, though no
   apparent source or inciting event.  Given paracentesis in the setting
   of coagulopathy and high risk of bleed, will investigate
   abdominal/pelvic sources of bleed.
   - Abdominal ultrasound to r/o bleed
   - Peripheral smear
   - Fibrinogen level to determine if pt needs cryoprecipitate

   # Hypotension: The likely cause here is sepsis. The source is likely
   urosepsis or peritonitis or PNA. His ECHO is not consistent with a
   cariogenic cause or PE. He is intravascularly volume depleted.

   minimize third spacing
   - Levophed titrated to MAP > 65

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of untreated HCV, complicated by cirrhosis, esophageal cancer treated with cisplatin, 5FU, and XRT, and a prolonged admission for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline. The patient has been transferred back to the MICU for hypotension. The patient's WBC count has been rising, creatinine levels have been rising, and total bilirubin has been rising. He is afebrile but hypotensive with tender abdomen and peritoneal fluid leak, concerning for a nidus of infection. There is a positive urine analysis, indicating possible urosepsis or peritonitis. The patient's condition appears to be going into sepsis again, possibly from SBP, urosepsis, or PNA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has a low hematocrit level, which could indicate an occult hemorrhage or fluid loss.
2. Shock, Septic: The patient is hypotensive, suggesting septic shock, likely caused by urosepsis or peritonitis.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Acute Lung Injury: The patient has hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating ARDS or acute lung injury.
4. Constipation/Obsipation: The patient has been given lactulose for hepatic en"

   1. Moderate-to-large amount of ascites is identified, without
   significant
   interval change since prior ultrasound [**2130-12-24**].
   2. No obvious debris within the ascites to suggest recent
   intraperitoneal
   hemorrhage. However, if there is clinical concern of hemorrhage and/or
   perforation, cross-sectional imaging with CT should be considered.
   3. A left basal pleural effusion is seen.
   Microbiology: NTD
   Assessment and Plan
   58M with a history of untreated HCV complicated by cirrhosis,
   esophageal cancer s/p cisplatin, 5FU, and XRT, and a prolonged
   admission for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline
   who was transfered back to the MICU for hypotension. Of note, over the
   past few days his WBC has been rising, his creatinine has been rising,
   and his Tbili has been rising. He is afebrile, but hypotensive. His
   abdomen is tender and his peritoneal fluid leak is concerning for a
   nidus of infection. He has a positive UA. Overall he appears to be
   going into sepsis again, either from SBP, urosepsis, or possibly PNA.
   .
   # Drop in Hematocrit:  Possibly [**2-27**] occult hemorrhage, though no
   apparent source or inciting event.  Given paracentesis in the setting
   of coagulopathy and high risk of bleed, will investigate
   abdominal/pelvic sources of bleed.  Hct increased and is stable at 32
   this morning.  Peripheral smear normal.  Fibrinogen >100
   - Trend PM hct
   - DAT (Coombs test) to r/o hemolysis
   .
   # Hypotension: The likely cause here is sepsis. The source is likely
   urosepsis or peritonitis or PNA. His ECHO is not consistent with a
   cariogenic cause or PE. He is intravascularly volume depleted.
   - Administer Albumin for low CVP (goal ~10); will get paracentesis and
   then albumin after.
   - d/c levophed
   - Treat sepsis as below
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt has climbing WBC, abdominal pain, worsening renal and
   hepatic function, and a positive UA. All of this points to sepsis
   leading to hepatic decompensation. CXR relatively unchanged.
   - BCx, Ucx, sputum cx, peritoneal fluid cx pending
   - Cdiff toxin assay pending given diarrhea - but likely due to
   lactulose diarrhea
   - Diagnostic paracentesis done. Awaiting results. Will treat as
   appropriate.
   - Continue Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H D1 [**2130-12-26**] with trough level
   tomorrow morning.  This morning dose was held d/t high vancomycin, but
   this patient has improved renal function so will wait to change dosing
   based on tomorrow
s trough
   - Continue CefePIME 2 g IV Q24H for Gram negative coverage
   .
   # Acute renal insufficiency: Likely related to a combination of
   hypotension and splanchnic vasodilation due to liver disease.
   - Albumin given
   - Treat SBP as appropriate
   - Maintain MAP > 65 with pressors and fluids as needed
   - Ulytes pending
   - Consider octreotide for HRS if low urine Na
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improved with diuresis overnight by report. On 60% FM
   intially, but weaned quickly to 40% FM. Tachnypneic to 30 at times.
   - Continue 40% FM
   - Most recent ABG 7.36/36/102
   - Avoid excessive fluids as this seems to have exacerbated hypoxia
   earlier
   - Treat infection as above
   - PE unlikely given ECHO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely related to underlying liver disease and
   underproduction of coagulation factors.
   - Give platelets and FFP before paracentesis today
   - Follow INR; INR goal 2 given risk of bleed and acute drop in Hct.
   FFP as needed to maintain goal INR
   - Replete with FFP if bleeding or if INR <2 as above
   .
   # Peritoneal fluid leak in RLQ: Sutured to slow flow
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Secondary to HCV. MELD of 29.
   - Continue Lactulose 45 mL PO/NG TID
   - Continue Rifaximin 400 mg PO/NG TID
   .
   # Thombocytopenia: Consistent with underproduction of thrombopoeitin
   from cirrhosis
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or PLT<10
   - Giving PLT for diagnostic para
   .
   # Esophageal cancer: Not clearly contributing to present illness, but
   overall carries a poor prognosis. Unclear if recurred. No recent
   staging studies. Will address as appropriate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of untreated HCV complicated by cirrhosis, esophageal cancer, and prolonged hospital admission for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline. He was transferred back to the MICU for hypotension. The patient's recent laboratory results show rising WBC, creatinine, and bilirubin levels. He is afebrile but hypotensive, with tender abdomen and peritoneal fluid leak concerning for a nidus of infection. The patient appears to be going into sepsis again, possibly due to SBP, urosepsis, or PNA. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Drop in Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit dropped, which could be due to occult hemorrhage. Investigation is needed for abdominal/pelvic sources of bleed.
2. Hypotension: The likely cause of hypotension is sepsis, possibly urosepsis or peritonitis or PNA. The patient is intravascularly volume depleted.
3. Sepsis: The patient has climbing WBC, abdominal pain, worsening renal and hepatic function, and positive UA, indicating sepsis leading to hepatic decompensation.
4. Acute renal insufficiency: The patient has acute renal insufficiency likely related to hypotension and splanchnic vasodilation due to liver disease.

   2. No obvious debris within the ascites to suggest recent
   intraperitoneal
   hemorrhage. However, if there is clinical concern of hemorrhage and/or
   perforation, cross-sectional imaging with CT should be considered.
   3. A left basal pleural effusion is seen.
   Microbiology: NTD
   Assessment and Plan
   58M with a history of untreated HCV complicated by cirrhosis,
   esophageal cancer s/p cisplatin, 5FU, and XRT, and a prolonged
   admission for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline
   who was transfered back to the MICU for hypotension. Of note, over the
   past few days his WBC has been rising, his creatinine has been rising,
   and his Tbili has been rising. He is afebrile, but hypotensive. His
   abdomen is tender and his peritoneal fluid leak is concerning for a
   nidus of infection. He has a positive UA. Overall he appears to be
   going into sepsis again, either from SBP, urosepsis, or possibly PNA.
   .
   # Drop in Hematocrit:  Possibly [**2-27**] occult hemorrhage, though no
   apparent source or inciting event.  Given paracentesis in the setting
   of coagulopathy and high risk of bleed, will investigate
   abdominal/pelvic sources of bleed.  Hct increased and is stable at 32
   this morning.  Peripheral smear normal.  Fibrinogen >100
   - Trend PM hct
   - DAT (Coombs test) to r/o hemolysis
   .
   # Hypotension: The likely cause here is sepsis. The source is likely
   urosepsis or peritonitis or PNA. His ECHO is not consistent with a
   cariogenic cause or PE. He is intravascularly volume depleted.
   - Administer Albumin for low CVP (goal ~10); hold on fluids for now to
   minimize third spacing
   - Levophed titrated to MAP > 65
   - Treat sepsis as below
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt has climbing WBC, abdominal pain, worsening renal and
   hepatic function, and a positive UA. All of this points to sepsis
   leading to hepatic decompensation. CXR relatively unchanged.
   - BCx, Ucx, sputum cx, peritoneal fluid cx pending
   - Cdiff toxin assay pending given diarrhea - but likely due to
   lactulose diarrhea
   - Diagnostic paracentesis done. Awaiting results. Will treat as
   appropriate.
   - Continue Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H D1 [**2130-12-26**] with trough level
   before fourth dose for Gram positive coverage
   - Continue CefePIME 2 g IV Q24H for Gram negative coverage
   - Place a-line today for acccess
   .
   # Acute renal insufficiency: Likely related to a combination of
   hypotension and splanchnic vasodilation due to liver disease.
   - Albumin given
   - Treat SBP as appropriate
   - Maintain MAP > 65 with pressors and fluids as needed
   - Ulytes pending
   - Consider octreotide for HRS if low urine Na
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improved with diuresis overnight by report. On 60% FM
   intially, but weaned quickly to 40% FM. Tachnypneic to 30 at times.
   - Continue 40% FM
   - Most recent ABG 7.36/36/102
   - Avoid excessive fluids as this seems to have exacerbated hypoxia
   earlier
   - Treat infection as above
   - PE unlikely given ECHO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely related to underlying liver disease and
   underproduction of coagulation factors.
   - Follow INR; INR goal 2 given risk of bleed and acute drop in Hct.
   FFP as needed to maintain goal INR
   - Replete with FFP if bleeding or if INR <2 as above
   .
   # Peritoneal fluid leak in RLQ: Sutured to slow flow
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Secondary to HCV. MELD of 29.
   - Continue Lactulose 45 mL PO/NG TID
   - Continue Rifaximin 400 mg PO/NG TID

   # Thombocytopenia: Consistent with underproduction of thrombopoeitin
   from cirrhosis
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or PLT<10

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of untreated HCV, complicated by cirrhosis, esophageal cancer, and previous chemotherapy. He has been admitted multiple times for hypotension, respiratory distress, and general decline. The patient's WBC count has been rising, creatinine levels have been increasing, and total bilirubin has been rising. He is currently hypotensive, with a tender abdomen and peritoneal fluid leak, suggesting a potential infection. The patient also has a positive urine analysis. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 120/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving stress dose steroids due to a cosyntropin test, and his Hct has been increased to 30. He has ascites without any obvious bleed, as well as a left pleural effusion. Imaging shows asymmetric ground-glass opacities on the left side, partially due to pulmonary edema. The patient's blood work indicates rising WBC, elevated creatinine, and increasing total bilirubin levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation, including hypotension, rising WBC count, positive urine analysis, and tender abdomen with peritoneal fluid leak, suggests the possibility of sepsis. 
2. Ac"

   Explained to him the [**Known firstname 4883**] is doing poorly.  He has had recurrent
   hypotension, and recurrent infections and difficulty breathing.  These
   are caused by his underlying severe liver disease and general
   dehabilitation from the liver disease and the cancer.  He has reached a
   point where the chances of him ever leaving the hospital are extremely
   small, and given the large amount of discomfort and suffering that he
   is enduring, the patient may not want further aggressive care.  Given
   that [**Known firstname 4883**] is encephalopathic, we are asking, [**Doctor First Name 7471**], his HCP if he

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with end-stage cirrhosis and esophageal cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with recurrent hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has been critically ill, experiencing multiple complications such as septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), constipation, and altered mental status. His condition has been deteriorating despite treatment, and the prognosis is very poor due to severe liver disease, cancer, and generalized debilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's recurrent hypotension and infections suggest septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to systemic inflammation and organ failure.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's impaired ventilation and poor secretion clearance indicate the possibility of ARDS, a condition characterized by severe lung inflammation resulting in low oxygen levels in the blood.
3. Liver failure: The patient's end-stage cirrhosis indicates advanced liver disease, which can lead to liver failure. This can result in complications like hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
4. Esophageal cancer: The patient's underlying esophageal cancer can contribute to his overall poor prognosis and may cause complications such as dysphagia, weight loss, and malnutrition.
5. Constipation: The patient's constipation and obstipation require management to prevent further complications like fecal impaction and perforation"
