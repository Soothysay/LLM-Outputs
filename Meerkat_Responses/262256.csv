   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea in setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: [**Month (only) 51**] represent volume overload in setting of high output
   heart failure, vs. acute PE.  PE not unlikely given bilateral leg edema
   and signs of right heart failure and unchanged CXR.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions c/w CHF, although can
t rule out possibility of infectious
   pulmonary process given persistent fevers. Possibly [**3-7**] to chronic
   aspiration +/- infection.  Will continue vanco/zosyn and add cipro for
   resistant GNR's.  No clear benefit to flagyl at this time.
   - Hemodynamically stable for now
   - Trial of Lasix given anasarca and monitor for improvement of
   respiratory status
   - Obtain echo to evaluate systolic function, effusion, RV dysfunction.
   - LE U/S to r/o DVT
   - Obtain CTA chest to r/o PE; Will get CT head and torso together which
   will also allow for evaluation for empyema/ abcesses/ other foci of
   infection as pt may be chronically aspirating
   - nebulizers
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, add cipro for double coverage of GNR's given
   acute decompensation and consider peeling off pending sputum, clinical
   improvement, CXR findings.
   - Continue following serial VBGs to monitor resp status
   - Check NIF and vital capacity
   - Consider thoracentesis for symptomatic relief
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach by telemetry/ECG, no acute ST/Tchanges, but
   with newly low voltage.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent lead placement/soft tissue
   impedence changes, but would consider tamponade as cause for
   tachycardia (although not hypotensive, no change on CXR).  More likely
   [**3-7**] to fever, distress. Clinically appears to have been adequately
   volume-resuscitated, thus dehydration is unlikely as the source of
   tachycardia.
   - Echo for e/o RV dysfunction, effusion, systolic function.
   - control pain, anxiety/air hunger.
   - Control fever
   .
   # Fevers: Pan-cultured on arrival. Clinically aside from tachycardia
   and fever patient does not appear septic.  Lactic acid normal,
   extensive cultures negative to date, and no leukocytosis. [**Month (only) 51**] need
   thoracentesis given very large bilateral pleural effusions to improve
   respiratory status as well as r/o of empyema (although low suscipion).
   Finished 10 day course of empiric abx for PNA.
   Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that showed only 2
   WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr.  Skin exam not
   showing any break-down thus decub ulcer is not the source of fever. No
   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever low although in
   differential. With a feeding tube in place, may have occult sinusitis.
   High suspicion for ongoing aspiration given pt
s somewhat somnolent
   state and decreased ability to protect airways.
   - Nasal wash/ oral hygiene
   - consider thoracentesis.
   - pan-culture
   - continue antibiotics, and add cipro for now although unlikely
   resistant GNR at this time.
   - CT scan of head and torso for foci of infection
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever.
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, last echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   - Neuro following
   - Unclear if PO adequate at this time, and would consider IV
   supplementation if concern for absorption arises.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of
   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for
   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction
   and possible seizure.  given fevers would consider LP to evaluate for
   possible CNS infection.
   - Neurology recommended repeat LP on [**2191-3-31**]
   - Original CSF profile not c/w CNS infection
   - LFTs stable.
   - Start Lactulose/rifaxamin although as per liver unlikely cause for
   change in MS.
   - Continue keppra, check level
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Hct stable.
   - Check PM Hct
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - F/u Echo
   - Keep an active Type and cross
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Last INR 1.8, partly nutritional with question of
   underlying liver disease.  Was with etoh hepatitis earlier this admit.
   - Vit K given
   - Monitor LFT's
   - FFP PRN
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, hold tube feeds for now in
   preparation of CT head/torso, restart when completed and pt alert
   enough.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beriberi who was admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea. The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes tachypnea, tachycardia, fever, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and chronic aspiration, which may contribute to the development of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, for resistant Gram-negative rods. Other medications include furosemide for volume overload, thiamine repletion for beriberi, and lactulose/rifaximin for possible hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and continues to have fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infectious process in the lungs.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has bilateral leg edema and signs of right heart failure, which increases the suspicion for PE. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) chest will be obtained to rule out PE.
3. Empyema: The patient has large bilateral pleural effusions, which could potentially be empyemas. Thoracentesis may be necessary for both symptomatic relief and to rule out infection.
4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's hyperdynamic echo suggests possible cardiac dysfunction,"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beriberi, who was transferred to the ICU for acute tachycardia/dyspnea in the setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.0 F, heart rate of 137 bpm, blood pressure of 122/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been diagnosed with volume overload, possibly due to high output heart failure or acute pulmonary embolism. There are signs of right heart failure and bilateral pleural effusions, which may be related to chronic heart failure or aspiration +/- infection. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected resistant Gram-negative rods, and ciprofloxacin has been added for double coverage. 

The patient's tachycardia is attributed to sinus tachycardia by telemetry/ECG, with no acute ST/T changes. However, there is a concern for cardiac tamponade given the low voltage on ECG and hypotension. An echocardiogram has been ordered to evaluate for right ventricular dysfunction and effusion. 

The patient's fevers are not clearly explained, as extensive cultures have been negative to date, and there is no leukocytosis. A lumbar puncture (LP)"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea in setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: [**Month (only) 51**] represent volume overload in setting of high output
   heart failure, vs. acute PE.  PE not unlikely given LE edmea and signs
   of right heart failure and unchanged CXR.  b/l Pleural effusions c/w
   CHF, however.  Possibly [**3-7**] to aspiration +/- infection.  Will continue
   vanco/zosyn and add cipro for resistant GNR's.  No clear benefit to
   flagyl at this time.
   - add-on BNP, diurese, sputum cultures, nebulizers
   - Echo for systolic function, effusion, RV dysfunction.
   - LE USD for DVT
   - Obtain CTA chest to r/o PE
   - nebulizers
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, add cipro for double coverage of GNR's given
   acute decompensation and consider peeling off pending sputum, clinical
   improvement, CXR findings.
   - Trend CO2 for e/o hypercarbic respiratory failure and
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach by telemetry/ECG, no acute ST/Tchanges, but
   with newly low voltage.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent lead placement/soft tissue
   impedence changes, but would consider tamponade as cause for
   tachycardia (although not hypotensive, no change on CXR).  More likely
   [**3-7**] to fever, distress.
   - Echo for e/o RV dysfunction, effusion, systolic function.
   - pulsus of 10mmHg on exam, trend
   - follow HR
   - control pain, anxiety/air hunger.
   - control fever curve
   .
   # Fevers: Pan-culture on arrival.  Clinically aside from tachycardia
   and fever patient does not appear septic.  Lactic acid normal,
   extensive cultures negative to date, and no leukocytosis.  Consider LP
   given altered mental status, and consider thoracentesis given pleural
   effusions although bilateral and h/o High output failure makes empyema
   less likely.  Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that
   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr.
   Currently, unclear if patient would tolerate LP from respiratory
   stand-point.
   - consider LP
   - consider thoracentesis.
   - pan-culture
   - continue antibiotics, and add cipro for now although unlikely
   resistant GNR at this time.
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, last echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   - Neuro following
   - Unclear if PO adequate at this time, and would consider IV
   supplementation if concern for absorption arises.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of
   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for
   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction
   and possible seizure.  given fevers would consider LP to evaluate for
   possible CNS infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beriberi, currently admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea in the setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient's rapid breathing could be due to volume overload in the setting of high-output heart failure or a possible acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and signs of right heart failure suggest the possibility of a PE. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest is recommended to rule out PE.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate is likely caused by sinus tachycardia, possibly secondary to fever and distress. However, the low voltage on the electrocardiogram (ECG) raises concern for cardiac tamponade. An echocardiogram should be performed to assess for right ventricular dysfunction, effusion, and systolic function.

3. Fevers: Despite extensive cultures being negative and no leukocytosis, the patient's fever persists. A lumbar puncture (LP) could be considered to evaluate for possible central nervous system infection, especially given the altered mental status. Additionally, a thoracentesis may be warranted to analyze the ple"

   the main reason for tachypnea. This bilateral pleural effusion, which
   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to
   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process
   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.
   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although
   limited by motion.
   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage
   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small
   pericardial effusion.
   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component
   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.
   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle
   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)
 no definite
   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been
   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.
   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the
   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric
   coverage. Will need thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic
   purposes.
   - Continue nebulizers, serial VBGs to monitor resp status
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: hemodynamically stable at this time, pt has been
   adequately volume resuscitated as CVP ranging [**1-16**].
   - Echo neg for tamponade as above.
   - Control pain, fever
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not
   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to
   date, WBC WNL.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.
   - Finished 10 day course of empiric abx for PNA.
   Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that showed only 2
   WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr.  Skin exam not
   showing any break-down thus decub ulcer is not the source of fever. No
   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever low although in
   differential. With a feeding tube in place, may have occult sinusitis.
   High suspicion for ongoing aspiration given pt
s somewhat somnolent
   state and decreased ability to protect airways.
   - Nasal wash/ oral hygiene
   - consider thoracentesis.
   - pan-culture
   - continue antibiotics, and add cipro for now although unlikely
   resistant GNR at this time.
   - CT scan of head and torso for foci of infection
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever.
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, last echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   - Neuro following
   - Unclear if PO adequate at this time, and would consider IV
   supplementation if concern for absorption arises.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of
   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for
   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction
   and possible seizure.  given fevers would consider LP to evaluate for
   possible CNS infection.
   - Neurology recommended repeat LP on [**2191-3-31**]
   - Original CSF profile not c/w CNS infection
   - LFTs stable.
   - Start Lactulose/rifaxamin although as per liver unlikely cause for
   change in MS.
   - Continue keppra, check level
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Hct stable.
   - Check PM Hct
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - F/u Echo
   - Keep an active Type and cross
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Last INR 1.8, partly nutritional with question of
   underlying liver disease.  Was with etoh hepatitis earlier this admit.
   - Vit K given
   - Monitor LFT's
   - FFP PRN
   - follow Hct.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beri-beri, now transferred to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea. The patient has a large bilateral pleural effusion, likely due to heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process such as an empyema cannot be excluded. The patient is also suspected to have pulmonary aspiration pneumonia and a small pericardial effusion. He is currently being treated with antibiotics for empiric coverage, and a thoracentesis is planned for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The patient's fever persists despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and further investigations are needed to identify the source. Other ongoing issues include altered mental status, anemia, coagulopathy, and ethanol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's large bilateral pleural effusion may lead to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Infectious Complications: The presence of fever and ongoing infection despite antibiotic treatment suggests the possibility of an occult infectious process, such as an empyema or pneumonia. A thoracentesis will help determine the causative agent.
3. Cardiac Complications: The small pericardial effusion seen on echocardiogram raises concerns about cardiac tamponade, although the patient is hemodynamically stable at the moment.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status could"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a chief complaint of [complaint]. They have been in the ICU since [date] and have shown significant health progress. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 149/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and has a normal ABG result. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments. Lab results show an increase in white blood cell count, a decrease in hemoglobin concentration, and elevated levels of creatinine and lactate. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's dyspnea and patchy consolidations on the CT scan indicate respiratory distress. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid, resulting in a positive fluid balance. This may lead to pulmonary edema and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient's history and review of systems are unchanged from admission. 

The patient attempted to perform a negative inspiratory force (NIF) and vital capacity (VC) test but was unable to do so. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed normal sinuses without evidence of sinusitis. A CT scan of the torso revealed increased bilateral pleural effusion and patchy consolidations in the right upper lobe. An echocardiogram demonstrated normal systolic function, hyperdynamic ventricular function, and a small pericardial effusion. 

The patient has been diuresed with Lasix 40mg IV once, resulting in 1.5 liters of fluid output in three hours. The hematocrit (Hct) dropped to 21.6, prompting a transfusion of one packed red blood cell (pRBCs). The patient has been placed on nothing by mouth (NPO) status per speech therapy. An MRI brain with gadolinium was performed and showed a decrease in fluid collection without evidence of abscess. 

An infectious diseases (ID) consult was obtained, recommending thoracentesis, which will require fresh frozen plasma (FFP) depending on the international normalized ratio (INR). The patient's oxygen supplement has been weaned down to 4 liters nasal cannula with oxygen saturation ("

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea in setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: Pt has a large bilateral pleural effusion which is likely
   the main reason for tachypnea. This bilateral pleural effusion, which
   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to
   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process
   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.
   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although
   limited by motion.
   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage
   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small
   pericardial effusion.
   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component
   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.
   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle
   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)
 no definite
   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been
   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.
   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the
   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric
   coverage. Will need thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic
   purposes.
   - Continue nebulizers, serial VBGs to monitor resp status
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: hemodynamically stable at this time, pt has been
   adequately volume resuscitated as CVP ranging [**1-16**].
   - Echo neg for tamponade as above.
   - Control pain, fever
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not
   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to
   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that
   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No
   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in
   still differential.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.
   - Continue abx as above
   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was
   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis
   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT
   torso was obtained: limited by motion, spelnomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm
   fluid collection in stomach
   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen
   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: fluid collection actually
   smaller now; no abscess.
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Monitor pt
s ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status and extreme muscle weakness
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night. Was
   transfused 1 u pRBC
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of
   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for
   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction
   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not
   c/w CNS infection
   - LFTs stable.
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue keppra
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   - Neuro signed off
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease
   and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need FFP before thoracentesis to reverse coagulopathy.
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian (placed [**4-4**]), 2 peripherals

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea in setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: Pt has a large bilateral pleural effusion which is likely
   the main reason for tachypnea. This bilateral pleural effusion, which
   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to
   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process
   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.
   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although
   limited by motion.
   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage
   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small
   pericardial effusion.
   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component
   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.
   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle
   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)
 no definite
   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been
   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.
   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the
   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric
   coverage. Will need thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic
   purposes.
   - Continue nebulizers, serial VBGs to monitor resp status
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: hemodynamically stable at this time, pt has been
   adequately volume resuscitated as CVP ranging [**1-16**].
   - Echo neg for tamponade as above.
   - Control pain, fever
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not
   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to
   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that
   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No
   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in
   still differential.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.
   - Continue abx as above
   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was
   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis
   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT
   torso was obtained: limited by motion, spelnomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm
   fluid collection in stomach
   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen
   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: fluid collection actually
   smaller now; no abscess.
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Monitor pt
s ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status and extreme muscle weakness
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night. Was
   transfused 1 u pRBC
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of
   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for
   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction
   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not
   c/w CNS infection
   - LFTs stable.
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue keppra
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.
   .
   # Hyponatremia:
   - Unlikely hypovolemic hyponatremia as CVP ranging [**1-19**]. Hypervolemic
   hyponatremia is equally unlikely given that pt was actually diuresed
   overnight and pt wasn
t hyponatremic before.
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   - Neuro signed off
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease
   and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need FFP before thoracentesis to reverse coagulopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beri-beri, now admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea. He is being treated for aspiration pneumonia. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:
1. Tachypnea: The patient has a large bilateral pleural effusion, which is likely the main reason for tachypnea. This effusion may be due to heart failure from wet beri-beri or an occult infectious process such as empyema.
2. Suspicion of PE: A CT angiography (CTA) was done last night showing no PE, although limited by motion.
3. Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology: An echocardiogram (Echo) showed normal systolic function, hyperdynamic, and a small pericardial effusion.
4. NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component of tachypnea, but the patient was unable to tolerate it.
5. Trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken for gentle diuresis, and the patient responded with 1.5 L output in 3 hours. However, there was no definite evidence of improvement in respiratory status.

 no definite
   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been
   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.
   - Lasix x 1 again today for diuresis since pt is grossly volume
   overloaded
   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the
   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric
   coverage. Will need bilateral thoracentesis for diagnostic and
   therapeutic purposes. (Will give 2u FFP first to reverse coagulopathy)
   - Continue nebulizers PRN, serial VBGs to monitor resp status
   - Tachycardia likely related to underlying process of fever, infection.
   Hemodynamically stable currently.

   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not
   c/w CNS infection
   - LFTs stable.
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Check seizure history and indications for continuing Keppra.
   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting
   mental status
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beri-beri, now admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea in the setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a large bilateral pleural effusion, likely due to heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process such as an empyema cannot be excluded. There is also a suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology, but the echocardiogram showed normal systolic function and a small pericardial effusion. The patient attempted to undergo neuromuscular testing but was unable to tolerate it. The patient responded to a trial of diuresis with Lasix, resulting in 1.5 liters of output in 3 hours. The patient's Hct dropped to 21.6 and was transfused with 1 pRBC. The patient has been weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula and has been on nebulizers PRN. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient has a large bilateral pleural effusion, which is likely the main reason for tachypnea. This bilateral pleural effusion, which increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process such as an empyema cannot be excluded.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea in setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: Pt has a large bilateral pleural effusion which is likely
   the main reason for tachypnea. This bilateral pleural effusion, which
   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to
   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process
   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.
   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although
   limited by motion.
   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage
   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small
   pericardial effusion.
   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component
   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.
   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle
   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)
 no definite
   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been
   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.
   - Lasix x 1 again today for diuresis since pt is grossly volume
   overloaded
   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the
   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric
   coverage. Will need bilateral thoracentesis for diagnostic and
   therapeutic purposes. (Will give 2u FFP first to reverse coagulopathy)
   - Continue nebulizers PRN, serial VBGs to monitor resp status
   - Tachycardia likely related to underlying process of fever, infection.
   Hemodynamically stable currently.
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not
   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to
   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that
   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No
   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in
   still differential.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.
   - Continue abx as above
   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was
   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis
   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT
   torso was obtained: limited by motion, splenomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm
   fluid collection in stomach
 need to discuss what this is with
   radiology
   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen
   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: fluid collection actually
   smaller now; no abscess.
   - f/u final reads of imaging studies from yesterday
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Monitor pt
s ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status and extreme muscle weakness
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever.
   - F/u ID recs
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night and
   was transfused 1 u pRBC.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - Change PPI from Qday to [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of
   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for
   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction
   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not
   c/w CNS infection
   - LFTs stable.
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Check seizure history and indications for continuing Keppra.
   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting
   mental status
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.
   .
   # Hyponatremia:
   - Unlikely hypovolemic hyponatremia as CVP ranging [**1-19**]. Hypervolemic
   hyponatremia is equally unlikely given that pt was actually diuresed
   overnight and pt wasn
t hyponatremic before.
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - Check TSH and Cortisol
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   - Neuro signed off
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease
   and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need FFP before thoracentesis to reverse coagulopathy.
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian (placed [**4-4**]), 2 peripherals
   .
   # Code: presumed full
   .
   # Communication: Patient/ Parents; Will discuss today

   thoracentesis with parents who will be visiting the patient today.

   MRI head [**4-4**] Final read
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Small subdural collection along the left convexity has decreased in
   size,
   but increased in complexity and viscosity. Evaluation for associated
   contrast
   enhancement is technically limited.
   2. New nonspecific signal abnormality in the central pons, which may
   represent a subacute infarction or central pontine myelinolysis.
   Infectious
   and inflammatory causes should also be considered. The location of this
   lesion does not correspond to typical or atypical manifestations of
   Wernicke
   encephalopathy.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea in setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: Pt has a large bilateral pleural effusion which is likely
   the main reason for tachypnea. Tachycardia likely related to underlying
   process of fever, infection. Hemodynamically stable currently.  Pleural
   effusion was drained yesterday. (2L total bilaterally)
   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far)
   **Investigation for other possible etiology of tachypnea/ tachycardia
   so far:
   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done
 no PE, although limited by motion.
   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage
   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small
   pericardial effusion.
   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component
   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not
   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to
   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that
   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No
   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in
   still differential.
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was
   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis
   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT
   torso was obtained: limited by motion, splenomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm
   fluid collection in stomach ->> cannot be drained by IR (too risky due
   to other overlying structures); will do an U/S and do a diagnostic para
   if there is any ascites.
   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen
   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: not abscess; but there is a
   new nonspecific lesion in pons that is c/w central pontine myelinolysis
   or subacute infarction
 MRA of brain ordered.
   - f/u pleural fluid labs
   - Continue Vanc, Zosyn and Cipro (for PNA/ also gives good CNS coverage
   if + brain abscess)- On day 12 of 14 today
   - f/u final reads of imaging studies from [**4-4**]
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Monitor pt
s ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status and extreme muscle weakness
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night and
   was transfused 1 u pRBC.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of
   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for
   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction
   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not
   c/w CNS infection
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - LFTs stable.
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuro
   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting
   mental status
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.
   .
   # Hyponatremia:
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - TSH WNL
   - Cortisol indeterminate; will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease
   and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT consult placed; try to get pt OOB

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,
   weakness, HAP readmitted with fevers and tachypnea. B thoracenteses
   yesterday, transudates. MRI with abnormality in pons, f/u MRI read
   pending.
   Exam notable for Tm 103.1 BP 120/70 HR 120-130 RR 28-32 with sat 97 on
   4LNC. CVP 12-15. Frail, dysarthric man, denies pain though speech is
   difficult to understand. CTA B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 23, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.6. CXR with low
   volumes, R effusion, interstitial prominence.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic
   coverage x 14 days (day 12 today) for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia,
   supplemental oxygen, and gentle diuresis given effusions and elevated
   CVP. For fevers, will f/u CT reads w/r/t peripancreatic collection and
   discuss fluid sampling with ID and IR; will also check USG for ?

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beriberi, now admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia/dyspnea in the setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia. He has a large bilateral pleural effusion, likely the main reason for tachypnea. The patient's tachycardia is likely related to an underlying process of fever and infection. He is hemodynamically stable currently. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient has a large bilateral pleural effusion, which is likely the main reason for his tachypnea.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to an underlying process of fever and infection.
3. Anemia: The patient has multiple reasons to be anemic, including malnutrition, illness, and guaiac positive stools.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing a current deterioration in setting of respiratory distress and fever. The impression on the floor was for multifactorial etiology, including beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction, and possible seizure.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which could be due to SIADH secondary to pulmonary processes.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 2.1, likely due to alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition.
7. Etoh Withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is at risk for withdrawal.
8. Beriberi: The patient has signs of wet beriberi, which is a deficiency of thiamine.
9. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for aspiration pneumonia.
10. Possible Central Nervous System Infection: The MRI showed a new nonspecific lesion in the pons, which could be consistent with central pontine myelinolysis or subacute infarction."

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,
   weakness, HAP readmitted with fevers and tachypnea. B thoracenteses
   yesterday, transudates. MRI with abnormality in pons, f/u MRI read
   pending.
   Exam notable for Tm 103.1 BP 120/70 HR 120-130 RR 28-32 with sat 97 on
   4LNC. CVP 12-15. Frail, dysarthric man, denies pain though speech is
   difficult to understand. CTA B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 23, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.6. CXR with low
   volumes, R effusion, interstitial prominence.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic
   coverage x 14 days (day 12 today) for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia,
   supplemental oxygen, and gentle diuresis given effusions and elevated
   CVP. For fevers, will f/u CT reads w/r/t peripancreatic collection and
   discuss fluid sampling with ID and IR; will also check USG for ?
   ascites. Will hold off on drainage of intracranial collection, and will
   f/u repeat MRI re pons lesion. Continue thamine for beriberi as well as
   nutritional support via NGT and check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for low sodium and
   latered mental status. Mental status and strength somewhat better
   today, consult PT, OOB. For anemia, likely combination of slow GIB and
   critical illness. Will continue to follow serial HCT and maintain HCT
   >21. Continue PNBTS, PPI [**Hospital1 7**]. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and severe thiamine deficiency. He was readmitted to the ICU with fevers and tachypnea. The patient underwent two thoracenteses yesterday, which revealed transudates. An MRI showed an abnormality in the pons, and follow-up MRI results are pending. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.1°F, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 120-130 bpm, respiratory rate of 28-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 4LNC. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 12-15 mmHg. He is described as a frail, dysarthric man who denies pain but has difficulty understanding speech. Cardiac examination reveals regular rhythm with S1 and S2 sounds, and soft +BS (heart sounds). There is also evidence of 1+ edema. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7K, hematocrit of 23, potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. The chest X-ray shows low volumes, right-sided effusion, and interstitial prominence.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea in setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: Pt has a large bilateral pleural effusion which is likely
   the main reason for tachypnea. Tachycardia likely related to underlying
   process of fever, infection. Hemodynamically stable currently.  Pleural
   effusion was drained yesterday. (2L total bilaterally)
   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far)
   **Investigation for other possible etiology of tachypnea/ tachycardia
   so far:
   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done
 no PE, although limited by motion.
   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage
   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small
   pericardial effusion.
   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component
   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not
   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to
   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that
   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No
   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in
   still differential.
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was
   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis
   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT
   torso was obtained: limited by motion, splenomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm
   fluid collection in stomach ->> cannot be drained by IR (too risky due
   to other overlying structures); will do an U/S and do a diagnostic para

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,
   weakness, HAP readmitted with fevers and tachypnea. B thoracenteses
   yesterday, transudates. MRI with abnormality in pons, f/u MRI read
   pending.

   difficult to understand. CTA B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 23, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.6. CXR with low
   volumes, R effusion, interstitial prominence.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic
   coverage x 14 days (day 12 today) for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia,
   supplemental oxygen, and gentle diuresis given effusions and elevated
   CVP. For fevers, will f/u CT reads w/r/t peripancreatic collection and
   discuss fluid sampling with ID and IR; will also check USG for ?
   ascites. Will hold off on drainage of intracranial collection, and will
   f/u repeat MRI re pons lesion. Continue thamine for beriberi as well as
   nutritional support via NGT and check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for low sodium and
   latered mental status. Mental status and strength somewhat better
   today, consult PT, OOB. For anemia, likely combination of slow GIB and
   critical illness. Will continue to follow serial HCT and maintain HCT
   >21. Continue PNBTS, PPI [**Hospital1 7**]. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beriberi, now admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea in the setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a large bilateral pleural effusion, which is likely the main reason for tachypnea. Tachycardia is likely related to underlying infection and fever. The patient is hemodynamically stable. Pleural effusion was drained yesterday, and follow-up pleural fluid labs are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient's tachypnea is likely due to a large bilateral pleural effusion. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the effusion and manage it accordingly.
2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Investigation for the source of infection is ongoing, including suspicion of occult sinusitis, infectious processes in the lungs and abdomen, and brain infection.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's current deterioration in setting of respiratory distress and fever may be multifactorial, including beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction, and possible seizure. Monitoring and evaluation by neurorecs are recommended.
4. Anemia: The patient has multiple reasons to be anemic, including malnutrition, illness, and guaiac-positive stools. Close monitoring of Hct levels and transfusion as needed.

   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is increased pulmonary
   vascular congestion in a bat-[**Doctor First Name **] pattern. Due to differences in
   patient
   position, it is difficult to evaluate for re-accumulation of pleural
   fluid.
   The left hemidiaphragm is not seen sharply, consistent with some fluid
   on this
   side. The degree of diffuse opacification on the right is somewhat
   similar to
   the previous study.
   MRA brain [**4-6**]
   IMPRESSION: Apparent short-segment stenosis in the distal right
   vertebral
   artery, immediately proximal to the basilar artery origin, which may be
   artifactual. The basilar artery and other major intracranial arteries
   appear
   patent.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea, persistent fevers in setting of treatment for
   aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: Pt has a moderate bilateral pleural effusion which is
   likely the main reason for tachypnea. Tachycardia likely related to
   underlying process of fever, infection. Hemodynamically stable
   currently.
   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far, cultures NGTD)
   - Infection work up as below
   - O2 supplement
   - monitor closely, check VBG to check if pt is tiring
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage.
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - C. diff neg x 1, another sample pending
   - fluid collection in stomach, however not amenable to drainage due to
   location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   hold off on working it up further
   - f/u pleural fluid labs
   - Consider d/c all abx as pt continues to be febrile despite the broad
   spectrum abx
 ? drug fever
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Monitor pt
s ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status and extreme muscle weakness
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; unlikely since MRI brain did not show any bilateral
   hypothalamic lesions.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 delirium from current
   acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction and central pontine
   myelinolysis.
   - central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is okay,
   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate neuron recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuron for question of seizure
   activity on the floor
   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting
   mental status
   .
   # Hyponatremia: stable in low 130s.
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beriberi, currently admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia, dyspnea, and persistent fevers in the setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Tachypnea: The patient is experiencing moderate bilateral pleural effusion, which is likely the main reason for tachypnea. Tachycardia is also likely related to the underlying process of fever and infection. Hemodynamic stability is currently maintained.

2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Investigation for infection sources should continue, including follow-up pleural fluid labs, monitoring for drug fever, and considering discontinuation of all antibiotics if the patient remains febrile.

3. Anemia: The patient has multiple reasons to be anemic, including malnutrition, illness, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Maintaining a hemoglobin concentration above 21 is recommended, along with keeping an active type and cross.

4. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits altered mental status with delirium caused by current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction, and central pontine myelinolysis. Appropriate measures should be taken to address these factors, including simplifying medication lists to minimize the chance of medications affecting mental status.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with beriberi now with prolonged ICU course complicated by
   persistent fever and tachycardia.  His source remains to be defined
   with investigations to date unrevealing---of some concern his WBC count
   has shown a mild trend to increase over time.  The only localizing
   findings today would suggest possible increase in ronchi on lung exam.
   In addition
patient has worsening cough over past two days.  In
   addition he has evolution of bilateral patchy opacities consistent with
   parenchymal infiltrates that have progressed.  Differential diagnosis
   is extensive still but I would add
Oraganizing pneumonitis,
   eosinophillic pneumonia and possible alveolar hemorrhage are all
   consistent with parts of the current clinical course or persistent
   dyspnea and worsening infiltrates on antibiotics.
   Fever-If we look to pulmonary source as possible source of persistent
   fevers in the setting of worsening infiltrates.  It is difficult to say
   with certainty that antibiotics are aiding in course and would argue
   that current course of >10 days antibiotics has been reasonable course.
   -Would pursue fungal cultures/viral cultures
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro to D/C today
   -Tylenol 500mg q 4 hours
   -Will need to consider CT following trial of Lasix to treat any
   component of hydrostatic edeam.  [**Month (only) 51**] need to consider bronch for EOS or

","The patient presents with beriberi, an unknown fever origin, and a prolonged ICU course. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and a mild fever. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the right base and rhonchi bilaterally. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows mild increase in left-sided effusion.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Organizing pneumonia: The patient's worsening cough and bilateral patchy opacities consistent with parenchymal infiltrates suggest this possibility.
2. Eosinophilic pneumonia: This could be considered due to the presence of eosinophils in the differential count and the patient's respiratory symptoms.
3. Alveolar hemorrhage: The worsening infiltrates and persistent dyspnea may indicate this complication.
4. Thiamine deficiency: Given the patient's diagnosis of beriberi, thiamine deficiency is a potential concern.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired balance, muscle performance, motor function, posture, ventilation, and cough, indicating possible compromised skin integrity.
6. Delirium: Although the patient is responsive and appropriate today, altered mental status is present, which needs to be monitored closely.

These potential complications should be further evaluated and managed accordingly to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea, persistent fevers in setting of treatment for
   aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea: Pt has a moderate bilateral pleural effusion which is
   likely the main reason for tachypnea. Tachycardia likely related to
   underlying process of fever, infection. Hemodynamically stable
   currently.
   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far, cultures NGTD)
   - Infection work up as below
   - Intubated [**4-7**] for resp distress, worsening ABG c/w fatigue
   - BAL for worsening Chest CT findings
 F/U results
 if pos for
   hemosiderin-laden Macros, then check ANCA, anti-basement membrane
   - Attempt PSV/CPAP, wean sedation for NIF trial, keep TV low (400cc)
   for poss ARDS
   - Hold Tylenol
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Now
   afebrile off all ATBx could represent drug fever
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - C. diff neg x 2
   - fluid collection in stomach, however not amenable to drainage due to
   location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   hold off on working it up further
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - D/c all antibiotics for ? drug fever
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; unlikely since MRI brain did not show any bilateral
   hypothalamic lesions, lesss likely
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 delirium from current
   acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction and central pontine
   myelinolysis.
   - central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is okay,
   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate neuron recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuron for question of seizure
   activity on the floor
   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting
   mental status
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Was stable in low 130s. Now improving to mid-130s
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian (placed [**4-4**]), A-line

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea. The patient has a history of wet beriberi and was being treated for aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient's current condition includes worsening bilateral symmetrical mostly perihilar consolidation in both upper lobes and right middle lobe, likely due to pulmonary edema. There is also extensive consolidation within both lower lobes, which could potentially reflect developing ARDS. Multifocal rapidly progressing multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage are also in the differential.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 113/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a moderate bilateral pleural effusion, which is likely the main reason for tachypnea. The tachycardia is likely related to the underlying process of fever and infection. The patient's hemodynamics are currently stable.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.7 K/uL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The extensive consolidation within both lower lobes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with worsening bilateral symmetrical consolidation in both upper lobes and right middle lobe, likely due to pulmonary edema. There is also extensive consolidation within both lower lobes, which could potentially reflect developing ARDS. Multifocal rapidly progressing multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage are also in the differential.

The patient has been intubated for respiratory distress and bronchoscopy. BAL from the right upper and middle lobes shows cloudy & pink fluid, sent for cell count, cytology, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and infectious workup.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39°C (102.2°F), heart rate of 99 bpm (with range of 99-130 bpm), blood pressure of 113/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (with range of 15-48 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, and other medications as per the ICU protocol.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient has several:

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 39°C (102.2°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 113/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been intubated for respiratory distress and bronchoscopy. An arterial line has been placed in the right radial artery. The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions for sedation. Pantoprazole (Protonix) and furosemide (Lasix) were given on the previous day. Heparin sodium is being administered as prophylaxis.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of +1,020 mL since midnight, with intake of 2,227 mL and output of 1,207 mL. The patient's urine output is 1,007 mL, and the NG tube is draining dark brown liquid stools.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea, persistent fevers in setting of treatment for
   aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF this
   am, however, he appears to be more weak peripherally and concern that
   if he were extubated he would tire quickly and require reintubation.
   CXR is somewhat improved this morning and bilateral pleural effusions
   appear improved.   No evidence of underlying infection currently and
   pleural fluid from thoracentesis was transudative.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be a
   central component.
   - BAL for worsening Chest CT findings
 F/U results
 if pos for
   hemosiderin-laden Macros, then check ANCA, anti-basement membrane:
   pathology still pending.  ANCA and anti-GBM ordered and results
   pending.
   - Attempt PSV/CPAP, wean sedation for NIF trial, keep TV low (400cc)
   for poss ARDS
   - Hold Tylenol
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive.  Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion,
   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction and
   possible central pontine myelinolysis.
   - central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is okay,
   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate neuron recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuron for question of seizure
   activity on the floor
   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting
   mental status
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Now afebrile off all antibiotics,
   could represent drug fever
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - C. diff neg x 2
   - fluid collection in stomach, however not amenable to drainage due to
   location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   hold off on working it up further
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - will check respiratory virus screen.
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; unlikely since MRI brain did not show any bilateral
   hypothalamic lesions, less likely
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been
   stable over the last several days.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Was stable in low 130s. Now improving to mid-130s
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.  Lasix 40 mg IV x 1
   given 2L positive yesterday.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beri-beri who was admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia/dyspnea and persistent fevers in the setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated and sedated, with good respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) and negative inspiratory force (NIF). However, the patient appears weak peripherally, and there is concern that if extubated, he would tire quickly and require reintubation.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and mild hypotension. The patient's fever has improved since the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, hyponatremia, and coagulopathy. The patient has multiple reasons to be anemic, including malnutrition, illness, and guaiac-positive stools suggesting a slow gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's hyponatremia is improving and is likely due to SIADH related to pulmonary processes. The patient's coagulopathy is attributed to alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition.

The patient has been diagnosed with wet beri-beri and is receiving"

   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea, persistent fevers in setting of treatment for
   aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF this
   am, however, he appears to be more weak peripherally and concern that
   if he were extubated he would tire quickly and require reintubation.
   CXR is somewhat improved this morning and bilateral pleural effusions
   appear improved.   No evidence of underlying infection currently and
   pleural fluid from thoracentesis was transudative.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be a
   central component.
   - BAL for worsening Chest CT findings
 F/U results
 if pos for
   hemosiderin-laden Macros, then check ANCA, anti-basement membrane:
   pathology still pending.  ANCA and anti-GBM ordered and results
   pending.
   - Attempt PSV/CPAP, wean sedation for NIF trial, keep TV low (400cc)
   for poss ARDS
   - Hold Tylenol
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive.  Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion,
   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction and
   possible central pontine myelinolysis.
   - central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is okay,
   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate neuron recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuron for question of seizure
   activity on the floor
   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting
   mental status
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Now
   afebrile off all antibiotics, could represent drug fever
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - C. diff neg x 2
   - fluid collection in stomach, however not amenable to drainage due to
   location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   hold off on working it up further
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - will check respiratory virus screen.
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; unlikely since MRI brain did not show any bilateral
   hypothalamic lesions, less likely
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been
   stable over the last several days.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Was stable in low 130s. Now improving to mid-130s
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH ingestion, presenting with respiratory distress, tachycardia, altered mental status, fevers, anemia, hyponatremia, and signs of wet beri-beri. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia/dyspnea, persistent fevers in the setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia. He is currently intubated and sedated, with good RSBI and NIF. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/72 to 147/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals cachexia, poor dentition, NG tube, ETT, tachycardia, hyperdynamic cardiovascular system, tachypnea, coarse upper airway sounds, rales bilaterally, 2+ edema in dependent areas, and opens eyes to voice.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beriberi, now admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea. He has persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. The patient is intubated for respiratory distress and has worsening ABG consistent with fatigue. He has a moderate bilateral pleural effusion, likely the main cause of tachypnea. Tachycardia is likely related to underlying infection. The patient is hemodynamically stable currently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers despite antibiotic treatment, suggesting a possible ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Drug fever: The patient is currently afebrile off all antibiotics, which could indicate a drug fever. All antibiotics should be discontinued to determine if the fever is related to medication.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a moderate bilateral pleural effusion, which may contribute to respiratory distress and tachypnea. Further evaluation of pleural fluid labs is needed.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a coagulation disorder. This is likely due to alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vitamin K has been given during this admission, and the patient will require vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma before procedures to reverse coagulopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute
   tachycardia/dyspnea, persistent fevers in setting of treatment for
   aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Pt has a moderate bilateral pleural
   effusion which is likely the main reason for tachypnea. Tachycardia
   likely related to underlying process of fever, infection.
   Hemodynamically stable currently.
   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far, cultures NGTD)
   - Infection work up as below
   - Intubated [**4-7**] for resp distress, worsening ABG c/w fatigue
   - BAL for worsening Chest CT findings
 F/U results
 if pos for
   hemosiderin-laden Macros, then check ANCA, anti-basement membrane
   - Attempt PSV/CPAP, wean sedation for NIF trial, keep TV low (400cc)
   for poss ARDS
   - Hold Tylenol
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Now
   afebrile off all ATBx could represent drug fever
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - C. diff neg x 2
   - fluid collection in stomach, however not amenable to drainage due to
   location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   hold off on working it up further
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - D/c all antibiotics for ? drug fever
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; unlikely since MRI brain did not show any bilateral
   hypothalamic lesions, lesss likely
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 delirium from current
   acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction and central pontine
   myelinolysis.
   - central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is okay,
   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate neuron recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuron for question of seizure
   activity on the floor
   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting
   mental status
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Was stable in low 130s. Now improving to mid-130s
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.

   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF this
   am, however, he appears to be more weak peripherally and concern that
   if he were extubated he would tire quickly and require reintubation.
   CXR is somewhat improved this morning and bilateral pleural effusions
   appear improved.   No evidence of underlying infection currently and
   pleural fluid from thoracentesis was transudative.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be a
   central component.
   - BAL for worsening Chest CT findings
 F/U results
 if pos for
   hemosiderin-laden Macros, then check ANCA, anti-basement membrane:
   pathology still pending.  ANCA and anti-GBM ordered and results
   pending.
   - Attempt PSV/CPAP, wean sedation for NIF trial, keep TV low (400cc)
   for poss ARDS
   - Hold Tylenol

   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive.  Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion,
   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction and
   possible central pontine myelinolysis.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beriberi who has been admitted to the ICU for acute tachycardia and dyspnea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/80 mmHg to 109/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, and abnormal liver function tests.

The assessment and plan section of the note highlights several potential medical complications that the patient may face, including tachypnea/respiratory distress, tachycardia, altered mental status, fevers, anemia, hyponatremia, beriberi, coagulopathy, ethanol withdrawal, and electrolyte imbalances.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's wet beriberi condition can lead to cardiovascular issues such as high-output heart failure. The patient's tachycardia and hyperdynamic cardiovascular examination suggest ongoing cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's altered mental status may be due to multiple etiologies, including chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from acute illness and ICU setting, liver dysfunction, and possible central pontine"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fevers
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF
   yesterday however extubation was not attempted due to pt
s profound
   muscle weakness and concern that he may tire quickly and require
   re-intubation.
   - Consider transition directly to trach/PEG. Will discuss this with
   pt
s parents first.
   - BAL done for worsening Chest CT findings
 F/U results
 if pos for
   hemosiderin-laden Macros, then check ANCA, anti-basement membrane:
   pathology still pending.  ANCA and anti-GBM ordered and results
   pending.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive.  Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion,
   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction,
   dry beri beri and central pontine myelinolysis.
   - central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is okay,
   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate neuron recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs re: prognosis for cognitive recovery, any other
   necessary tests for work up, and the use of zyprexa for discomfort and
   agitation
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuron for question of seizure
   activity earlier in admission
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Now afebrile off all antibiotics,
   could represent drug fever
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Bronch
 BAL so far unrevealing. F/u on outstanding studies.
   - C. diff neg x 2
   - fluid collection in stomach seen on imaging, however not amenable to
   drainage due to location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   hold off on working it up further
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - Consider paracentesis, although not much ascitic fluid seen by U/S.
   ([**Month (only) 51**] need IR for this)
   - RSV neg
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did not show any
   bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in differential.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been
   stable over the last several days.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Was stable in low 130s. Now improving to mid-130s
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue thiamine repletion
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.  Lasix 40 mg IV x 1
   given 2L positive yesterday.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian (placed [**4-4**]), A-line
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Patient/ Parents; need to discuss prognosis and
   transition to Trach/PEG if desired.
   .
   # Disposition: Pending above; contact IP if pt will transition to
   Trach/PEG. Once Trach/PEG in place, ask case management to start
   screening for placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beriberi, presenting with persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fevers. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's condition includes muscle weakness, altered mental status, and anemia. He has a history of chronic EtOH ingestion and possible central pontine myelinolysis. The patient's labs show elevated WBC, Hct, and various electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies have been performed, and further investigations are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea/Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and extubation may not be attempted due to profound muscle weakness. Consideration should be given to transition to tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) if desired by the patient's parents.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is not fluid responsive and is likely related to fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's heart rate is necessary.

3. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits multiple etiologies for altered mental status, including chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from acute illness and ICU setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri, and central pontine myelinolysis. Minimize sedating medications, consider zyprexa for delirium,"

 F/U results
 if pos for
   hemosiderin-laden Macros, pathology still pending.  ANCA and anti-GBM
   ordered and results pending.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive.  Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion,
   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction,
   dry beri beri and central pontine myelinolysis.
   - central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is okay,
   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs re: prognosis for cognitive recovery, any other
   necessary tests for work up, and the use of zyprexa for discomfort and
   agitation
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with Neuro for question of seizure
   activity earlier in admission
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Was afebrile off all antibiotics,
   which could represent drug fever, but now T max 100.5F [**4-11**]
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Bronch
 BAL so far unrevealing. F/u on outstanding studies.
   - C. diff neg x 2
   - fluid collection in stomach seen on imaging, however not amenable to
   drainage due to location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   hold off on working it up further
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - Consider paracentesis, although not much ascitic fluid seen by U/S.
   ([**Month (only) 51**] need IR for this)
   - RSV neg
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did not show any
   bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in differential.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been
   stable over the last several days.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Was stable in low 130s. Now improving to mid-130s
   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will
   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water
   restriction.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy (2U
   FFP today [**4-11**] prior to trach/PEG)
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beriberi, currently in the ICU for persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fevers. The patient has a history of chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from acute illness and ICU setting, liver dysfunction, dry beriberi, and central pontine myelinolysis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/65 mmHg to 173/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient has a rash with raised, blanchable lesions on the trunk and extremities, and is hypertensive with systolic readings in the 140s-150s. The patient has been NPO since midnight and will require 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) on call to IP. The patient has multiple medical complications including tachypnea, respiratory distress, tachycardia, altered mental status, anemia, hyponatremia, dry beri beri, coagulopathy, and rash. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.7, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient has been receiving various medications including pantoprazole, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's recent imaging studies show a fluid collection in the stomach and extra-axially on MRI brain, but no abscess or pleural effusion. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte imbalances, and deep vein thrombosis."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beri-beri who was transferred to the ICU for persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fevers. He has been intubated due to profound muscle weakness and concerns about extubation failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including tachypnea, respiratory distress, tachycardia, altered mental status, and fevers. He also has anemia, hyponatremia, dry beri beri, coagulopathy, and a rash. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.5°F, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/65 mmHg to 173/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tachypnea/Respiratory Distress: The patient has persistent tachypnea and respiratory distress despite having good respiratory system compliance and negative inspiratory force. This may indicate underlying lung pathology or inadequate ventilatory support.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, which could be related to fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central nervous system disease. It is important to monitor and manage his heart rate to prevent complications such as arrhythmias.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has multiple etiologies for altered mental status including"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a cachectic adult who is currently intubated and alert. They have a history of respiratory failure, impaired airway clearance, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/65 mmHg to 173/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, fentanyl, and heparin sodium. They have multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures should be done to identify early signs of infection.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and heparin should be implemented to prevent clot formation.

3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers, which may result in gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is receiving pantoprazole to reduce this risk. Regular monitoring of gastric pH and symptoms"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but the note highlights several significant events and issues.

Firstly, the patient's parents have agreed to a tracheostomy (Trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, which indicates the severity of the patient's condition and the need for long-term airway and nutritional support.

Secondly, the patient has developed a new rash characterized by slightly raised blanchable punctate lesions on the trunk and extremities. This rash is likely an early drug rash, and the physician is monitoring for systemic symptoms or new mucosal lesions.

Thirdly, the patient's blood pressure has been elevated in the 140s-150s systolic range, and the physician has started captopril to address this issue. The need for an increased dose suggests ongoing hypertension management.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), which indicates a fever. The heart rate is elevated at 116 bpm, likely due to the patient's critical condition. Blood pressure readings are within the hypertensive range, respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is 94%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, which is within the normal range. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,781 mL, output"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fevers
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF over
   weekend however extubation was not attempted due to pt
s profound
   muscle weakness and concern that he may tire quickly and require
   re-intubation.  Trach placed [**4-11**].
   - Will attempt trach mask trial
   - Still awaiting BAL results (if pos for hemosiderin-laden Macros,
   pathology still pending).  ANCA and anti-GBM ordered and results
   pending.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Also starting to become
   hypertensive.
   - stop captopril due to propensity to cause rashes
   - start metoprolol 12.5 mg TID and titrate upward as necessary
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion,
   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction,
   dry beri beri and central pontine myelinolysis.
   - potential central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is
   okay, ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs re: prognosis for cognitive recovery, any other
   necessary tests for work up, and the use of zyprexa for discomfort and
   agitation
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash
 f/u with Neuro
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem) and was less febrile off all
   antibiotics.  Fever last night could represent drug fever.  ID has
   signed off, but will let them know that he is still spiking fevers.
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Bronch
 BAL so far unrevealing. F/u on outstanding studies.
   - C. diff neg multiple times
   - fluid collection in stomach seen on imaging, however not amenable to
   drainage due to location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   repeat MRI [**4-12**]
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - Consider paracentesis, although not much ascitic fluid seen by U/S.
   ([**Month (only) 51**] need IR for this)
   - RSV neg
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did not show any
   bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in differential.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been
   stable over the last several days.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid
   140s.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy (2U
   FFP [**4-11**] prior to trach/PEG)
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]
   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement
   - Keppra and captopril stopped
 f/u with Neuro
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian removed (placed [**4-4**]), A-line, peripheral,
   PICC to be placed
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Patient/ Parents.
   .
   # Disposition: Once Trach/PEG in place, ask case management to start
   screening for placement.
   - Family would like the patient to go to [**Hospital 189**] Rehab once medically
   ready.
   - Need to ask SW or case management to help file long-term disability
   papers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH ingestion, who presented with wet beri-beri and is now in the ICU for persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fevers. He has been intubated due to muscle weakness and concerns about potential extubation failure. A tracheostomy was performed on [**2191-4-11**]. The patient has a morbilliform rash, and Keppra was discontinued as a potential cause. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics but continues to have fevers. Other medical issues include altered mental status with multiple etiologies, anemia, hyponatremia, dry/wet beri beri, coagulopathy, and ethanol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's tachypnea and respiratory distress require close monitoring and ongoing respiratory support. The recent placement of a tracheostomy should help improve ventilation and oxygenation.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be related to fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central nervous system disease. Close monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is essential.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has multiple factors contributing to his altered mental status, including chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from acute illness and ICU setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri, and central pontine myelinolysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol use, presenting with symptoms of wet beri-beri, persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fevers. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress and has been intubated. The patient has multiple comorbidities including anemia, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and a drug rash. His mental status is altered due to a combination of factors such as chronic alcohol use, delirium, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri, and central pontine myelinolysis. The patient has a history of EtOH ingestion and has been diagnosed with central pontine myelinolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. There is a risk of respiratory failure and the need for increased ventilatory support.

2. Infection: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient continues to have fevers. There is a possibility of a hospital-acquired infection or a persistent underlying infection that has not been identified yet. This could lead to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiomyopathy or underlying central nervous system disease. Close monitoring is required to prevent cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

4. Altered Mental Status:"

The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers and a rash, which the ID physician believes to be drug fever. Physical examination reveals sinus tachycardia and impaired neurological function. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is responding well to tracheostomy trials. MRI head has been performed. 

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), current temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate ranging from 112 to 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/82 to 176/101 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 21 to 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,340 mL and total output of 805 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving nutrition via a feeding tube and has an arterial line in place. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, altered mental status, impaired airway clearance, balance, muscle performance, motor function, posture, ventilation, and impaired cough.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fevers
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF over
   weekend however extubation was not attempted due to pt
s profound
   muscle weakness and concern that he may tire quickly and require
   re-intubation.  Trach placed [**4-11**].
   - Will attempt trach mask trial
   - Still awaiting BAL results (if pos for hemosiderin-laden Macros,
   pathology still pending).  ANCA and anti-GBM ordered and results
   pending.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Also starting to become
   hypertensive.
   - stop captopril due to propensity to cause rashes
   - start metoprolol 12.5 mg TID and titrate upward as necessary
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion,
   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction,
   dry beri beri and central pontine myelinolysis.
   - potential central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is
   okay, ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of
   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it
   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs re: prognosis for cognitive recovery, any other
   necessary tests for work up, and the use of zyprexa for discomfort and
   agitation
   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash
 f/u with Neuro
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem) and was less febrile off all
   antibiotics.  Fever last night could represent drug fever.  ID has
   signed off, but will let them know that he is still spiking fevers.
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Bronch
 BAL so far unrevealing. F/u on outstanding studies.
   - C. diff neg multiple times
   - fluid collection in stomach seen on imaging, however not amenable to
   drainage due to location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   repeat MRI [**4-12**]
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for
   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.
   - Consider paracentesis, although not much ascitic fluid seen by U/S.
   ([**Month (only) 51**] need IR for this)
   - RSV neg
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
s a diagnosis of
   exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did not show any
   bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in differential.
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been
   stable over the last several days.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid
   140s.
   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy (2U
   FFP [**4-11**] prior to trach/PEG)
   - follow Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]
   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement
   - Keppra and captopril stopped
 f/u with Neuro
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian removed (placed [**4-4**]), A-line, peripheral,
   PICC to be placed
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Patient/ Parents.
   .
   # Disposition: Once Trach/PEG in place, ask case management to start
   screening for placement.
   - Family would like the patient to go to [**Hospital 189**] Rehab once medically
   ready.
   - Need to ask SW or case management to help file long-term disability
   papers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH ingestion, presenting with wet beri-beri, persistent tachycardia/dyspnea, and fevers. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and muscle weakness. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is experiencing multiple complications including tachypnea, altered mental status, tachycardia, anemia, hyponatremia, dry beri beri, coagulopathy, and a morbilliform rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and muscle weakness may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The persistent fevers and positive blood cultures could indicate an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis.
3. Delirium: The altered mental status, along with the use of sedating medications, could contribute to delirium.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The tachycardia and hyperdynamic circulation suggest cardiomyopathy, which may be related to the patient's underlying central nervous system disease.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The guaiac positive stools indicate possible gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to anemia.
6. Hyponatremia: The previous episode of hyponatremia requires close monitoring for any signs of neurological complications.
7. Coagulopathy: The elevated INR indicates a bleeding risk"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beriberi, who has been transferred to the ICU for persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate 112 bpm, blood pressure 155/82 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a cachectic appearance, alert mental status, poor dentition, nasal gastric tube, tracheostomy tube in place, coarse upper airway sounds, rales bilaterally, occasional cough, soft non-tender abdomen, 2+ dependent edema, and a morbilliform rash more confluent.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.7 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL, sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 4.0 mEq/L, chloride 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate 28 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 24.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, glucose 119 mg/dL, and a rash.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including tachypnea, respiratory distress, tachycardia, altered mental status, fevers, anemia, hyponatremia, dry beriberi, coagulopathy, and rash. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, sepsis due to persistent fevers, further deterioration of mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular instability."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fever unknown origin
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF over
   weekend however extubation was not attempted due to pt
s profound
   muscle weakness and concern that he may tire quickly and require
   re-intubation.  Trach placed [**4-11**].
   - Cont trach mask
   - BAL results (neg for hemosiderin-laden Macros).  ANCA negand anti-GBM
   remains pending, but not likely to be positive.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Is staying
   normotensive.
   - Captopril d/c
d due to propensity to cause rashes
   - Increase metoprolol to 25 mg TID and titrate upward as necessary
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Appears to be improving. Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from current acute illness, ICU
   setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri and central pontine
   myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. Repeat MRI shows unchanged small
   subdural defect and continued evolution of likely central pontine
   myelinolysis. Likely due to fast correction of hyponatremia on
   admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH ingestion, presenting with symptoms of wet beriberi, persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fever of unknown origin. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management. He has been diagnosed with central pontine myelinolysis on MRI brain and is suspected to have delirium due to multiple etiologies including chronic EtOH ingestion, current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction, and dry beriberi. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. He is also experiencing anemia, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, rash, and has a history of ethanol withdrawal. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to the need for re-intubation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may persist or worsen, potentially indicating cardiomyopathy or underlying central disease.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may progress or fluctuate, requiring ongoing assessment and management.
4. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and positive cultures for yeast suggest a possible ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and guide appropriate treatment.

   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF over
   weekend however extubation was not attempted due to pt
s profound
   muscle weakness and concern that he may tire quickly and require
   re-intubation.  Trach placed [**4-11**].

   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Is staying
   normotensive.
   - Captopril d/c
d due to propensity to cause rashes
   - Increase metoprolol to 25 mg TID and titrate upward as necessary
   .

 chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from current acute illness, ICU
   setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri and central pontine
   myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. Repeat MRI shows unchanged small
   subdural defect and continued evolution of likely central pontine
   myelinolysis. Likely due to fast correction of hyponatremia on

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, presenting with wet beriberi, tachycardia, dyspnea, and fever of unknown origin. He was transferred to the ICU for persistent respiratory distress and fever. The patient has been extubated multiple times due to profound muscle weakness, but remains tracheostomized. He also has altered mental status, which appears to be improving, and central pontine myelinolysis seen on MRI brain. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/75 mmHg to 138/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has a rash and anemia, with a stable hematocrit level between 23-25%. His sodium levels have resolved, but he still has coagulopathy with an INR of 1.7. The patient's electrolytes are stable, and he is on tube feeds with a Dobhoff tube due to a truncal rash. He has a history of chronic ethanol ingestion and is being monitored for withdrawal. The patient's medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and metoprolol.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fever unknown origin
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Patient with good RSBI and NIF over
   weekend however extubation was not attempted due to pt
s profound
   muscle weakness and concern that he may tire quickly and require
   re-intubation.  Trach placed [**4-11**].
   - Cont trach mask trials as tolerated
   - Still awaiting BAL results (if pos for hemosiderin-laden Macros,
   pathology still pending).  ANCA and anti-GBM pending.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Also starting to become
   hypertensive.
   - Captopril d/c
d due to propensity to cause rashes
   - Increase metoprolol to 25 mg TID and titrate upward as necessary
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion,
   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction,
   dry beri beri and central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**].
   MRA is okay, ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast
   correction of hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate Neuro recs;
   unfortunately, it
s an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs re: prognosis for cognitive recovery, any other
   necessary tests for work up, and the use of zyprexa for discomfort and
   agitation
   - F/u repeat MRI head
   - Cont to hold lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash
 added to allergy list
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem) and was less febrile off all
   antibiotics, wich is c/w drug fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Bronch
 BAL so far unrevealing. F/u on outstanding studies.
   - C. diff neg multiple times
   - fluid collection in stomach seen on imaging, however not amenable to
   drainage due to location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   repeat MRI [**4-12**]. [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it
   diagnosis of exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did not
   show any bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in differential.
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
   - RSV neg
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
   .
   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,
   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been
   stable over the last several days.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI changed to qday
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid
   140s. TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver
   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.
   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy (2U
   FFP [**4-11**] prior to trach)
   - follow coags/Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]
   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement
 none to date
   - Keppra and captopril stopped
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.
   - SW consult.
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian removed (placed [**4-4**]), A-line to be d/c
   peripheral, PICC not needed, Foley change to condom cath
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Patient/ Parents.
   .
   # Disposition: Trach in place, Dobhoff until rash resolves. CM and PT
   screen for rehab: [**Hospital 189**] Rehab. Likely this PM or tomorrow. SW
   helping to file long-term disability papers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol ingestion and wet beriberi, who has been admitted to the ICU for persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fever of unknown origin. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status due to delirium, central pontine myelinolysis, and liver dysfunction. He also has anemia, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and a rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to the need for reintubation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could progress to arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may continue or deteriorate, potentially causing further discomfort and increasing the risk of complications.
4. Infection: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient continues to have persistent fevers. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding or malnutrition.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding during procedures or lead to spontaneous bleeding events.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: Although the patient's hyponatremia has improved, there is a risk of electrolyte imbalances occurring in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fever unknown origin
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Extubated and trach placed [**4-11**]. CXR
   improved.
   - Cont trach mask to keep O2 sats > 93%
   - BAL results (neg for hemosiderin-laden Macros).  ANCA neg and
   anti-GBM remains pending, but not likely to be positive.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Is staying
   normotensive.
   - Captopril d/c
d due to propensity to cause rashes
   - Increase metoprolol to 25 mg TID
 will wait for outpatient follow up
   before increasing dose
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Appears to be improving. Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from current acute illness, ICU
   setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri and central pontine
   myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. Repeat MRI shows unchanged small
   subdural defect and continued evolution of likely central pontine
   myelinolysis. Likely due to fast correction of hyponatremia on
   admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it
s an irreversible
   process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs
 will follow up as outpatient
   - Repeat MRI head
 essentially unchanged
   - Cont to hold lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash
 added to allergy list
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem) and was less febrile off all
   antibiotics, wich is c/w drug fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Bronch
 BAL negative
   - C. diff neg multiple times
   - fluid collection in stomach seen on imaging, however not amenable to
   drainage due to location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   repeat MRI [**4-12**], unchanged. [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however
   it
s a diagnosis of exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did
   not show any bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in
   differential.
   - recent sputum and urine pos for yeast
 likely non-pathologic at this
   time
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
 have been negative recently
   - RSV neg
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
 no new issues
   .
   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 23-25 over past several days. Pt has many
   reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness, guaiac pos stools. Likely
   resolving slow GI bleed.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI changed to qday
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid
   140s. TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Na, Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR normalizing without treatment to 1.7. Likely due to
   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this
   admission. Needs Vit K and FFP prior to invasive procedures.
   - follow coags/Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]
   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement
 none to date
   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.  Social Work following
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, stable on tube feeds.  Dobhoff in place as
   G tube cannot be placed in setting of  truncal rash.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt
 OOB to chair
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian removed (placed [**4-4**]), A-line to be d/c
   peripheral, Foley changed to condom cath

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beri-beri, who was transferred to the ICU for persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fever of unknown origin. The patient has several medical complications including tachypnea, tachycardia, altered mental status, fever, anemia, hyponatremia, dry beri beri, coagulopathy, rash, ethanol withdrawal, feeding difficulties, and prophylaxis measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory distress and subsequent extubation may lead to complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Tachycardia: The persistent tachycardia could potentially result in cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion and disorientation could progress to delirium or worsen due to underlying central nervous system (CNS) pathology.
4. Fever: The persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage suggest a possible drug fever or an ongoing infection, which may require further investigation.
5. Anemia: The patient's stable HCT levels indicate ongoing blood loss or inadequate production, potentially leading to worsening anemia and hypoxia.
6. Hyponatremia: Although resolved, the initial hyponatremia correction should be closely monitored to prevent central pontine myelinolysis or other neurological complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fever unknown origin
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Extubated and trach placed [**4-11**]. CXR
   improved. Stable.
   - Cont trach mask to keep O2 sats > 93%
   - anti-GBM pending
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to
   resolving high output  fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central
   disease. Is staying normotensive. Responding well to metoprolol.
   - Captopril d/c
d due to propensity to cause rashes
   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg TID
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Appears to be improving. Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from current acute illness, ICU
   setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri and central pontine
   myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. Repeat MRI shows unchanged small
   subdural defect and continued evolution of likely central pontine
   myelinolysis. Likely due to fast correction of hyponatremia on
   admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it
s an irreversible
   process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs
 will follow up as outpatient
   - Repeat MRI head
 essentially unchanged
   - Cont to hold lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash
 added to allergy list
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Extensive infectious work up all
   negative. Became less febrile off all antibiotics, which is c/w drug
   fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 23-25 over past several days. Pt has many
   reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness, guaiac pos stools. Likely
   resolving slow GI bleed.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI changed to qday
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid
   140s. TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Na, Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR normalizing without treatment to 1.7. Likely due to
   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this
   admission. Needs Vit K and FFP prior to invasive procedures.
   - follow coags/Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]
   - Derm input: likely drug reaction; watch for signs of mucosal
   involvement
 none to date
   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction (Keppra more
   likely to cause rash and fever)
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, stable on tube feeds.  Has a Dobhoff-
   needs a PEG once truncal rash resolves
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt
 OOB to chair
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Patient/ Parents.
   .
   # Disposition: Trach in place, Dobhoff until rash resolves then PEG. CM
   working on placement at [**Hospital1 189**]. Discharge once bed becomes available.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a cachectic alert individual who is currently in the ICU. They have a history of allergies to Keppra, which caused a rash. The patient has been on heparin sodium prophylaxis since April 14th. Vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 89-106 beats per minute, blood pressure fluctuating between 92/48 mmHg and 154/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals coarse upper airway sounds with rhonchi bilaterally, poor dentition, an NG tube, and tracheostomy tube in place. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rapid regular rhythm, and abdominal examination is unremarkable. Neurologic examination shows the patient moving hands and toes on command. There is also a morbilliform rash present.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.7-9.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. Electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fever unknown origin
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Extubated and trach placed [**4-11**]. CXR
   improved.
   - Cont trach mask to keep O2 sats > 93%
   - BAL results (neg for hemosiderin-laden Macros).  ANCA neg and
   anti-GBM remains pending, but not likely to be positive.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Is staying
   normotensive.
   - Captopril d/c
d due to propensity to cause rashes
   - Increase metoprolol to 25 mg TID
 will wait for outpatient follow up
   before increasing dose
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Appears to be improving. Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from current acute illness, ICU
   setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri and central pontine
   myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. Repeat MRI shows unchanged small
   subdural defect and continued evolution of likely central pontine
   myelinolysis. Likely due to fast correction of hyponatremia on
   admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it
s an irreversible
   process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs
 will follow up as outpatient
   - Repeat MRI head
 essentially unchanged
   - Cont to hold lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash
 added to allergy list
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem) and was less febrile off all
   antibiotics, wich is c/w drug fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.
   **Investigation for infection source so far:
   - Bronch
 BAL negative
   - C. diff neg multiple times
   - fluid collection in stomach seen on imaging, however not amenable to
   drainage due to location.
   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;
   repeat MRI [**4-12**], unchanged. [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however
   it
s a diagnosis of exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did
   not show any bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in
   differential.
   - recent sputum and urine pos for yeast
 likely non-pathologic at this
   time
   - pleural fluid labs
 so far NGTD
   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down
   - Surveillance cultures
 have been negative recently
   - RSV neg
   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs
 no new issues
   .
   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 23-25 over past several days. Pt has many
   reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness, guaiac pos stools. Likely
   resolving slow GI bleed.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI changed to qday
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid
   140s. TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Na, Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR normalizing without treatment to 1.7. Likely due to
   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this
   admission. Needs Vit K and FFP prior to invasive procedures.
   - follow coags/Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]
   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement
 none to date
   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction
   .
   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.  Social Work following
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, stable on tube feeds.  Dobhoff in place as
   G tube cannot be placed in setting of  truncal rash.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt
 OOB to chair
   .
   # Access: Left subclavian removed (placed [**4-4**]), A-line to be d/c
   peripheral, Foley changed to condom cath
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Patient/ Parents.
   .
   # Disposition: Trach in place, Dobhoff until rash resolves. CM and PT
   screen for rehab: [**Hospital 189**] Rehab. Likely today. SW helping to file
   long-term disability papers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with wet beriberi, transferred to the ICU for persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fever of unknown origin. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol ingestion, delirium from acute illness, and central pontine myelinolysis seen on MRI brain. He is also experiencing altered mental status, anemia, hyponatremia, dry/wet beri-beri, coagulopathy, rash, and ethanol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea/Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress and tachypnea indicate potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be related to fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is essential to detect any arrhythmias or worsening tachycardia.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to multiple etiologies including chronic alcohol ingestion, delirium from the current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri, and central pontine myelinolysis. Neurological consultation should be sought for further evaluation and management.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels, suggesting ongoing bleeding or inadequate"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for
   persistent tachycardia/dyspnea and fever unknown origin
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Extubated and trach placed [**4-11**]. CXR
   improved. Stable.
   - Cont trach mask to keep O2 sats > 93%
   - anti-GBM pending
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,
   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Is staying
   normotensive. Responding well to metoprolol.
   - Captopril d/c
d due to propensity to cause rashes
   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg TID
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Appears to be improving. Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from current acute illness, ICU
   setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri and central pontine
   myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. Repeat MRI shows unchanged small
   subdural defect and continued evolution of likely central pontine
   myelinolysis. Likely due to fast correction of hyponatremia on
   admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it
s an irreversible
   process. Can cause visual problems.
   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium
   component of his mental status.
   - f/u neuro recs
 will follow up as outpatient
   - Repeat MRI head
 essentially unchanged
   - Cont to hold lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid
   diarrhea
   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash
 added to allergy list
   - continue nutritional support
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Extensive infectious work up all
   negative. Became less febrile off all antibiotics, which is c/w drug
   fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 23-25 over past several days. Pt has many
   reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness, guaiac pos stools. Likely
   resolving slow GI bleed.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI changed to qday
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid
   140s. TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   - Trend Na, Cr
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR normalizing without treatment to 1.7. Likely due to
   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this
   admission. Needs Vit K and FFP prior to invasive procedures.
   - follow coags/Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]
   - Derm input: likely drug reaction; watch for signs of mucosal
   involvement
 none to date
   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction (Keppra more

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of wet beriberi, transferred to the ICU for persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/80 to 154/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented, with a tracheostomy and nasogastric tube in place. Physical examination reveals coarse upper airway sounds, rhonchi bilaterally, and 2+ edema in dependent areas. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, likely due to multiple etiologies including chronic alcohol ingestion, delirium, liver dysfunction, dry beriberi, and central pontine myelinolysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and there are coarse upper airway sounds with rhonchi bilaterally. This may indicate a potential respiratory infection or obstruction.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently above normal, which could be due to fever, cardiomyopathy, underlying central nervous system disease, or other causes.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri, transferred to ICU for persistent
   tachycardia/dyspnea and fever unknown origin. Received trach/PEG and
   now clinically improved.
   .
   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Extubated and trach placed [**4-11**].
   Doing well on trach mask.
   - Cont trach mask to keep O2 sats > 93%
   - anti-GBM negative
   .
   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to
   resolving high output fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central
   disease. Is staying normotensive. Responding well to metoprolol.
   - Captopril d/c
d due to propensity to cause rashes
   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg TID
   .
   # Altered mental status: Much improved now. Alert and oriented x 3 and
   appropriate.  Multiple etiologies
 chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium
   from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri
   beri and central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI which was likely due to
   fast correction of hyponatremia on admission. Repeat MRI essentially
   the same. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it
s an irreversible
   process. Can also cause visual problems.
   - f/u neuro recs
 will follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,
   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Extensive infectious work up all
   negative. Became less febrile off all antibiotics, which is c/w drug
   fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 23-25 over past several days. Pt has many
   reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness, guaiac pos stools. Likely
   resolving slow GI bleed.
   - Maintain Hct >21
   - Keep an active type and cross
   - PPI changed to qday
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid
   140s. TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test
   .
   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.
   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR normalizing without treatment to 1.7. Likely due to
   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this
   admission. Received 2U FFP prior to PEG yesterday. Needs Vit K and FFP
   prior to invasive procedures.
   - follow coags/Hct.
   .
   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**].
   Now resolving
   - Derm input: likely drug reaction; watch for signs of mucosal
   involvement
 none to date
   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction (Keppra more
   likely to cause rash and fever)
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes. PEG ok for meds only until afternoon
   today. Then can start Tube Feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt
 OOB to chair
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # Code: full

","The patient is a 39-year-old man with beriberi, fevers, tachycardia, poor muscle strength, and weakness. He has undergone PEG insertion and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.2 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/67 mmHg to 142/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's review of systems is mostly unchanged from admission, except for anemia and no seizures. Physical examination findings include thin appearance, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and attentive behavior. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's assessment includes beriberi with improving weakness and poor muscle strength, low-grade fevers without clear infectious sources, and a rash attributed to Keppra, which has improved after stopping the medication. The patient's plan includes continued ICU care with nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pressure injuries due to prolonged immobilization, and bloodstream infections from central venous catheters. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory"
