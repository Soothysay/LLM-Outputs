   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis.
   # Cerebral Encephalitis/Edema/Uncal Herniation: At this time the
   etiology is unclear, but differential is broad. Infectious etiology for
   encephalitis/meningitis is particularly of concern.  Patient
s initial
   complaint of shortness of breath may be related to viral
   syndrome/bacterial infection.   Her recent CTA is notable for right
   lobe ground glass opacities, new from OSH, but seen on old CT from 1
   month ago.  Viral etiology include: HSV, H1N1.  Bacterial etiology
   include: Strep pneumo, hemophaelus, meningococcal, listeria
   (particularly in the setting of prior listeria bacteremia).  She has a
   marked rise in her leukocytosis (~35) from baseline of teens, though
   this could also be explained as a reactive rise secondary to receiving
   iv steroids at OSH.  Other possibility is malignancy.  Patient has
   known metastatic malignancy, and these changes seen on head CT can
   reflect metastasis/leptomeningeal spread of malignancy.  Finally,
   metabolic etiology including hepatitis and hyponatremia should be
   considered.  She also has recently suffered an insult: acute hepatitis
   that was suspected to be related to herbal medicine ingestion.  A toxic
   metabolic effect from hepatic encephalopathy can cause acute elevations
   in ICP and cerebral edema.  Though her LFTs remain are high but at
   baseline, CT prelim read is concerning for mets to abdomen.
   - Continue to cover with broad spectrum antibiotics: Aztreonam (pcn
   allergy), Vanc (which should cover listeria, though this is not ideal
   coverage and ampicillin is the preferred choice), Fluconazole (given
   likely superimposed fungal infection of skin rash)
   - Will add tamiflu, flu swab is pending and acyclovir for HSV
   - Infectious work up: sputum, urine, blood, r/o flu
   - ID consult re: abx regimen in particular listeria coverage should be
   confirmed
   - Appreciate neurology recs
   - Urgent MRI head r/o mass/metastasis and evaluate further herniation
   - Mannitol 25 Q6hr
   - Q1hour neuro check
   - Holding LP given ? herniation on CT
   - Serum Na and Osm Q6h, not to exceed Na 150, osm 350
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - F/u final read of CTA chest
   - F/u final read of CT head
   - Follow LFTs and check RUQ US to further assess liver dysfunction
   - Trend leukocytosis
   - Trend fever curve
   - Neurosurg consult
   # Shock:  Currently patient is on levophed.  The etiology of shock
   remains broad.  Patient is with low CVP, can be secondary to
   distributive shock secondary to infection (as outlined above) vs
   adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol/hyponatremia).  Hypovolemia is
   another possibility, though less likely to explain entire picture.  Her
   most recent echo was significant for tumor compression of LV, pulm HTN,
   and mild MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 53**] is likely preload dependent and in the setting of
   intubation CO can be compromised with poor forward flow.  Will need to
   follow up with a new echo on this admission.  Of note, CTA not sig for
   PE.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Cont. levophed, titrate to MAP > 60
   - Infectious work up as outlined above with: sputum, blood, urine and
   empiric antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral regimen.
   - Stress steroids today for adrenal insufficiency
   - ECHO for further evaluation
   - IVFs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation:  Per Onc, her respiratory status
   is poor at baseline.  At baseline, she is hypercarbic with elevated
   pCO2 and HCO3.  Per family, were concerned that patient was short of
   breath and she was intubated in the ED.  Major concerns are her
   underlying restrictive pulmonary disease with markedly reduced lung
   volumes and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Her CTA is notable for
   worsening ground glass opacities in the right lung concerning for
   infection, which are concerning for an overlying infectious etiology
   (viral vs bacterial).  Given her myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], a flare is a
   possibility though she has been in remission per OMR notes.   Will need
   a follow up Echo as mentioned above.
   - Follow infectious work up as outlined
   - Treat with aztreonam/vanc/fluc/acyclovir/tamiflu empirically
   - F/u final CT head
   - F/u final read CTA
   - MRI head stat
   - Echo
   - Check NIFs as patient is more alert this AM
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious etiology as outlined above
   differential broad.  Pulm source is possibility given new findings on
   CT chest.  Viral (H1N1) vs Bacterial (atypical vs typicals) are
   possible etiologies.  Patient also w/ recent listeria bacteremia.
   Other potential culprits: HSV encephalitis or fungal infection.
   Patient did receive high dose steroid in OSH and does have cerebral
   edema, and certainly a component of her leukocytosis may be reactive.
   - Infectious w/o as previously outlined with current broad spec
   abx/antifungal/anti viral agents
   - Trend CBC
   - Trend fever curve
   .
   # Elevated Trop:  EKG without acute changes significant for ischemia,
   but evident for some old STDs.  Trop not rising.  No PE on CTA
   -  EKGs
   - ECHO
   .
   # Hepatitis:  Can be contributing to current picture of
   encephalopathy.  Pt had an extensive work-up on last admission, found
   to have toxin-induced hepatitis, likely from her Eastern herbal
   medications; however current CT abdomen concerning for progression of
   malignancy which can also be attributed to her hepatic dysfunction.  Of
   note atypical cells noted on para during last admission.  She appears
   to have minimal sythetic dysfunction.
   - Right upper quadrant ultrasound
   - Trend LFTs
   - Holding furosemide, spironolactone given shock above
   .
   # Rash: Likely drug reaction to meropenem was noted on last discharge
   summary.  There remains a concern for superimposed fungal infection.
   - Monitor rash as pt received dose of meropenam in ED
   - Fluconazole
   - If receives pcn/cephalosporins will need desensitization
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Improved with ivfs which is consistent with
   hypovolemic hyponatremia.  However, in the setting of cerebral edema,
   possible pneumonia will continue to monitor hyponatremia related to
   SIADH
   - Trend NA
   - Hold Furosemide, Spironolactone as above
   - IVFs for shock
   .
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]:  Per Neuro clinic notes, this has been in
   remission for the past 2 years.  She has not had any recent medications
   that might have induced a flare.
   - Will wean sedation to check a NIF
   - Consider Tensilon test
   .
   # Malignant Thymoma:  Per Onc, there are no further treatment options.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Cerebral Edema and Uncal Herniation: The patient's CT head is preliminary for cerebral edema and uncal herniation. This is a serious condition that requires immediate attention and intervention.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and is intubated. There are concerns about her underlying restrictive pulmonary disease, markedly reduced lung volumes, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and worsening ground glass opacities in the right lung concerning for infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which is not in shock. The etiology of shock remains broad and could be secondary to distributive shock due to infection, adrenal insufficiency, or hypovolemia.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a count of 35, which is concerning for an infectious etiology. The differential includes viral (HSV, H1N1) and bacterial (Strep pneumo, hemophaelus, meningococcal, listeria) infections, as well as malignancy or hepatic dysfunction.

5. Hepatitis: The patient has acute hepatitis, suspected to be related to herbal medicine ingestion. This could contribute to the current picture of encephalopathy.

6. Rash: The patient has a drug reaction rash likely secondary to meropenem,"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis.
   # Cerebral Encephalitis/Edema/Uncal Herniation: At this time the
   etiology is unclear, but differential is broad.  Patient has known
   metastatic malignancy, and these changes seen on head CT can reflect
   metastasis/leptomeningeal spread of malignancy.  She also has recently
   suffered an insult: acute hepatitis that was suspected to be related to
   herbal medicine ingestion.  A toxic metabolic effect from hepatic
   encephalopathy can cause acute elevations in ICP and cerebral edema.
   However, while her LFTs remain elevated (in particular elevated AP/ t
   bili), these elevations are close to baseline and do not suggest an
   acute decompensation.  Infectious etiology for encephalitis/meningitis
   also remains a possibility.  Patient
s initial complaint of shortness
   of breath may be related to viral syndrome/bacterial infection.
   Moreover, she was recently treated for listeria bacteremia.  She has a
   marked rise in her leukocytosis (~35) from baseline of teens, though
   this could also be explained as a reactive rise secondary to receiving
   iv steroids at OSH.
   - Continue to cover with broad spectrum antibiotics: Aztreonam, Vanc
   (which should cover listeria), and Fluconazole (given likely
   superimposed fungal infection of skin rash)
   - Infectious work up: sputum, urine, blood, r/o flu
   - Neurology has been [**Name (NI) 420**], awaiting recommendations
   - Defer LP at this time, given evidence of herniation
   - Send off ammonia with AM labs
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - F/u final read of CTA chest
   - F/u final read of CT head
   - Trend leukocytosis
   - Trend fever curve
   # Hypotension:  Currently on levophed.  Her hypotension was in the
   setting of intubation/sedation.  However given the concern for
   infectious etiology, ? infectious etiology prelim seen on CTA, low CVPs
   sepsis is a concern.  Moreover, she is on chronic steroids,
   hyponatremic on presentation, and adrenal insufficiency remains a
   possibility.  Hypovolemia likely also contributing, as she appeared dry
   on presentation.  Her most recent echo was significant for tumor
   compression of LV, pulm HTN, and mild MR but w/ EF 70%.  Will need to
   follow up with a new echo on this admission.  Of note, CTA not sig for
   PE.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Cont. levophed, titrate to MAP > 60
   - Infectious work up: sputum, urine, blood, r/o flu
   - Continue antibiotics (see above)
   - Follow AM cortisol
   - serial CEs, EKGs
   - ECHO
   .
   # Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation:  Per Onc, her respiratory status
   is poor at baseline.  At baseline, she is hypercarbic with elevated
   pCO2 and HCO3.  Per family, were concerned that patient was short of
   breath and she was intubated in the ED.  Major concerns are her
   underlying restrictive pulmonary disease with markedly reduced lung
   volumes and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Her CTA is notable for
   worsening ground glass opacities in the right lung concerning for pulm
   edema vs infection.  Given her myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], a flare is a
   possibility though she has been in remission per OMR notes.
   - Follow infectious work up as outlined
   - Treat with aztreonam/vanc/fluc
   - F/u final read CTA
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   # Elevated Trop:  EKG without acute changes significant for ischemia,
   but evident for some std ?pericarditis.  Maybe demand ischemia.  No
   evidence of PE.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - ECHO
   .
   # Hepatitis:  Can be contributing to current picture of
   encephalopathy.  Pt had an extensive work-up on last admission, found
   to have toxin-induced hepatitis, likely from her Eastern herbal
   medications.  Spoke with Liver, the cholestatic pattern of LFTs will
   last weeks to months.  She appears to have minimal sythetic
   dysfunction.
   - Repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound
   - Trend LFTs
   - Holding furosemide, spironolactone
   - Checking ammonia level
   .
   # Rash: Likely drug reaction to meropenem was noted on last discharge
   summary.  There remains a concern for superimposed fungal infection.
   - monitor rash as pt received dose of meropenam in ED
   - fluconazole
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Improved with ivfs which is consistent with
   hypovolemic hyponatremia.  However, in the setting of cerebral edema,
   possible pneumonia will continue to monitor hyponatremia related to
   SIADH
   - Trend NA
   - Hold Furosemide, Spironolactone
   .
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]:  Per Neuro clinic notes, this has been in
   remission for the past 2 years.  She has not had any recent medications
   that might have induced a flare.
   - Will wean sedation to check a NIF
   - Consider Tensilon test
   .
   # Malignant Thymoma:  Per Onc, there are no further treatment options.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old woman with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She has a history of known metastatic malignancy and recently suffered an insult: acute hepatitis suspected to be related to herbal medicine ingestion. The patient's initial complaint of shortness of breath may be related to viral syndrome/bacterial infection. She was recently treated for listeria bacteremia. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, elevated troponin, and hyponatremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema/Uncal Herniation: The patient's head CT showed changes indicative of cerebral edema and uncal herniation. The etiology is unclear, but possibilities include hepatic encephalopathy, infectious etiology, or metastasis/leptomeningeal spread of malignancy.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and recent infection history raise concerns for sepsis.
3. Pulmonary Edema/Infection: The worsening ground glass opacities in the right lung on CTA suggest pulmonary edema or infection.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: The elevated troponin levels and EKG findings suggest potential cardiac ischemia.
5. Hepatitis: The patient has worsening hepatitis, which may contribute to the current picture of encephalopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old lady with a history of malignant thymoma who was admitted for worsening shortness of breath and intubated. The patient also has worsening hepatitis and other medical conditions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and concern for meningeal carcinomatosis are significant concerns. Meningeal carcinomatosis refers to the spread of cancer cells to the meninges, which can lead to cognitive impairment and other neurological symptoms.

2. Shock: The patient is currently on levophed, indicating the need for vasopressor support, suggesting possible shock. Shock is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to the body's organs.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Difficulty removing the ventilator may be anticipated due to poor lung function. This can lead to further respiratory complications.

4. Hepatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest ongoing hepatic dysfunction, which can contribute to encephalopathy. Progressive malignancy may also be a concern, leading to worsening liver function.

5. Rash: The patient has a history of drug reactions and a current concern for a superimposed fungal infection or cutaneous manifestations of cancer.

6. Hyponatremia: Although improved, the patient's hyponatremia is a concern and needs close monitoring to prevent complications associated with electroly"

 HEPATITIS OTHER
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis.
   # Cerebral Encephalitis/Edema/Uncal Herniation: At this time the
   etiology is unclear, but differential is broad. Infectious etiology for
   encephalitis/meningitis is particularly of concern.  Patient
s initial
   complaint of shortness of breath may be related to viral
   syndrome/bacterial infection.   Her recent CTA is notable for right
   lobe ground glass opacities, new from OSH, but seen on old CT from 1
   month ago.  Viral etiology include: HSV, H1N1.  Bacterial etiology
   include: Strep pneumo, hemophaelus, meningococcal, listeria
   (particularly in the setting of prior listeria bacteremia).  She has a
   marked rise in her leukocytosis (~35) from baseline of teens, though
   this could also be explained as a reactive rise secondary to receiving
   iv steroids at OSH.  Other possibility is malignancy.  Patient has
   known metastatic malignancy, and these changes seen on head CT can
   reflect metastasis/leptomeningeal spread of malignancy.  Finally,
   metabolic etiology including hepatitis and hyponatremia should be
   considered.  She also has recently suffered an insult: acute hepatitis
   that was suspected to be related to herbal medicine ingestion.  A toxic
   metabolic effect from hepatic encephalopathy can cause acute elevations
   in ICP and cerebral edema.  Though her LFTs remain are high but at
   baseline, CT prelim read is concerning for mets to abdomen.
   - Continue to cover with broad spectrum antibiotics: Aztreonam (pcn
   allergy), Vanc (which should cover listeria, though this is not ideal
   coverage and ampicillin is the preferred choice), Fluconazole (given
   likely superimposed fungal infection of skin rash)
   - Will add tamiflu, flu swab is pending and acyclovir for HSV
   - Infectious work up: sputum, urine, blood, r/o flu
   - ID consult re: abx regimen in particular listeria coverage should be
   confirmed
   - Appreciate neurology recs
   - Urgent MRI head r/o mass/metastasis and evaluate further herniation
   - Mannitol 25 Q6hr
   - Q1hour neuro check
   - Holding LP given ? herniation on CT
   - Serum Na and Osm Q6h, not to exceed Na 150, osm 350
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - F/u final read of CTA chest
   - F/u final read of CT head
   - Follow LFTs and check RUQ US to further assess liver dysfunction
   - Trend leukocytosis
   - Trend fever curve
   - Neurosurg consult
   # Shock:  Currently patient is on levophed.  The etiology of shock
   remains broad.  Patient is with low CVP, can be secondary to
   distributive shock secondary to infection (as outlined above) vs
   adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol/hyponatremia).  Hypovolemia is
   another possibility, though less likely to explain entire picture.  Her
   most recent echo was significant for tumor compression of LV, pulm HTN,
   and mild MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 53**] is likely preload dependent and in the setting of
   intubation CO can be compromised with poor forward flow.  Will need to
   follow up with a new echo on this admission.  Of note, CTA not sig for
   PE.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Cont. levophed, titrate to MAP > 60
   - Infectious work up as outlined above with: sputum, blood, urine and
   empiric antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral regimen.
   - Stress steroids today for adrenal insufficiency
   - ECHO for further evaluation
   - IVFs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation:  Per Onc, her respiratory status
   is poor at baseline.  At baseline, she is hypercarbic with elevated
   pCO2 and HCO3.  Per family, were concerned that patient was short of
   breath and she was intubated in the ED.  Major concerns are her
   underlying restrictive pulmonary disease with markedly reduced lung
   volumes and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Her CTA is notable for
   worsening ground glass opacities in the right lung concerning for
   infection, which are concerning for an overlying infectious etiology
   (viral vs bacterial).  Given her myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], a flare is a
   possibility though she has been in remission per OMR notes.   Will need
   a follow up Echo as mentioned above.
   - Follow infectious work up as outlined
   - Treat with aztreonam/vanc/fluc/acyclovir/tamiflu empirically
   - F/u final CT head
   - F/u final read CTA
   - MRI head stat
   - Echo
   - Check NIFs as patient is more alert this AM
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious etiology as outlined above
   differential broad.  Pulm source is possibility given new findings on
   CT chest.  Viral (H1N1) vs Bacterial (atypical vs typicals) are
   possible etiologies.  Patient also w/ recent listeria bacteremia.
   Other potential culprits: HSV encephalitis or fungal infection.
   Patient did receive high dose steroid in OSH and does have cerebral
   edema, and certainly a component of her leukocytosis may be reactive.
   - Infectious w/o as previously outlined with current broad spec
   abx/antifungal/anti viral agents
   - Trend CBC
   - Trend fever curve
   .
   # Elevated Trop:  EKG without acute changes significant for ischemia,
   but evident for some old STDs.  Trop not rising.  No PE on CTA
   -  EKGs
   - ECHO
   .
   # Hepatitis:  Can be contributing to current picture of
   encephalopathy.  Pt had an extensive work-up on last admission, found
   to have toxin-induced hepatitis, likely from her Eastern herbal
   medications; however current CT abdomen concerning for progression of
   malignancy which can also be attributed to her hepatic dysfunction.  Of
   note atypical cells noted on para during last admission.  She appears
   to have minimal sythetic dysfunction.
   - Right upper quadrant ultrasound
   - Trend LFTs
   - Holding furosemide, spironolactone given shock above
   .
   # Rash: Likely drug reaction to meropenem was noted on last discharge
   summary.  There remains a concern for superimposed fungal infection.
   - Monitor rash as pt received dose of meropenam in ED
   - Fluconazole
   - If receives pcn/cephalosporins will need desensitization
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Improved with ivfs which is consistent with
   hypovolemic hyponatremia.  However, in the setting of cerebral edema,
   possible pneumonia will continue to monitor hyponatremia related to
   SIADH
   - Trend NA
   - Hold Furosemide, Spironolactone as above
   - IVFs for shock
   .
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]:  Per Neuro clinic notes, this has been in
   remission for the past 2 years.  She has not had any recent medications
   that might have induced a flare.
   - Will wean sedation to check a NIF
   - Consider Tensilon test
   .
   # Malignant Thymoma:  Per Onc, there are no further treatment options.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. The patient has multiple medical complications including cerebral edema, hyponatremia, respiratory failure, shock, leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, rash, and hepatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:

1. Cerebral Edema: This condition can lead to increased intracranial pressure and herniation. The patient is already on mannitol to reduce ICP and will need close monitoring of neurologic status.

2. Hyponatremia: If not managed properly, it can worsen cerebral edema and potentially lead to seizures or permanent neurological damage.

3. Respiratory Failure: If the patient's respiratory status worsens, it can result in further hypoxia and hypercapnia, leading to organ dysfunction and potential multi-organ failure.

4. Shock: If not appropriately managed, the patient may develop further hypotension and organ perfusion abnormalities, leading to tissue hypoxia and organ damage.

5. Leukocytosis: This indicates an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If the underlying cause is not identified and treated, it can progress to sepsis and septic shock.

6. Elevated Troponin Levels: These levels suggest myocardial injury. If the underlying cause is not addressed, it can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, and hepatitis. They have been receiving multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have a history of allergies to penicillins and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The patient's blood work shows elevated liver enzymes and troponin levels. They have been mechanically ventilated since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can lead to the formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, increasing the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers - Critically ill patients are at a higher risk of developing stress ulcers due to the body's stress response. Prophylactic medications are being given to prevent this.
4. Hepatitis - The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating potential liver injury. Further investigation is required to determine the cause and severity of hepatitis.
5. Cardiac complications - Elevated troponin levels suggest possible cardiac injury or dysfunction. Monitoring for signs of heart failure or arrhythmias is important.
6. Pressure ulcers - Impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of thymoma, pleural/peritoneal involvement, toxic hepatopathy, and myasthenia gravis. She was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and later developed hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy that did not show any mass, and a head CTA was done to rule out aneurysm. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and other medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes indicating possible hepatitis.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a diffuse rash with desquamation, which may lead to impaired skin integrity.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to multifactorial causes such as restriction from metastases, central drive issue, new right lower lobe ground-glass opacities/pneumonia, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, or neuromuscular disease.
4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, possibly due to sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, post-pneumonectomy vent dependency, sedation, or third-spacing of fluids.
5. Neurological Status: The patient has a hemorrhagic LP, and further evaluation is needed for HSV PCR, as she is awake and follows commands.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis, thymoma, and recent admission for acute respiratory failure. The patient's arterial line was started on 03/21/2122 at 08:00 PM, and a CT angiography (CTA) of the head revealed subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with high-density material in the left frontal sulci. The patient has been on levophed due to distributive shock, which could be caused by adrenal insufficiency or sepsis. The patient's blood cultures, lumbar puncture (LP), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative for growth, ruling out infectious etiology. The patient is also on acyclovir for possible herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The patient has a history of morbiliform rash and elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which could be drug-induced or related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving restrictive lung disease, atypical pneumonia, and myasthenia gravis. The patient's myasthenia gravis is currently in remission, and the neurologist will recheck the neuromuscular junction (NIF) today. The patient's disposition is currently undetermined.

 HEPATITIS OTHER
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   #Shock: Currently  levophed. Can be distributive: adrenal insuff w/ low
   cortisol, sepsis also possibility though blood cx, LP, BAL, and urine
   w/o growth.  Pt r/o for flu, tamiflu d/c'd. Cardiogenic (preload
   dependence in pt with pulm htn and mass compressing LV)
   -- Taper steroids, started for adrenal insuff
   -- F/u final BAL, CSF, Blood cx
   -- Can start tapering off abx as cx data unrevealing
   -- Cont acyclovir, HSV PCR pending
   .
   #Acute Resp failure: Patient tolerated PSV 17/5 briefly, placed back on
   volume control given low tidal volumes.  NIF unable to be assessed as
   she was too sedated.  Likely multifactorial, in the setting of
   restrictive lung disease, ?atypical pna, metabolic encephalopathy, and
   history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**].
   -- Continue SBT trials, will attempt to recheck NIF today
   -- F/u BAL results

   #Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity
   (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  LFTs
   stably elevated. US w/ patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- Continue to trend LFTs
   -- Holding diuretics
   .
   # Rash: Drug related vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can
   see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This
   autoimmune phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive
   thymoma, pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- Will discuss derm consult w/ possible skin biopsy
   .
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF 14.  Will
   recheck NIF today.  Neuro is involved.
   .
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis and thymoma, who presented to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. She was found to have an arterial line placed and was on mechanical ventilation. The arterial line was inserted due to hypotension, which was not in shock. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicated respiratory failure. She had a CT angiography (CTA) that showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated, and she had a morbidly rash. She was on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and aztreonam. Her platelet count was low. The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) levels were within normal range. She was receiving fentanyl and norepinephrine infusions. The patient's medical history included hepatitis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. She was also diagnosed with SAH and thymoma. The patient's condition remained stable, and she tolerated a pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial briefly before being placed back on volume-controlled ventilation. Her NIMS fraction (NIF) was assessed as 7, indicating poor respiratory function. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count was elevated. Her hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet (Plt) levels were within normal range. The patient's glucose levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Shock: The patient had resolved shock, likely multifactorial, possibly due to adrenal insufficiency with low cortisol and sepsis. However, further monitoring and follow-up are necessary.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, including restrictive lung disease, atypical pneumonia, and a history of myasthenia gravis. Continued SBT (spontaneous breathing trial) trials and restart of propofol as needed for agitation should be continued. BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) culture results should be followed up.

3. Left Upper Extremity Edema: There is concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given the patient's metastatic malignancy. A left upper extremity ultrasound should be performed to rule out DVT.

4. Hepatitis: The patient has hepatitis, which could be drug-induced or associated with thymoma. Further monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is necessary, and diuretics should be held.

5. Rash: The patient has a rash that may be drug-related or associated with thymoma-related multiorgan autoimmunity. A dermatology consult with possible skin biopsy is recommended"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The patient has a history of myasthenia gravis and thymoma. They are experiencing shortness of breath (SOB) and require respiratory support through an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is within normal range, heart rate is slightly elevated, blood pressure is within normal limits, respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has undergone multiple interventions and treatments, including placement of a PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. They have been receiving various medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, famotidine, and others. The patient's allergies include penicillins and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated. The results of the fluid analysis indicate a slightly acidic pH, elevated pCO2, normal pO2, and elevated HCO3 levels.

The patient has several ongoing assessments and plans, including alterations in nutrition, ineffective coping, hepatitis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU and received treatment for suspected sepsis with multi-organ involvement. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He has shown improvement in his respiratory status but still requires high levels of FiO2 to maintain oxygenation.

Medical Complications:

1. Peripheral Edema: The patient has edema in both lower extremities, indicating possible fluid overload or an underlying cardiovascular issue.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has jaundice and a rash, suggesting impaired skin integrity and potential liver dysfunction.

3. Hepatitis: The presence of scleral icterus and jaundice suggests hepatitis, possibly related to the patient's underlying medical condition or a complication of the ICU stay.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, inadequate fluid resuscitation, or cardiac dysfunction.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The cause of the respiratory failure is still under investigation, with potential contributors including sepsis-induced ARDS, pneumonia, or other pulmonary complications.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may"

   #Acute Resp failure: Worsening, requiring more FiO2 yesterday. Likely
   multifactorial, in the setting of restrictive lung disease, ?atypical

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She has a history of myasthenia gravis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is experiencing respiratory failure. She also has peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, and acute limb ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening despite being on mechanical ventilation. There may be a need to consider increasing steroids as this may be treating the underlying thymoma-related hypersensitivity syndrome.
2. Hepatitis: The patient's hepatitis is drug-induced or associated with thymoma-related multiorgan autoimmunity. Further evaluation and monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) are recommended.
3. Rash: The patient has a morbiliform rash that could be drug-related or associated with thymoma-related multiorgan autoimmunity. A dermatology consult with possible skin biopsy is advised.
4. Myasthenia Gravis: The patient has a history of myasthenia gravis, which is currently in remission. Neurological involvement and monitoring of neuromuscular status are necessary.
5. Subacute Chronic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage, which requires monitoring of neurological status and neurologic recommendations.
6. Thymoma: The"

   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis.
   #Shock: Resolved at present.
   -- Continue steroids at present dose
   -- F/u final BAL, CSF, Blood cx
   -- Can start tapering off abx as cx data unrevealing, but would start
   with acyclovir first
   -- First DC acyclovir once HSV confirmed negative, HSV PCR currently
   pending
   .
   #Acute Resp failure: Pt with VAP. Likely multifactorial, in the setting
   of restrictive lung disease, ?atypical pna, and history of myasthenia
   [**Last Name (un) 3383**]. Would consider thymoma associated systemic hypersensitivity
   leading to bronchiolitis obliterans of the lungs.
   -- Continue current steroid dose
   -- Call path to expedite skin biopsy to confirm hypersensitivity
   syndrome, if negative would taper off steroids
   -- Continue SBT trials, restart propofol PRN agitation
   -- F/u BAL culture results
   # Acute LUE edema: No DVT on prelim
   -- F/u final U/S report.
   .
   #Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity
   (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  Consider
   widespread metastasis causing cholestasis  LFTs stably elevated. US w/
   patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- Continue to trend LFTs
   -- Holding diuretics
   .
   # Rash: Drug related vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can
   see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This
   autoimmune phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive
   thymoma, pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- F/u skin biopsy
   .
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   .
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid

   - monitor Neurologic status
   - neuro recs, appreciate their input.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 46F met thymoma, pleural / peritoneal
   involvement, toxic hepatopathy p/w hypercarbic resp failure. Developed
   asynchrony and desats yesterday x2.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.4 BP 118/69 HR 95 RR 20 with sat 100 on VAC 0.5

   Labs notable for WBC 32K from 23K, HCT 26, K+ 4.5, Cr 0.2. CXR stable.
   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure
   (restriction from mets, central drive issue, pneumonia, weakness, fluid
   overload) with trial of PSV, sedation c propofol and low dose fentanyl.
   Will check sputum / BAL, treat for new VAP by changing azithro to
   cipro, and initiate diuresis for component of volume overload. CT c/w
   SAH, exam stable / improving - hold off on AEDs, stop acyclovir if HSV
   PCR is negative. Toxic hepatopathy - stable, continue ursidiol, liver
   following, ? thymoma-associated autoimmune syndrome - continue steroids
   at current dose and d/w liver team. MG - stable. Await derm bx results,
   ? autoimmune v drug v fungal. TFs, PICC, art line, HSC, H2B. Patient is
   DNR (no shock / CPR, pressors OK). Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","The patient is a 46-year-old lady with a history of malignant thymoma, who was admitted for worsening shortness of breath and intubated. She also has worsening hepatitis and is currently in the ICU.

Summary of Progress:
- The patient is now on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute.
- Her blood pressure is stable with a reading of 104/61 mmHg, heart rate is 96 beats per minute, oxygen saturation is 98%, and temperature is within normal range at 37.3°C.
- She has peripheral edema in both lower extremities, as well as a rash present on her skin.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 40.8 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- Imaging shows no relevant change in the right lung, but there is an apparent increase in density at the right lung base due to an overlying medical device.
- Microbiology results indicate the presence of Gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs from sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, and there is a concern for VAP given the presence of Gram-positive cocci in clusters"

   #Acute Resp failure: Pt now with VAP with GPCs likely VISA vs MRSA.
   However resp failure likely multifactorial, in the setting of VAP
   restrictive lung disease, and history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**] and muscle
   weakness. Would consider thymoma associated systemic hypersensitivity
   leading to bronchiolitis obliterans of the lungs. Given this developed
   while on presumably therapeutic vanc (trough this am 15) high concern
   for VISA
   -- Narrowing coverage with starting IV linezolid for VAP to cover VISA
   and DC aztreonam, vancomycin
   -- Continue current steroid dose
   -- Call path to expedite skin biopsy to confirm hypersensitivity
   syndrome, if negative would taper off steroids
   -- Continue SBT trials, continue propofol PRN agitation
   -- F/u BAL culture speciation and sensitivities
   .
   #Shock: Resolved at present.
   -- Continue steroids at present dose
   -- F/u final BAL, CSF, Blood cx
   -- Can taper off all abx and start linezolid (per above)
   -- DC acyclovir as HSV confirmed negative

   widespread metastasis causing cholestasis  LFTs stably elevated. US w/
   patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- Continue to trend LFTs
   -- Holding diuretics

   # Rash: Drug related vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can
   see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This
   autoimmune phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive
   thymoma, pathophysiology resembles GVHD.

","The patient is a 46-year-old female with malignant thymoma admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient already has acute respiratory failure due to VAP with Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) likely Vancomycin-Intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) or Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There is a concern for restrictive lung disease, myasthenia gravis, and bronchiolitis obliterans.

2. Hepatitis: The patient has worsening hepatitis, which may be drug-induced or associated with thymoma. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

3. Peripheral edema: The patient has alteration in nutrition and ineffective coping, along with peripheral edema. This could be due to fluid overload or other underlying conditions.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to drug-related hypersensitivity syndrome or thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity.

5. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension but has resolved at present. However, close monitoring is necessary.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, indicating an elevated white blood cell count, which may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old lady with a history of malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She is currently experiencing multiple medical complications that require immediate attention. 

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This is likely multifactorial, considering restrictive lung disease, atypical pneumonia, and a history of myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma. There is a suspicion of thymoma-associated systemic hypersensitivity leading to bronchiolitis obliterans of the lungs. The plan includes continuing current steroid dose, expediting skin biopsy to confirm hypersensitivity syndrome, and restarting propofol PRN agitation.

2. Shock: The patient's shock has resolved for now. The plan includes continuing steroids at the present dose, following up on final BAL, CSF, and blood culture results, and starting linezolid as mentioned above.

3. Acute Left Upper Extremity Edema: There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on preliminary evaluation. The plan includes following up on the final ultrasound report.

4. Hepatitis: There is a possibility of drug-induced hepatitis versus thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. The plan includes trending liver function tests (LFTs) and holding diuretics.

   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis.
   .
   #Acute Resp failure: Pt now with VAP with GPCs likely VISA vs MRSA.
   Likely multifactorial, in the setting of VAP restrictive lung disease,
   ?atypical pna, and history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**]. Would consider thymoma
   associated systemic hypersensitivity leading to bronchiolitis
   obliterans of the lungs.
   -- Continue current steroid dose
   -- Call path to expedite skin biopsy to confirm hypersensitivity
   syndrome, if negative would taper off steroids
   -- Continue SBT trials, continue propofol PRN agitation
   -- F/u BAL culture speciation and sensitivities
   .
   #Shock: Resolved at present.
   -- Continue steroids at present dose
   -- F/u final BAL, CSF, Blood cx
   -- Can taper off all abx and start linezolid (per above)
   -- DC acyclovir as HSV confirmed negative
   .
   # Acute LUE edema: No DVT on prelim
   -- F/u final U/S report.
   .
   #Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity
   (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  Consider
   widespread metastasis causing cholestasis  LFTs stably elevated. US w/
   patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- Continue to trend LFTs
   -- Holding diuretics
   .
   # Rash: Drug related vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can
   see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This
   autoimmune phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive
   thymoma, pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- F/u skin biopsy
   .
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   .
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting
   of hepatitis.
   - monitor Neurologic status
   - neuro recs, appreciate their input.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 46F met thymoma, pleural / peritoneal
   involvement, toxic hepatopathy p/w hypercarbic resp failure. Developed
   asynchrony and desats yesterday x2.

   Labs notable for WBC 32K from 23K, HCT 26, K+ 4.5, Cr 0.2. CXR stable.
   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure
   (restriction from mets, central drive issue, pneumonia, weakness, fluid
   overload) with trial of PSV, sedation c propofol and low dose fentanyl.
   Will check sputum / BAL, treat for new VAP by changing azithro to
   cipro, and initiate diuresis for component of volume overload. CT c/w
   SAH, exam stable / improving - hold off on AEDs, stop acyclovir if HSV
   PCR is negative. Toxic hepatopathy - stable, continue ursidiol, liver
   following, ? thymoma-associated autoimmune syndrome - continue steroids
   at current dose and d/w liver team. MG - stable. Await derm bx results,
   ? autoimmune v drug v fungal. TFs, PICC, art line, HSC, H2B. Patient is

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma, admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including acute respiratory failure, shock, peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, and hepatitis. The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP with Gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs, likely due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
2. Multifactorial respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including restrictive lung disease, atypical pneumonia, and a history of myasthenia gravis.
3. Hepatitis: The patient has worsening hepatitis, which could be drug-induced or associated with thymoma.
4. Peripheral edema: The patient has acute left lower extremity edema, possibly due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other causes.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to pressure ulcers or other factors.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 40.8 K/uL.
7. Thrombotic events:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and a diagnosis of thymoma. She has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including ineffective coping, peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, hypotension, impaired nutrition, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. She is currently on various medications such as linezolid, propofol, famotidine, heparin sodium, furosemide, and tube feeds. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires mechanical ventilation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests. Imaging and microbiology results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause is not addressed.
2. Thymoma-related Hypersensitivity Syndrome: The patient's rash and history of hypersensitivity reaction to thymoma suggest the possibility of thymoma-related hypersensitivity syndrome. This condition can lead to systemic inflammation and organ damage if not managed appropriately.
3. Peripheral Edema: The presence of right and left lower extremity edema indicates peripheral edema. This may be due to fluid overload or underlying cardiac or renal dysfunction. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting fluid administration is"

   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now
   with VAP.
   .
   #Acute Resp failure: Pt now with VAP with GPCs likely VISA vs MRSA.
   However resp failure likely multifactorial, in the setting of VAP
   restrictive lung disease, and history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**] and muscle
   weakness. Would consider thymoma associated systemic hypersensitivity
   leading to bronchiolitis obliterans of the lungs. Given this developed
   while on presumably therapeutic vanc (trough this am 15) high concern
   for VISA
   -- Narrowing coverage with starting IV linezolid for VAP to cover VISA
   and DC aztreonam, vancomycin
   -- Continue current steroid dose
   -- Call path to expedite skin biopsy to confirm hypersensitivity
   syndrome, if negative would taper off steroids
   -- Continue SBT trials, continue propofol PRN agitation
   -- F/u BAL culture speciation and sensitivities
   .
   #Shock: Resolved at present.
   -- Continue steroids at present dose
   -- F/u final BAL, CSF, Blood cx
   -- Can taper off all abx and start linezolid (per above)
   -- DC acyclovir as HSV confirmed negative
   .
   # Acute LUE edema: No DVT on prelim
   -- F/u final U/S report.
   .
   #Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity
   (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  Consider
   widespread metastasis causing cholestasis  LFTs stably elevated. US w/
   patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- Continue to trend LFTs
   -- Holding diuretics
   .
   # Rash: Drug related vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can
   see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This
   autoimmune phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive
   thymoma, pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- F/u skin biopsy
   .
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   .
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma, admitted for worsening shortness of breath and worsening hepatitis.
- The patient was intubated and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Gram-positive cocci likely vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA).
- The patient also has peripheral edema, altered nutrition, ineffective coping, hepatitis other, hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure acute (not ARDS), leukocytosis, and myasthenia gravis.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including VAP, restrictive lung disease, and a history of myasthenia gravis and muscle weakness.
- The patient has been on various medications, including vancomycin, aztreonam, acyclovir, and linezolid.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by drug-induced hepatitis, rash, and potential autoimmune phenomena associated with extensive thymoma.
- The patient's goals of care discussion will be held at 3 pm today.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP with Gram-positive cocci likely VISA. This is a potential complication of mechanical ventilation and can lead to worsening respiratory failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubation, and worsening hepatitis. The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Gram-positive cocci likely VISA or MRSA. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, considering the restrictive lung disease, history of myasthenia gravis, and muscle weakness. There are also concerns about thymoma-associated systemic hypersensitivity leading to bronchiolitis obliterans of the lungs. The patient's metabolic alkalosis may be related to changes in set point or contraction alkalosis. Acute left upper extremity edema is present but no deep vein thrombosis is identified. The patient has hepatitis, possibly drug-induced or associated with thymoma-related multiorgan autoimmunity. The patient also has a rash, which could be part of the autoimmune phenomenon seen in extensive thymoma patients resembling GVHD. Myasthenia gravis is in remission with improved NIF. The patient has subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and coagulopathy may be involved. Thymoma is not currently an active issue. The patient's goals of care will be discussed tomorrow."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), peripheral edema, ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, and metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may be due to VAP, restrictive lung disease, history of myasthenia gravis, and muscle weakness. There is also a possibility of thymoma-associated systemic hypersensitivity leading to bronchiolitis obliterans of the lungs.

The patient has developed hepatitis, which could be drug-induced or related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. The presence of a morbiliform rash and GI involvement further supports this possibility.

The patient also has a history of myasthenia gravis, which is currently in remission. Neurological involvement is present, and the patient is being monitored closely.

Additionally, the patient has experienced a subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely due to platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in the setting of hepatitis.

The patient's nutritional support includes receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at a rate of 35 mL/hour. Glycemic control is also being monitored.

The patient has arterial and PICC lines"

   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now
   with VAP.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Multifactorial and now with MRSA VAP.  WBC trended down but clinically
   appears significantly worse and has been more dependent on ventilator
   support.  Appears uncomfortable. Unlikely to improve despite
   antibiotics and steroids.
   - address goals of care
   - cont linezolid and steroids
   # Hypotension
   Now stable.  Small response to IVF. Okay to start pressors for now.
   # Primary metabolic alkalosis
   Bicarb 35, pH 7.5. [**Month (only) 60**] have improved with NS boluses.
   --monitor
   --could consider diamox if worsens
   # Acute LUE edema: No DVT.
   - monitor
   #Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity
   (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  US w/
   patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- LFTs trending down
points toward hypersensitivity as improving with
   steroids, perhaps
   -- monitor
   # Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- supportive care
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci

","The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and she is unlikely to improve despite antibiotics and steroids.

The patient's hypotension is stable and small responses to intravenous fluids (IVF) have been observed. Pressors can be started for now.

The patient has primary metabolic alkalosis with a bicarbonate level of 35 and pH 7.5. This condition has improved with normal saline (NS) boluses. Monitoring and considering diamox if worsens would be appropriate.

The patient also has acute left upper extremity edema, which is not associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Monitoring is recommended.

There is evidence of hepatitis, which could be drug-induced or related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. The liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, indicating improvement. Monitoring and supportive care are advised.

The patient has a rash, which could be related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Supportive care is recommended.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) has been in remission, and neurologic improvement has been observed. Neurological recommendations are appreciated.

   shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now with VAP.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Multifactorial and now with MRSA VAP.  WBC trended down but clinically
   appears significantly worse and has been more dependent on ventilator
   support.  Appears uncomfortable. Unlikely to improve despite
   antibiotics and steroids.
   - address goals of care
   - cont linezolid and steroids
   # Hypotension
   Now stable.  Small response to IVF. Okay to start pressors for now.
   # Primary metabolic alkalosis
   Bicarb 35, pH 7.5. [**Month (only) 60**] have improved with NS boluses.
   --monitor
   --could consider diamox if worsens
   # Acute LUE edema: No DVT.

   #Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity
   (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  US w/

   -- LFTs trending down
points toward hypersensitivity as improving with
   steroids, perhaps
   -- monitor
   # Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- supportive care
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to VAP, further deterioration of the patient's condition, development of septic shock due to MRSA infection, complications related to the patient's underlying medical conditions such as myasthenia gravis, SAH, and hepatitis, and potential adverse effects of medications and therapies being administered.

It is crucial for the patient's well-being to closely monitor her vital signs, respiratory status, and response to treatment. The healthcare team should also ensure proper glycemic control, infection control measures, and manage any potential complications promptly. Regular reassessment and adjustments to the care plan are necessary to optimize the patient's outcomes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with metastatic thymoma admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a history of penicillin allergy, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim allergy, and a rash. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and failure to wean from the ventilator. She also has hepatitis, a rash, myasthenia gravis, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and is DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient already has respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if VAP is not effectively treated.
2. Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating hepatitis. This can lead to liver dysfunction and complications.
3. Rash: The patient has a morbiliform rash, which may be due to drug-induced hypersensitivity or thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. It is important to monitor the rash for progression or signs of systemic involvement.
4. Myasthenia gravis: The patient has a history of myasthenia gravis, and there is a risk of exacerbation or worsening symptoms.
5. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is a risk of rebleeding or complications related to the SAH.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with metastatic thymoma admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has now developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is failing to wean from the ventilator. She has a penicillin allergy and is on linezolid due to a sputum culture positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The family has agreed to continue maximal supportive care until the middle of next week, after which terminal extubation and comfort measures only (CMO) will be addressed.

The patient is intubated, sedated, and on increasing doses of propofol. She is receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium, colace, ISS (likely intravenous immunoglobulin), hydrocortisone, linezolid, famotidine, calcium carbonate with vitamin D, cyanocobalamin, ursodiol, and fentanyl patch. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 32.9 thousand cells/mm3, slightly elevated hemoglobin of 9."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She has now developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient continues to be clinically significantly worse and has been more dependent on ventilator support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure and has developed VAP with MRSA. There is a concern for continued dependence on the ventilator and potential worsening of respiratory status.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which were multifactorial and possibly related to VAP leading to sepsis. There is a possibility of secondary low albumin/oncotic pressure contributing to hypotension.
3. Primary Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has bicarbonate levels of 35 and pH 7.5, indicating primary metabolic alkalosis. This condition needs to be monitored, and further interventions such as diamox may be considered if necessary.
4. Acute Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has developed edema in her lower extremities. No deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been diagnosed, but monitoring is recommended.
5. Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have shown improvement with steroids, suggesting a drug-induced cause"

1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This is a serious infection that can worsen respiratory function and potentially lead to sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be multifactorial in nature. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely and manage with appropriate interventions such as intravenous fluids and pressors.
3. Hepatitis: The patient has hepatitis, possibly drug-induced or related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Monitoring liver function tests and providing supportive care are essential.
4. Rash: The patient has a morbiliform rash, which could be related to drug hypersensitivity or thymoma-associated autoimmunity. Supportive care is recommended.
5. Acute Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has developed acute lower extremity ed"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 46F met thymoma, pleural / peritoneal
   involvement, toxic hepatopathy p/w hypercarbic resp failure. Skin bx is
   c/w thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Febrile to 101.1,
   sputum +MRSA, requiring IVF for low BPs.
   Exam notable for Tm 101.1 BP 104/50 HR 68 RR 20 with sat 100 on PSV 5/5
   0.5 7.52/45/125. Opens eyes, follows commands, pupils responsive B.

   edema, rash. Labs notable for WBC 22K, HCT 23, K+ 4.0, Cr 0.4. R mid
   lung infiltrate.
   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure
   (restriction from mets, MRSA VAP, weakness, fluid overload) with PSV,
   sedation c propofol and low dose fentanyl patch. Will treat MRSA VAP
   with linezolid montherapy. Appears worse overall, febrile, borderline
   BP, unable to remove fluid. Toxic hepatopathy - stable, continue
   steroids for thymoma-associated autoimmune syndrome. TFs, PICC, art
   line, HSC, H2B. Patient is DNR (no shock / CPR, pressors OK); will
   speak with family today re goals of care. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above.
   ADDENDUM
 Family meeting via translator with patient
s husband, two
   brothers, sister-in-law and patient advocate x90 minutes. Multiple team
   members including SW present. Care reviewed in detail, including her
   worsening in terms of fever and lower BP today. Overall course and
   prognosis discussed in detail. Family expressed good understanding
   w/r/t the relentlessly progressive nature of her malignancy and the
   severity of her pneumonia. They all endorsed a desire to support her
   for a few more days to allow family to gather and to also allow her to
   live into the next Chinese New Year. It is clearly important for
   cultural reasons to work to honor this request. Assuming she can be
   supported until Thursday, we will then plan for terminal extubation.
   All aspects of this decision reviewed in detail, husband and brother
   were unanimous in their agreement with this plan of care.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 120 min
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old female with malignant thymoma admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and now with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including restriction from metastases, MRSA VAP, weakness, and fluid overload.
- The patient's condition has been worsening, with fever, low blood pressure, and an inability to remove fluid.
- The patient has toxic hepatopathy, which is stable, and is being treated with steroids for thymoma-associated autoimmune syndrome.
- The patient's goals of care will be discussed today, and the family is aware of the progressive nature of the patient's malignancy and the severity of the pneumonia.
- The family wants to support the patient for a few more days to allow family gathering and to live into the next Chinese New Year. The plan is to work towards honoring this request, assuming the patient can be supported until Thursday, followed by terminal extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has acute respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including MRSA VAP, weakness, and fluid overload. Continuing efforts to manage and improve respiratory function are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and the use of pressors may be required. Monitoring and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
3. Hepatitis: The patient has toxic hepatopathy, which needs"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now
   with VAP.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Multifactorial and now with MRSA VAP.  Sputum grows MSSA and bronch
   grows MRSA. Pt continues  clinically significantly worse and has been
   more dependent on ventilator support. Now switched to AC and appears
   comfortable. Unlikely to improve despite antibiotics and steroids.
   - Curbside ID whether worth nafcillin desensitization to cover MSSA
   - address goals of care
   - cont linezolid and steroids
   # Hypotension
 again multfactorial, possibly related to VAP leading to
   sepsis, possibly secondary to low albumin/oncotic pressure.
   Now stable.  Small response to IVF. Okay to start pressors for now.
   # Primary metabolic alkalosis
   Bicarb 35, pH 7.5. [**Month (only) 60**] have improved with NS boluses.
   --monitor
   --could consider diamox if worsens
   # Acute LUE edema: No DVT.
   - monitor
   #Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity
   (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  US w/
   patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- LFTs trending down
points toward hypersensitivity as improving with
   steroids, perhaps
   -- monitor
   # Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- supportive care
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting
   of hepatitis.
   - monitor Neurologic status
   - neuro recs, appreciate their input.
   # Thymoma: No active issues.
   # Goals of care
 decision is to continue max supportive care for now
   until middle of next week given Chinese new year and holiday week, then
   readdress terminal extubation and CMO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma. She was admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been clinically worsening and has developed multiorgan involvement, including hepatitis, rash, and acute left upper extremity edema. Her blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels. The patient also has a history of myasthenia gravis and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, which has led to intubation and mechanical ventilation. She has developed VAP caused by MSSA and MRSA.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, possibly related to VAP leading to sepsis. It was managed with intravenous fluids and pressors.
3. Primary metabolic alkalosis: The patient has primary metabolic alkalosis with a bicarbonate level of 35 and pH 7.5. She has received normal saline boluses to improve her condition.
4. Acute left upper extremity edema: The patient developed acute left upper extremity edema without evidence of deep vein thrombosis. It is being monitored.
5. Hepatitis: The patient has hepatitis, which could be drug-induced or associated with thymoma. Her liver function"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now
   with VAP.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Multifactorial and now with MRSA VAP.  Sputum grows MSSA and bronch
   grows MRSA. Unlikely to improve despite antibiotics and steroids.
   - cont linezolid and steroids
   # Constipation
   Unknown last bm
   --bowel regimen
   # Hypotension
 again multfactorial, possibly related to VAP leading to
   sepsis, possibly secondary to low albumin/oncotic pressure.
   -levophed for MAP <60 (has been on and off).
   # Acute LUE edema: No DVT.
   - monitor
   #Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity
   (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  US w/
   patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- LFTs trending down
points toward hypersensitivity as improving with
   steroids, perhaps
   -- monitor
   # Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- supportive care, added clobetasol cream
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting
   of hepatitis.
   - monitor Neurologic status
   # Thymoma: No active issues.
   # Goals of care
 decision is to continue max supportive care for now
   until middle of next week given Chinese new year and holiday week, then
   readdress terminal extubation and CMO

","The patient is a 46-year-old lady with a history of malignant thymoma, admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and now presenting with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition is described as multifactorial, including respiratory failure, constipation, hypotension, acute lower extremity edema, hepatitis, rash, myasthenia gravis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and thymoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and is caused by VAP. It may worsen if the infection does not respond to antibiotics or if there are complications such as ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Constipation: The patient has been experiencing constipation, which can lead to discomfort, distension, and potential complications like fecal impaction or perforation if not managed properly.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, possibly related to VAP leading to sepsis, possibly secondary to low albumin/oncotic pressure. It needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate fluids and vasopressors.

4. Acute lower extremity edema: The patient has developed acute lower extremity edema, which may be due to venous stasis or other factors. It should be monitored for signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or"

   46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening
   shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now with VAP.
   1. Respiratory failure: multifactorial and now with MRSA and MSSA VAP.
   WBC slowly coming down. Tolerating PSV again today.
   - continue linezolid for MSSA in sputum and MRSA in BAL
   2.  Hypotension:  now off levohed; was on low-dose yeterday, likely [**3-17**]
   increasing propofol dose.  Treating VAP as above.
   3. Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan
   autoimmunity (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI
   involvement).  US w/ patent portal/hepatic veins. LFTs trending down
   slowly.
   - monitor LFTs
   4.  Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   - sarna lotion, bendaryl prn itching
   - add clobetasol cream
   5.  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.
   6. SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath. She is intubated and has worsening hepatitis, now with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by MRSA and MSSA. Her white blood cell count is slowly decreasing, and she is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) again today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and the presence of VAP increases the risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient is off levophed, but there is a mention of low-dose yesterday. This could indicate ongoing issues with maintaining blood pressure.
3. Hepatitis: The patient has drug-induced hepatitis or thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) is important to track the progression of hepatitis.
4. Rash: The patient has a morbiliform rash, which is associated with the same autoimmune phenomenon as hepatitis. Management includes using sarna lotion, bendaryl for itching, and adding clobetasol cream.
5. Myasthenia gravis: The patient has been in remission according to the neurologist's assessment.
6. Subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): A CT angiography of the head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci with high-density material. The cause of SAH is unclear"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubation, and worsening hepatitis. She now presents with MRSA and MSSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's white blood cell count is slowly decreasing, and she is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) today. She has hypotension and was previously on levophed but is now off. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down slowly, indicating improvement. She also has a rash, which is likely due to drug-induced hepatitis or thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. The patient has myasthenia gravis in remission and a subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage. The family has decided to keep the patient on full code status and plans to address terminal extubation and comfort measures only (CMO) after the Chinese New Year holiday. The patient remains DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes and now with MRSA and MSSA VAP.
2. Hypotension and potential need for vasopressor support.
3. Hepatitis, possibly drug-induced or associated with thymoma.
4. Rash, potentially due to drug-induced liver injury or thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity.
5. Myasthenia gravis, currently in remission.

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening
   shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now with VAP.
   1. Respiratory failure: multifactorial and now with MRSA and MSSA VAP.
   WBC stable since yesterday.  Now on AC as low VTs on PSV.
   - continue linezolid
   2.  Hypotension:  now back on levophed at low dose, likely [**3-17**]
   increasing propofol dose.  Treating VAP as above.
   3. Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan
   autoimmunity (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI
   involvement).  US w/ patent portal/hepatic veins.
   - monitor LFTs
   4.  Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   - saran lotion, add bendaryl prn itching
   5.  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   6. SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting
   of hepatitis.
   - monitor Neurologic status
   - neuro recs, appreciate their input.
   7. Goals of care
 per family meeting yesterday, full go until middle
   of next week to attempt to get the patient through the Chinese new year
   holiday.  Then, will readdress terminal extubation and CMO.  Remains
   DNR.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma who was admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and now presents with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has hypotension, hepatitis, rash, myasthenia gravis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient's goals of care are to keep her alive until the middle of next week, attempting to get her through the Chinese New Year holiday, after which terminal extubation and comfort measures only (CMO) will be considered. She remains do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to VAP. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and potential development of other infections or complications related to mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage. There is a risk of septic shock if the underlying infection is not adequately controlled.

3. Hepatitis: The patient's hepatitis may progress, resulting in liver dysfunction and potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.

4. Rash: The patient's rash may worsen or new rashes may develop, indicating a possible autoimmune response or drug reaction.

   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now
   with VAP.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial (metastatic thymoma w/ pleural
   mets, infection, and possible GVHD like pulmonary disease).  Patient
   now with MRSA VAP.  Sputum grows MSSA and bronch grows MRSA.
   - cont linezolid and steroids
   - f/u blood cx
   # Constipation: Resolved w/ bowel regimen.  Can change to prn as
   patient stooling continuously.
   # Hypotension: again multfactorial (infectious/adrenal insuf).
   Levophed as needed for MAP <60 (has been off for few days).
   #Heptatitis: Likely thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see
   rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement) vs drug induced.
   US w/ patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- LFTs trending down
points toward hypersensitivity as improving with
   steroids, perhaps
   # Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- supportive care, continue cream
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci w/
   high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting
   of hepatitis.
   - monitor Neurologic status
   # Thymoma: No active issues.
   # Goals of care
 decision is to continue max supportive care for now
   until middle of next week given Chinese new year and holiday week, then
   readdress terminal extubation and CMO

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma, who was admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath and intubated. She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to metastatic thymoma with pleural metastasis, infection, and possible GVHD-like pulmonary disease. She also has MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hepatitis, peripheral edema, alteration in nutrition, ineffective coping, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including metastatic thymoma with pleural metastasis, infection, and possible GVHD-like pulmonary disease. The patient has been intubated and is receiving supportive care with linezolid and steroids.

2. MRSA VAP: The patient has developed MRSA VAP, as evidenced by sputum growing MSSA and bronchial cultures growing MRSA. She is being treated with linezolid.

3. Hepatitis: The patient has hepatitis, which is likely thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity or drug-induced. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, indicating improvement with steroids.

4. Rash: The patient has a morbiliform rash, which is likely related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Supportive care is being provided.

5. Myasthenia Gravis: The patient's myasthenia gr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including metastatic thymoma with pleural metastasis, infection, and possible graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) like pulmonary disease. The patient is unlikely to improve despite antibiotics and steroids.

The patient's hypotension is also multifactorial, including infectious causes and adrenal insufficiency. Levophed has been used as needed for mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 60. 

The patient has hepatitis, which is likely thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity or drug-induced. Liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, indicating improvement with steroids.

The patient has a rash, which is also likely related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Supportive care is being provided.

The patient has myasthenia gravis, which is currently in remission. Neurological improvement has been observed, and a neurologist is involved in the patient's care.

The patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head. The cause of the SAH is unclear,"

","The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now with VAP. She has several medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, constipation, hepatitis, rash, myasthenia gravis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and thymoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including VAP. The presence of MRSA VAP increases the risk of worsening respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient has recurrent episodes of hypotension, which can be attributed to various factors such as VAP leading to sepsis, low albumin/oncotic pressure, or the use of vasodilators. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Peripheral Edema: The patient has acute left upper extremity edema, possibly due to factors like venous insufficiency or fluid overload. Monitoring for signs of worsening edema and managing fluid balance is essential.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: Due to prolonged bed rest and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular turning and pressure area care are necessary to prevent further complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of malignant thymoma. She was admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubation, and worsening hepatitis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute on chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage, peripheral edema, ineffective coping, hepatitis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, constipation, and rash.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite antibiotics and steroids, there is unlikely to be improvement.

2. Constipation: The patient's last bowel movement is unknown, indicating the possibility of constipation. A bowel regimen should be initiated.

3. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be related to VAP leading to sepsis or secondary to low albumin/oncotic pressure. Levophed is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 60.

4. Acute LUE Edema: The patient has acute lower extremity edema but without deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Monitoring for signs of DVT and considering appropriate interventions is necessary.

5. Hepatitis: The patient has worsening hepatitis, which may be drug-induced or associated with thymoma-related multiorgan autoimmunity. Monitoring liver function tests (LFT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubation, and worsening hepatitis. She is now experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient's white blood cell count is slowly decreasing. She is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) again today.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including VAP caused by MRSA and MSSA. She will continue receiving linezolid for MSSA in sputum and MRSA in bronchoalveolar lavage.
2. Hypotension: The patient is now off levohed, but was on low-dose yesterday. It is likely that the propofol dose will be increased. Treatment for VAP will be continued as mentioned above.
3. Hepatitis: The patient may have drug-induced hepatitis or thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. There is a rise in liver function tests (LFTs), morbiliform rash, and gastrointestinal involvement. A US with patent portal/hepatic veins has been performed. LFTs are trending down slowly.
   - Monitor LFTs.
4. Rash: The patient has a thymoma-associated"

","The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, hepatitis, rash, myasthenia gravis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and goals of care.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to her malignant thymoma and worsening shortness of breath. If left untreated or uncontrolled, this condition may lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory arrest.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been off levohed and is now on a low dose of propofol. If her blood pressure drops significantly or if she develops septic shock, it could lead to cardiovascular collapse and death.

3. Hepatitis: The patient is showing signs of hepatitis, which could be drug-induced or associated with her thymoma. If the hepatitis progresses, it may result in liver dysfunction and failure, leading to complications such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and increased risk of infections.

4. Rash: The patient has a morbiliform rash, which is likely due to an autoimmune phenomenon related to her thymoma. If the rash spreads or if she develops an allergic reaction to any medication, it could potentially lead to anaphylaxis"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening
   shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now with VAP.
   1. Respiratory failure: multifactorial and now with MRSA and MSSA VAP.
   WBC slowly coming down. Tolerating PSV again today.
   - continue linezolid for MSSA in sputum and MRSA in BAL
   2.  Hypotension:  now off levohed; was on low-dose on Sat likely [**3-17**]
   increasing propofol dose.  Treating VAP as above.
   3. Heptatitis: Drug induced vs thymoma associated multiorgan
   autoimmunity (can see rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI
   involvement).  US w/ patent portal/hepatic veins. Bilis trending down
   slowly.
   - monitor LFTs
   4.  Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   - sarna lotion, bendaryl prn itching, clobetasol cream
   5.  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.
   6. SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci
   w/ high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting
   of hepatitis.
   - monitor Neurologic status
   - neuro recs, appreciate their input.
   7. Goals of care
 per family meeting Friday, full go until middle of
   next week to attempt to get the patient through the Chinese new year
   holiday (middle of this week).  Then, will readdress terminal
   extubation and CMO.  Remains DNR.

","The patient is a 46-year-old lady admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and now with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of malignant thymoma and is currently on multiple medications including propofol, linezolid, and other antibiotics for VAP. The patient also has hepatitis, a rash, myasthenia gravis, and subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's goals of care are to remain on full nutrition and continue with DNR status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory failure due to VAP, further hepatic dysfunction, progression of the rash and associated autoimmune phenomenon, worsening myasthenia gravis symptoms, and potential neurological decline due to the subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Based on the information provided, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction including respiratory, hepatic, and potential neurological involvement. Close monitoring and management of these organ systems are crucial to prevent further deterioration."

 LEUKOCYTOSIS
   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now
   with VAP.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial (metastatic thymoma w/ pleural
   mets, infection, and possible GVHD like pulmonary disease).  Patient
   now with MRSA VAP.  Sputum grows MSSA and bronch grows MRSA.
   - cont linezolid and steroids
   - started linezolid [**2122-3-25**], last dose on [**2122-4-2**]
   - f/u blood cx
   # Anasarca: Pt 14L positive since admission, likely secondary to third
   spacing.
   - Try to limit fluid intake
   # Constipation: s/p disempaction.
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: again multfactorial (infectious/adrenal insuf).
   Levophed as needed for MAP <60 (has been off for few days).
   #Heptatitis: Likely thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see
   rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement) vs drug induced.
   US w/ patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- LFTs trending down
points toward hypersensitivity as improving with
   steroids, perhaps
   # Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- supportive care, continue cream
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci w/
   high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting
   of hepatitis.
   - monitor Neurologic status
   # Thymoma: No active issues.
   # Goals of care
 decision is to continue max supportive care for now
   until middle of next week given Chinese new year and holiday week, then
   readdress terminal extubation and CMO on Wednesday

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as metastatic thymoma with pleural metastases, infection, and possible graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-like pulmonary disease. She has been on linezolid for MRSA VAP since [2122-3-25] and will continue until [2122-4-2].

The patient also has anasarca, likely secondary to third spacing, and hypotension, which is multifactorial including infectious and adrenal insufficiency causes. Levophed has been used as needed for mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60.

The patient has hepatitis, which is likely thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity or drug-induced. US with patent portal/hepatic veins has been done, and liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down.

The patient also has a morbiliform rash, which is consistent with thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity resembling GVHD. Supportive care and cream have been provided.

Myasthenia gravis has been in remission, and the patient's neuromuscular function has improved. Neurology"

","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma, admitted for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. The patient now presents with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as evidenced by sputum growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bronchial samples also positive for MRSA. 

The patient has been on linezolid, an antibiotic effective against MRSA, and steroids. Blood cultures are being followed up. 

The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including infectious and possible adrenal insufficiency. Levophed has been used as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

The patient's hepatitis is likely thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, which is supported by the improvement in liver function tests (LFTs) with steroids. This autoimmune phenomenon resembles graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

The patient's rash is also attributed to the same autoimmune condition. Supportive care and cream application are being continued.

Myasthenia gravis, previously uncontrolled, has shown improvement, and neurologic involvement is ongoing.

Subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected, with obliteration of the left frontal sulci seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head. The high red blood cell count seen on lumbar puncture (LP) supports this diagnosis. The"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes including metastatic thymoma with pleural metastasis, infection, and possible GVHD-like pulmonary disease. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and MSSA in sputum cultures. Linezolid and steroids have been continued, and blood cultures are being followed up.

The patient also has constipation, which has resolved with a bowel regimen, but can be changed to prn as the patient is experiencing continuous diarrhea. Hypotension is another issue, likely due to infectious or adrenal insufficiency causes. Levophed is being used as needed for mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60.

Hepatitis is suspected to be either thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity or drug-induced. US with patent portal/hepatic veins has been done, and liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down. A rash is also present, which could be related to the same autoimmune phenomenon seen in patients with extensive thymoma, resembling GVHD.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) has been in remission, and neurologic improvement has been observed. Neurological involvement is ongoing. The patient also has subacute chronic subarachnoid hemorrh"

   A 46 year old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis now
   with VAP.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial (metastatic thymoma w/ pleural
   mets, infection, and possible GVHD like pulmonary disease).  Patient
   now with MRSA VAP.  Sputum grows MSSA and bronch grows MRSA.
   - cont linezolid and steroids
   - f/u blood cx
   # Anasarca: Pt 14L positive since admission, now requiring pressors.
   # Constipation: s/p disempaction.
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: again multfactorial (infectious/adrenal insuf).
   Levophed as needed for MAP <60 (has been off for few days).
   #Heptatitis: Likely thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see
   rise in LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement) vs drug induced.
   US w/ patent portal/hepatic veins.
   -- LFTs trending down
points toward hypersensitivity as improving with
   steroids, perhaps
   # Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- supportive care, continue cream
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci w/
   high-density material likely due to subacute chronic subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, which is consistent w/ high RBC count seen on LP.  Unclear
   inciting [**Doctor Last Name **] may be platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy in setting
   of hepatitis.
   - monitor Neurologic status
   # Thymoma: No active issues.
   # Goals of care
 decision is to continue max supportive care for now
   until middle of next week given Chinese new year and holiday week, then
   readdress terminal extubation and CMO

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and now presents with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has anasarca, constipation, hypotension, hepatitis, rash, myasthenia gravis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. She is currently on multiple medications, including propofol, famotidine, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and linezolid. Her vital signs are stable, but she has leukocytosis and impaired skin integrity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of malignant thymoma with pleural metastasis, infection, and possible GVHD-like pulmonary disease. She is now diagnosed with MRSA VAP. Multifactorial respiratory failure is likely, and the patient requires continued respiratory support and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Anasarca: The patient has edema and peripheral alteration in nutrition, indicating possible anasarca. This can be managed by monitoring fluid balance and providing appropriate nutritional support.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including infectious causes and possible adrenal insufficiency. Pressors may be required, and further evaluation of adrenal function is needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma, admitted for worsening hepatitis, sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She remains off pressors and continues to have diarrhea, leading to disimpaction. The patient has several medical conditions including respiratory failure, hepatitis, rash, myasthenia gravis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Her goals of care are to remain full code until the middle of next week to attempt to get the patient through the Chinese New Year holiday, then readdress terminal extubation and comfort measures only (CMO). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 133/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelets, with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Other lab results are within normal range. The patient has been receiving linezolid for MSSA"

   -- LFTs trending down
points toward hypersensitivity as improving with
   steroids, perhaps
   # Rash: thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity (can see rise in
   LFTs, morbiliform rash, and GI involvement).  This autoimmune
   phenomenon has been reported in patients with extensive thymoma,
   pathophysiology resembles GVHD.
   -- supportive care, continue sarna/clobetasol
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: per neuro, has been in remission.  NIF has
   improved. Neuro is involved.
   #SAH:  CTA head demonstrates obliteration of the left frontal sulci w/

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis. The patient's medical history includes anasarca (likely secondary to third spacing), constipation, hypotension (multifactorial), hepatitis (possibly thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity or drug-induced), rash (thymoma associated multiorgan autoimmunity), myasthenia gravis (in remission), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (chronic subacute).

The patient is currently on several medications, including linezolid, steroids, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and propofol. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 106/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 40.8 thousand cells per microliter, elevated hematocrit levels ranging from 27.6% to 29.3%, slightly decreased platelet count ranging from 220 to 147 thousand cells per microliter, and various abnormalities in liver function tests.

The patient has multiple potential medical complications, including respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as metastatic thymoma with pleural metastases, infection, and"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, intubated, and worsening hepatitis.
- The patient has respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as metastatic thymoma with pleural metastasis, infection, and possible GVHD-like pulmonary disease.
- The patient has anasarca, which is likely secondary to third spacing and is being monitored.
- The patient has constipation and was given disempaction. KUB is limited but no obstruction is seen.
- The patient has hypotension, which is multifactorial (infectious/adrenal insufficiency). Levophed is used as needed for MAP <60.
- The patient has hepatitis, which is likely thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity or drug-induced. US shows patent portal/hepatic veins, and LFTs are trending down.
- The patient has a rash, which is also associated with thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Supportive care is being provided.
- The patient has myasthenia gravis, which is in remission.
- The patient has subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is monitored by the neurology team.
- The patient's goals of care include discussing terminal extubation with the family and social worker.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and being treated in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. The patient has multiple medical issues and complications, including respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hepatitis, rash, and myasthenia gravis.

Respiratory failure is multifactorial, possibly caused by a thymoma with extensive pleural disease/restriction and GVHD from thymoma-related autoimmune processes, as well as MRSA and MSSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to continue day 8-20 linezolid for MSSA in sputum and MRSA in BAL, administer steroids for presumed GVHD of lung, and continue pressure support ventilation (PSV)/assistant controlled ventilation (AC) for now with a plan for terminal extubation later this week.

Leukocytosis is present with a white blood cell count of 40.8, which may be due to infection, steroids, or a reactive component. The patient remains alert and hemodynamically stable, with no evidence of Clostridium difficile infection. The differential count should be followed, and urine analysis and culture should be checked.

Hepatitis is suspected to be drug-induced or related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. An ultrasound showed patent portal/hepatic veins, and bilirubin levels are trending down slowly.

A rash is present, which is likely related to thymoma"

   Addendum
   I met with pt
s family along with ICU team and [**Doctor Last Name 39**] from social
   work.  Pt
s children were present at family/husband request.  We
   discussed pt
s current status (reversible problems have been reversed)
   and plan for terminal extubation tomorrow, in line with pt
s expressed
   wishes.  This will take place after her older brother [**Name (NI) **] arrives from
   [**Name (NI) 652**].  All questions were answered.  Family understands that we will
   not reintubate, but rather will transition to aggressive comfort and
   that pt will likely expire without ventilatory support.  We are
   hopefull that she may be able to communicate at least briefly with her
   family, but stressed that need to assure pt comfort (medications) may
   prevent this. After this meeting, our team along with pt
s family
   relayed this information directly to the pt, who is intubated but alert
   and awake, and expressed her understanding.
   Additional crit care time spent in meetings and discussion:  70 min
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with malignant thymoma who has been admitted to the ICU for worsening hepatitis, sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure due to extensive pleural disease from the thymoma, restrictive physiology, possible graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) from an autoimmune process related to the thymoma, and MRSA and MSSA VAP. Despite treatment for reversible issues, the patient remains ventilator-dependent.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is multifactorial and could be due to infection, steroids, or a reactive component. The patient's condition is stable, but further monitoring and reevaluation are needed.

3. Hepatitis: The patient has hepatitis, which may be drug-induced or associated with thymoma-related multiorgan autoimmunity. A liver ultrasound shows patent portal/hepatic veins, and liver enzyme levels are slowly trending down, possibly due to steroid effect.

4. Rash: The patient has a rash that is likely associated with thymoma-related multiorgan autoimmunity. Skin care measures, such as sarna lotion, benadryl for pruritus, and clobetasol cream, are being used to manage the rash.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of metastatic thymoma, pleural disease, and suspected GVHD from an autoimmune process related to the thymoma. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including MRSA and MSSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids, the patient remains ventilator-dependent. The patient's current condition includes constipation, rash, peripheral edema, altered nutrition, ineffective coping, hepatitis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing despite treatment, indicating a high risk of continued ventilator dependence and potential complications such as pneumonia or further deterioration in lung function.
2. Infection: The presence of MRSA and MSSA VAP increases the risk of infection-related complications, including sepsis and septic shock.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to increased susceptibility to pressure ulcers, infections, and compromised wound healing.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension poses a risk for inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Hepatitis: The patient's hepatitis indicates potential liver dysfunction and increases the risk of complications such as jaundice, coagulopathy, and impaired metabolism of medications.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-inch tall individual who weighs 54.6 kg and was admitted with a history of thymoma and pleural disease. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's medical history also includes myasthenia gravis, which is currently in remission.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including hepatitis, leukocytosis, rash, constipation, peripheral edema, alteration in nutrition, ineffective coping, and impaired skin integrity. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving metastatic thymoma, pleural disease, possible GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) from an autoimmune process related to thymoma, MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids, the patient remains dependent on the ventilator.

The leukocytosis is associated with a urinary tract infection (UTI), and the patient's Foley catheter needs to be changed. The hepatitis may be drug-induced or related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, and an ultrasound has confirmed patent portal/hepatic veins. The rash is also believed to be related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity.

The patient's myasthenia gravis is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure. He has metastatic thymoma with extensive pleural involvement, and there are concerns about GVHD due to an autoimmune process related to the thymoma. The patient also has MRSA and MSSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids, the patient remains ventilator-dependent.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including metastatic thymoma, pleural disease, potential GVHD from autoimmune process, and VAP caused by MRSA and MSSA. The patient remains dependent on the ventilator despite treatment.
2. Hepatitis: The patient has hepatitis, which could be drug-induced or associated with thymoma-related multiorgan autoimmunity. The condition is improving.
3. Rash: The patient has a rash due to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Treatment includes clobetasol, sarna, and benadryl as needed.
4. Constipation: The patient has constipation, and the bowel regimen should be continued. The patient is currently stooling.
5. Myasthenia Gravis (MG): The patient's MG is in remission, according to the neurologist.
6. Thymoma: The patient has metastatic thymoma with extensive pleural involvement, and no further treatment options are available"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes factors such as a thymoma with extensive pleural disease and restrictive physiology, potential GVHD from thymoma-related autoimmune process, and MRSA and MSSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been treated for reversible issues, but remains dependent on the ventilator.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which is multifactorial and may be due to infection, steroids, or reactive component. Clostridium difficile infection has been ruled out.

Hepatitis is present, which could be drug-induced or related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. A liver ultrasound showed patent portal/hepatic veins, and the lactic acid level is trending down slowly, possibly due to steroid effect.

The patient also has a rash, which is likely related to thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Skin care measures have been implemented.

Myasthenia gravis is in remission according to the neurologist's assessment.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU. The patient is critically ill, and the healthcare team is discussing goals of care and plans for terminal extubation with the family."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt with advanced met thymoma with extensive pulmonary/pleural
   involvement as well as suspected GVHD from thymoma-related autoimmune
   process effecting lung, skin and possibly liver. She has completed
   course of linezolid for VAP (MRSA/MSSA) and has been receiving steroids
   for auto-immune process.  We have treated reversible issues, but pt
   remains vent dependent. We have had extensive family meetings and
   family understands and is in full agreement with planned terminal
   extubation and transition to aggressive comfort which is in line with
   pt
s wishes.  Family is gathered at bedside.

","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma, admitted to the hospital for worsening hepatitis, sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

The patient required the use of levophed briefly overnight. Her allergies include penicillins and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, which caused facial rash. The last dose of antibiotics, linezolid, was given at 12:02 PM. The patient is receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/57 mmHg to 126/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. 

The patient's current weight is 54.6 kg, an increase from the admission weight of 45.9 kg.
