   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   .
   # Chest pain. Differential includes ACS, cocaine induced chest pain,
   pericarditis versus costacondiritis. Unlikely ACS as recent cath [**2155**]
   no CAD (however could be cocaine induced ischemia), no acute changes on
   EKG and was recently admitted with negative rule out. Pain is not
   positional and no changes on EKG to suggest pericarditis. Pain is not
   reproducible to palpation to suggest costachondritis. Most likely
   cocaine induced chest pain based on recent use and prior history.
   - ROMI
   - Continue statin; hold ACEI with increased K. Received ASA by EMS,
   continue 81 mg daily
   - BP control/decrease of myocardial demand with HD in AM
   - For pain control dilaudid, percocet and benzodiazepines prn
   - Encourage cessation of cocaine abuse
   .
   # Hypoxia. Volume overload with pulmonary edema and effusions in
   setting of not getting HD. No evidence of pneumonia currently, though
   does have productive cough. History most consistent with volume
   overload, unlikely PE.
   - HD in AM
   - Attempt to wean off 100% NRB
   - Can repeat CXR after diuresis if still with hypoxia or cough
   - Diuresis with lasix
   - Hold off on antibiotics as no fever, no leukocytosis; likely volume
   overload given clinical history
   .
   # Tachycardia/Aflutter. Patient with baseline Aflutter; currently
   demonstrating 2:1 conduction. Patient required diltiazem 10 mg IV for
   HR 170s.
   - Avoid BBs due to history of cocaine use.
   - Convert long acting po diltiazem to short acting
   - If poorly controlled IV diltiazem or drip prn
   - Cannot anticoagulate long term given GIBs per past notes..
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. With ESRD and poor adherence to HD. No peaked t waves
   on EKG.  Received dose of Kayexelate.
   - Monitor on tele.
   - HD in AM.
   - If ECG changes (peaked Ts) develop, give calcium, insulin and D50
   - Glucose control to encourage intracellular entry
   - Hold ACEI.
   .
   # Hypertension: Secondary to volume overload.
   - Avoid BB due to cocaine use
   - Diltiazem 60 mg QID
   - If poorly controlled 190s or greater start nitro drip
   .
   # ESRD on HD. Overdue for HD as above.
   - HD in early AM.
   - Managment of K.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with shortness of breath and chest pain after missing his scheduled hemodialysis session. The patient has been admitted multiple times for similar complaints.

24-hour events:
- The patient had tachycardia and hypertension that responded to intravenous diltiazem.
- He experienced desaturation to 84% on 4L nasal cannula around 0500, which improved with high flow nebulizers. Renal services were notified for emergent dialysis.
- The patient received dialysis in the morning of [**2-12**].

Current assessment and plan:
1. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain is most likely due to cocaine-induced chest pain, considering his recent use and prior history. No evidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pericarditis was found.
   - ROMI (run-of-mission) and continue statin therapy. Hold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) due to increased potassium levels. Continue aspirin (ASA) at a dose of 81 mg daily.
   - Control blood pressure and decrease myocardial demand with hemodialysis in the morning.
   - Provide pain control with hydromorphone ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with shortness of breath and chest pain in the setting of cocaine abuse and missed hemodialysis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain may be due to cocaine-induced chest pain rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, it is important to monitor for any changes in symptoms or EKG findings that could indicate ACS or pericarditis.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has volume overload with pulmonary edema and effusions, which is likely causing the hypoxia. Hemodialysis is recommended to remove excess fluid, and the patient should be encouraged to wean off the 100% NRB.

3. Tachycardia/Aflutter: The patient has a baseline atrial flutter and is currently demonstrating 2:1 conduction. Diltiazem was given IV for a heart rate of 170s. Avoiding beta-blockers due to cocaine use is advised.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, likely due to ESRD and poor adherence to HD. Monitoring on tele, HD in AM, and administration of kayexalate are recommended."

   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   # Chest pain
   Likely angina with some myocardial ischemia, not severe enough for
   enzyme leak. Although PNA unlikely, may be pleuritic component (less
   likely)
   - Continue statin; hold ACEI with increased K. Received ASA by EMS,
   continue 81 mg daily
   - BP control/decrease of myocardial demand
   - For pain control dilaudid, percocet and benzodiazepines prn
   - Encourage cessation of cocaine abuse
   # Hypoxia
   Missed HD with significant volume overload. Superimposed infection not
   obvious on CXR, but possible given rising WBC and productive cough. PE
   on differential but alternate explanations adequate.
   - HD and diuresis
   - Attempt to wean respiratory support (no n.c.)
   - Hold off on antibiotics as no fever, no leukocytosis; likely volume
   overload given clinical history
   # Tachycardia/Aflutter
   Patient with baseline Aflutter; often demonstrating 2:1 conduction.
   Patient required diltiazem 10 mg IV for HR 170s.
   - Avoid BBs due to history of cocaine use.
   - Convert back to long-acting dilt. on discharge
   - Cannot anticoagulate long term given GIBs per past notes.
   # Hyperkalemia/hyperphsophatemia
   With ESRD and poor adherence to HD.
   - Tele for now (and likely on floor depending on events in record)
   - Continue HD
   - If ECG changes (peaked Ts) develop, give calcium, insulin and D50
   - Glucose control to encourage intracellular entry
   - Hold ACEI
   # Hypertension
   Secondary to volume overload.
   - Avoid BB due to cocaine use
   - Diltiazem 60 mg QID
   - If poorly controlled 190s or greater start nitro drip
   # ESRD on HD
   Overdue for HD as above.
   - HD again today
   - Managment of K
   - Continue renagel/nephrocaps/renal diet

- 4.7 liters off on nasal canula
- Bilateral pulmonary infiltrate on repeat chest X-ray (CXR)
- Trending up white count, expected to follow with fever
- Allergies to morphine, causing itchiness
- Last dose of antibiotics was on [date]
- Infusions include heparin sodium for prophylaxis
- Other ICU medications are mentioned, but specific names are not provided
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below
- Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and blood products
- Lab results indicate elevated WBC, creatinine, potassium, and low hemoglobin levels
- ECG shows right bundle branch block (RBBB) and biphasic Ps TWI in VI, VII
- Assessment and plan include multiple diagnoses and treatment recommendations

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

Physical examination findings include bilateral pulmonary ronchi, tachycardia, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs or rubs, mid-neck jugular venous distention (JVD), soft and mildly distended abdomen, well-perfused extremities with 2+ pulses, no clubbing or cyanosis, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination reveals asterixis.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he is expected to continue receiving ICU care."
