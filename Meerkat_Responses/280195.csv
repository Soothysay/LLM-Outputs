 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 64M with quadraplegia, multiple prior
   infections and recent lower GIB presents with fevers and hypotension
   .
   # Hypotension.  Pt does have autonomic dysfuntion at baseline, but
   given the severity and refractoriness of this hypotension combined with
   a fever, this would be a diagnosis of exclusion in a setting where
   there are multiple more likely diagnoses. Ddx includes, sepsis, with
   either bacterial showering from nephrostomy tube, or introduction of
   skin flora during procedure.  Pt's infectious history is complicated as
   he appears to have relapsing UTIs despite having completed a course of
   appropriate abx. The presence of an obstructing stone is likely
   etiology for persistent infections. Pt now s/p decompression with
   nephrostomy tube. Also high on ddx is acute bleed, pt has both h/o
   recent GIB with colonoscopy and biopsy as well as the nephrostomy tube
   placement.  The sedation he received for the colonoscopy in addition to
   his BB, lack of PO intake x ~3 days and percocet he received in the
   afternoon may have played a role in the severity of his hypotension.
   His lactate and UOP are reassuringly normal at this time after fluid
   rescusitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with quadriplegia, multiple prior infections, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with fevers and hypotension. The assessment includes anemia due to blood loss, hypotension not in shock, and potential sepsis or acute bleed as possible diagnoses. The patient has a history of relapsing urinary tract infections despite completing appropriate antibiotic treatment, and the presence of an obstructing stone is likely the cause of persistent infections. He underwent decompression with a nephrostomy tube placement. Other medical conditions include a colon mass, obstructing ureteral stone, hyponatremia, hypertension, depression/anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea, and fluid-electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of infections, recent procedure, and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute bleed: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and recent colonoscopy/biopsy may increase the risk of acute bleed, which can cause hypotension and shock.
3. Kidney stone complications: The obstructing ureteral stone may lead to further infections and potential kidney damage if not managed appropriately.
4. Hyponatremia: Monitoring and managing this electrolyte imbalance is important to avoid neurological complications.
5. Hypertension: It is necessary to hold anti-hypertensive medications while the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with quadriplegia, multiple prior infections, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding who presents with fevers and hypotension. The patient has been treated for possible infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is awaiting urine culture results. The patient's blood pressure has been stable off levophed, and he has received 3 liters of IV fluids and 2 units of packed red blood cells. A CT abdomen/pelvis has been ordered to evaluate for occult retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's sedatives have been held until blood pressure normalizes, and a percutaneous nephrostomy tube has been placed for an obstructing ureteral stone. The patient's hyponatremia is at baseline, and he will be monitored. Other ongoing issues include hypertension, depression/anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperkalemia, and access through a right internal jugular presep catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections and is currently being treated for a possible urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the urine culture results are pending. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed is crucial.
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has improved with fluid resuscitation and the discontinuation of levophed. However, close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters is necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with quadriplegia, multiple prior infections, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with fevers and hypotension. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized off levophed. He is being treated for infection with Zosyn and Daptomycin to cover for gram negatives and staph, respectively. The source of the infection is likely urinary. Surveillance cultures are being obtained, and the patient is awaiting further recommendations from the ID team.

The patient has a history of colon mass, and a colonic biopsy is pending. He is awaiting management recommendations from the GI team. The patient also has an obstructing ureteral stone, for which he underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. His hyponatremia is at baseline, and he will be monitored accordingly. His hypertension will be managed while he is hypotensive.

The patient is also being treated for depression/anxiety with fluoxetine, obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP at home, and has a femoral head necrosis. Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots for DVT and stress ulcer prevention with pantoprazole. The patient's family has been informed and can be reached at [phone numbers].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state and urinary catheter.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with quadriplegia, multiple prior infections, and a recent lower gastrointestinal bleed. He presents with fevers and hypotension. The patient's blood pressure has been stable off of levophed. The assessment and plan include treating the infection broadly with Zosyn to cover for gram negatives, likely of urinary source, and adding daptomycin to cover for both staph and VRE given the patient's history of positive swab. The patient is also awaiting urine culture results from the nephrostomy tube as well as other surveillance cultures. The CT abdomen/pelvis showed no acute bleed.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with quadriplegia, multiple prior infections, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with fevers and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/65 mmHg to 77/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, no murmurs on cardiac examination, and abdominal distention with a soft abdomen. There is no edema or changes in extremities. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, sodium of 134 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 80 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 150 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, anemia secondary to blood loss, and hypotension not in shock. He has been treated with antibiotics to cover gram-negative bacteria, likely of urinary source, and daptomycin to cover for both Staphylococcus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus given his positive swab history.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with quadriplegia, multiple prior infections, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
- He presents with fevers and hypotension, which are likely multifactorial due to blood loss and infection.
- Blood cultures show Enterococcus and Staphylococcus in the urine.
- The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn) to cover gram-negative bacteria, and daptomycin to cover both Staphylococcus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
- Other medications include sertraline (Zoloft) for depression/anxiety, metoprolol for hypertension, and fluoxetine for depression.
- The patient has a colon mass and obstructing ureteral stone, both of which require further evaluation and treatment.
- He also has hyponatremia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and is at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stress ulcers.
- The patient's family has been informed and is available for communication.
- The patient's current condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has Enterococcus and Staphylococcus infections, which need to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be"
