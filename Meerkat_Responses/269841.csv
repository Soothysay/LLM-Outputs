   Assessment and Plan
   72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD,
   recurrent cellulitis; admit with acute on chronic altered mental status
   and pneumonia.
   .
   # Pneumonia.  Fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.  O2 sats
   excellent and hemodynamically stable.  CAP vs. HCAP (lives in nursing
   home and frequent hospital exposure) vs. aspiration.  Localized likely
   to RLL.  Also consider atypicals including legionella, virals.
   - vanc/zosyn/levoflox for atypicals
   - send legionella urinary Ag
   - Sputum culture if can produce
   - f/u blood cultures
   - consider bronch if not improving
   - speech and swallow for ?aspiration
   - consider tap of R effusion if large enough (eval with ultrasound vs.
   decub film).
   .
   # Fever.  Pneumonia as above; also consider other infectious sources
   (urine, c.diff/stool, flu, other abdominal).
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics to start; f/u culture data
   including urine, blood, c.diff, virals.
   -          f/u final read of abdominal CT
   .
   # Altered mental status.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Was functioning and working as
   a lawyer a little more than one year ago.  Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] as a
   delirium, perhaps ?med related.  Agitation today with increased
   lethargy in past couple days reported.  CT head without acute process.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease (though unclear if truly cirrhotic physiology).
   WBC count does not seem high enough to induce stasis type of delta MS.
   -          antipsychotics as needed, IV if not tolerating PO or not
   able to safely swallow. Prefer to avoid benzos, but per family haldol
   makes him hallucinate and only ativan works.  Restraints prn to prevent
   pulling tubes.
   -          ?trial of lactulose given liver disease.
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          Hold all PO meds for now; speech and swallow if mental
   status not improving or aspiration an ongoing concern.
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   -          Fall precautions.
   .
   # Cellulitis.  Bilat LEs with erythema, edema, warmth.  Scabs over legs
   as above.  Has bad PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound
   consult.  Last received clinda during last admit in late [**Month (only) 1148**].
   -          antibiotic course as above.
   -          Wound consult.
   -          Dry gauze to open areas for now.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Send c.diff; start metronidazole empirically if starts to
   have diarrhea.
   -          Heme primary team aware of admission to MICU.
   -          Continue hydroxyurea.
   .
   # Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea once mental status improves and taking
   PO.
   -          NGT if prolonged aspiration issues and needing to get PO
   meds in.
   -          Epogen weekly
   .
   # CHF, systolic dysfunction.  Currently appears slightly dry.  s/p 1.5
   L in ED.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   -          Gentle fluids while NPO.
   -          Not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] due to angioedema.
   .
   # CKD.  At approximate baseline creatinine (but up from 1.7
 most
   recent value).
   -          continue to trend, check urine lytes and UA.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Mild with bicarb 21.  AG 14.  Lactate 1.8.
   ?related to slight worsening of renal failure.
   -          continue to trend, 1/2NS or LR if needed as opposed to NS.
   .
   # Hepatitis. ?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR,
   AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).  Has
   ascites on imaging.  Thought to be due to infiltration of
   extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.
   -          fractionate bili - ?hemolytic process.  Send hemolysis labs
   as well, although Hct at  baseline.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), recurrent cellulitis, acute on chronic altered mental status, and pneumonia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with the following medical conditions:

1. Pneumonia: The patient presents with fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrate on chest X-ray. The source of pneumonia is likely to be community-acquired or healthcare-associated, and atypical pathogens such as Legionella should also be considered. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and further tests such as sputum culture and blood cultures are planned.

2. Fever: The patient's fever is likely due to pneumonia, but other infectious sources including urinary tract infection and Clostridium difficile infection should also be considered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures will be followed up to guide treatment.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is a chronic issue and may be exacerbated by the current infection. Other potential causes include uremia from worsening renal failure and hepatic encephalopathy due to chronic liver disease. Antipsychotics may be used for agitation, and reorientation is important.

4. Cellulitis: The patient has bilateral lower extremities with erythema, edema, warmth, and scabs. This is consistent with cellulitis, especially considering the patient's history of PVD"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is agitation and pneumonia. The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD (peripheral vascular disease), and recurrent cellulitis. The patient was admitted with acute on chronic altered mental status and pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include pneumonia, fever, leukocytosis, altered mental status, cellulitis, leukocytosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

For the pneumonia, the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover atypical organisms including Legionella, virals, and CAP/HCAP. A sputum culture is pending, and blood cultures have been sent for follow-up.

Regarding the altered mental status, the patient is on antipsychotics as needed, preferably IV if not tolerating PO or unable to safely swallow. Restraints are used prn to prevent pulling tubes. Treatment of infection and a trial of lactulose have been considered due to possible hepatic encephalopathy.

The cellulitis is being treated with the same"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD,
   recurrent cellulitis; admit with acute on chronic altered mental status
   and pneumonia.
   .
   # Pneumonia.  Fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.  O2 sats
   excellent and hemodynamically stable.  CAP vs. HCAP (lives in nursing
   home and frequent hospital exposure) vs. aspiration.  Localized likely
   to RLL.  Also consider atypicals including legionella, virals.
   - vanc/zosyn/levoflox for atypicals
   - Sputum culture if can produce
   - f/u blood cultures
   - speech and swallow for ?aspiration
   - consider tap of R effusion if enlarges (right now small on lung cuts
   of CT abdomen).
   .
   # Fever.  Pneumonia as above; also consider other infectious sources
   (urine, c.diff/stool, flu, other abdominal).
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics to start; f/u culture data
   including urine, blood, c.diff, virals.
   -          f/u final read of abdominal CT
   .
   # Altered mental status.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Agitation prior to admission.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease (though unclear if truly cirrhotic physiology).
   -          antipsychotics standing and as needed, place NGT. Prefer to
   avoid benzos, but per family haldol makes him hallucinate and only
   ativan works.  Restraints prn to prevent pulling tubes.
   -          trial of lactulose given liver disease.
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          NGT.  Hold all PO intake for now; speech and swallow if
   mental status not improving or aspiration an ongoing concern.
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   -          Fall precautions.
   # Tachypnea.  RR consistently in low 30s.  O2 sats have been
   excellent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be tachypneic due metabolic acidosis.
   - ABG prn, recheck lytes this afternoon.
   .
   # Cellulitis.  Bilat LEs with erythema, edema, warmth.  Scabs over legs
   as above.  Has bad PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound
   consult.  Last received clinda during last admit in late [**Month (only) 1148**].
   -          antibiotic course as above.
   -          Wound consult.
   -          Dry gauze to open areas for now.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Send c.diff; start metronidazole empirically if starts to
   have diarrhea.
   -          Heme primary team aware of admission to MICU.
   -          Continue hydroxyurea.
   .
   # Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea via NGT
   -          Epogen weekly
   .
   # CHF, systolic dysfunction.  s/p 1.5 L in ED, ~1L here.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   -          Not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] due to angioedema.
   .
   # CKD.  At approximate baseline creatinine last night, but with some
   worsening today.  Got NS in ED.  Urine lytes looked dry.
   -                serum and urine lytes again this afternoon.
          -          Give another liter today and recheck labs.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Mild yesterday but worsening today.  AG now 16.
   Lactate slightly up.  ?related to slight worsening of renal failure.
   -          bolus, recheck chems this afternoon
   .
   # Hepatitis. ?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR,
   AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).  Has
   ascites on imaging.  Thought to be due to infiltration of
   extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.
   -                trial of lactulose as above
   -                should have outpatient liver referral.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, peripheral vascular disease, recurrent cellulitis, and chronic liver disease. He was admitted with acute on chronic altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient has been febrile, leukocytosis, and has an infiltrate on chest X-ray. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further cultures will be obtained. His altered mental status may be exacerbated by the current infection, and other differentials include uremia from worsening renal failure or hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is tachypneic with low oxygen saturation, but his metabolic acidosis has improved. He also has cellulitis on both lower extremities and leukocytosis, which may be due to his underlying myelofibrosis. The patient's myelofibrosis/anemia, CHF/systolic dysfunction, CKD, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further cultures will be obtained.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has erythema, edema, warmth, and scabs over his lower extremities, indicating cellulitis. Antibiotic treatment has been initiated, and wound consult has been requested.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with myelofibrosis, extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recurrent cellulitis. He was admitted with acute on chronic altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient has a history of myelofibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis, which can lead to leukocytosis during times of stress and infection due to disordered cell production. He also has a history of chronic liver disease and is suspected to have cirrhotic physiology. The patient's condition includes fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR, altered mental status, tachypnea, cellulitis, leukocytosis, myelofibrosis/anemia, CHF, systolic dysfunction, CKD, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms such as fever, leukocytosis, and an infiltrate on CXR, indicating a possible pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has erythema, edema, and warmth in the bilateral lower extremities, suggesting cellulitis. If left untreated, it can progress and lead to more severe skin infections or sepsis.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's ongoing issue is an altered mental status, which may be"

","The patient is a  [age] -year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), a heart rate of 61 bpm, a blood pressure of 127/45 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic anticoagulation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient has abnormal liver function tests and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient's arterial blood gas reveals respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally in the chest, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities. The patient is unable to follow simple commands and responds randomly.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, progression of pneumonia, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential thromboembolic events. The patient's altered mental status and absent peripheral pulses also raise concerns for possible underlying conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or peripheral artery disease.

It is important to monitor"

   - vanc/zosyn/levoflox for atypicals
   - Sputum culture if can produce
   - f/u blood cultures
   - speech and swallow for ?aspiration
   - consider tap of R effusion if enlarges (right now small on lung cuts
   of CT abdomen).
   .
   # Fever.  Pneumonia as above; also consider other infectious sources
   (urine, c.diff/stool, flu, other abdominal).
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics to start; f/u culture data
   including urine, blood, c.diff, virals.
   -          f/u final read of abdominal CT
   .
   # Altered mental status.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Agitation prior to admission.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease (though unclear if truly cirrhotic physiology).
   -          antipsychotics standing and as needed, place NGT. Prefer to
   avoid benzos, but per family haldol makes him hallucinate and only
   ativan works.  Restraints prn to prevent pulling tubes.
   -          trial of lactulose given liver disease.
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          NGT.  Hold all PO intake for now; speech and swallow if
   mental status not improving or aspiration an ongoing concern.
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   -          Fall precautions.
   # Tachypnea.  RR consistently in high 20s.  O2 sats have been
   excellent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be tachypneic due metabolic acidosis  Metabolic
   acidosis worsened with lactulose.
   - monitor respiratory status, rate
   .
   # Cellulitis.  Bilat LEs with erythema, edema, warmth.  Scabs over legs
   as above.  Has bad PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound
   consult.  Last received clinda during last admit in late [**Month (only) 1148**].
   -          antibiotic course as above.
   -          Wound consult.
   -          Dry gauze to open areas for now.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Send c.diff; start metronidazole empirically if starts to
   have diarrhea.
   -          Heme primary team aware of admission to MICU.
   -          Continue hydroxyurea.
   .
   # Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea via NGT
   -          Epogen weekly
   .
   # CHF, systolic dysfunction.  s/p 1.5 L in ED, ~1L here.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   -          Not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] due to angioedema.
   .
   # CKD.  At approximate baseline creatinine last night, but with some
   worsening today.  Got NS in ED.  Urine lytes looked dry.
   -                serum and urine lytes again this afternoon.
          -          Give another liter today and recheck labs.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Mild yesterday but worsening today.  Lactate
   slightly elevate in AM yesterday, but normalized in PM.  ?related to
   slight worsening of renal failure.  Did not improve with fluid boluses,
   however, lactulose may have contributed to worsening metabolic
   acidosis.
   -          bolus, recheck chems this afternoon
   .
   # Hepatitis. ?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR,
   AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).  Has
   ascites on imaging.  Thought to be due to infiltration of
   extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.  Mild
   improvement of mental status with lactulose.
   -                trial of lactulose as above
   -                should have outpatient liver referral.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD, recurrent cellulitis, acute on chronic altered mental status, and pneumonia. The patient's chief complaint is pneumonia, and he has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a fever and leukocytosis. The patient has localized pneumonia in the right lower lobe, and there are concerns about aspiration. Other potential sources of infection include the urinary tract, Clostridium difficile/stool, flu, and other abdominal infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures will be followed up. The patient's altered mental status may be due to an ongoing issue for several months, possibly exacerbated by the current infection. Uremia from worsening renal failure and hepatic encephalopathy are also considered. The patient's tachypnea is likely related to metabolic acidosis, which worsened with lactulose. The patient has cellulitis with bilateral lower extremities showing erythema, edema, and warmth. The patient's leukocytosis may be due to treating pneumonia and cellulitis, as well as considering C. difficile. The patient's myelofibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis can lead to high WBC counts during times of stress and infection. The patient has chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure with systolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD,
   recurrent cellulitis; admit with acute on chronic altered mental status
   and pneumonia.
   .
   # Pneumonia.  Fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.  O2 sats
   excellent and hemodynamically stable.  CAP vs. HCAP (lives in nursing
   home and frequent hospital exposure) vs. aspiration.  Localized likely
   to RLL.  Also consider atypicals including legionella, virals.
   - vanc/zosyn/levoflox for atypicals
   - Sputum culture pending
   - f/u blood cultures
   - speech and swallow for ?aspiration
   - consider tap of R effusion if enlarges (right now small on lung cuts
   of CT abdomen).
   .
   # Fever.  Pneumonia as above; also consider other infectious sources
   (urine, c.diff/stool, flu, other abdominal).
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics to start; f/u culture data
   including urine, blood, c.diff, virals.
   -          f/u final read of abdominal CT
   .
   # Altered mental status.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Agitation prior to admission.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease (though unclear if truly cirrhotic physiology).
   -          antipsychotics standing and as needed, place NGT. Per family
   haldol makes him hallucinate and only ativan works.  Restraints prn to
   prevent pulling tubes.
   -          trial of lactulose given liver disease.
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          NGT.  Hold all PO intake for now; speech and swallow if
   mental status not improving or aspiration an ongoing concern.
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   -          Fall precautions.
   # Tachypnea.  RR consistently in high 20s.  O2 sats have been excellent
   on 2LNC.  [**Month (only) 51**] be tachypneic due metabolic acidosis  Metabolic acidosis
   worsened with lactulose.
   - monitor respiratory status, rate
   .
   # Cellulitis.  Bilat LEs with erythema, edema, warmth.  Scabs over legs
   as above.  Has bad PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound
   consult.  Last received clinda during last admit in late [**Month (only) 1148**].
   -          antibiotic course as above.
   -          Wound consult.
   -          Dry gauze to open areas for now.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Send c.diff; start metronidazole empirically if starts to
   have diarrhea.
   -          Heme primary team aware of admission to MICU; discuss with
   them if hydrea dose needs to be increased due to rising WBC
   -          Continue hydroxyurea.
   .
   # Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea via NGT
   -          Epogen weekly
   .
   # CHF, systolic dysfunction.  s/p 1.5 L in ED, ~1L here.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   -          Not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] due to angioedema.
   .
   # CKD. Baseline Cr of 2.0, now up to 2.4.  Likely pre-renal given urine
   lytes, concentrated urine.  Will hold lactulose so that dehydration is
   not worsening.  Minimal response yesterday to 2L NS.
   -                serum and urine lytes again this afternoon.
          -          Give [**1-5**]  liters today and recheck labs.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Worsening metabolic acidosis, likely secondary
   to worsening renal failure and to diarrhea from lactulose.  Lactate
   wnl.
   -          bolus, recheck chems this afternoon
   - hold lactulose
   - replete fluid
   .
   # Hepatitis. ?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR,
   AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).  Has
   ascites on imaging.  Thought to be due to infiltration of
   extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.  Mild
   improvement of mental status with lactulose.
   -                Hold lactulose due to dehyration
   -                should have outpatient liver referral.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recurrent cellulitis. He was admitted with acute on chronic altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, fever, leukocytosis, tachypnea, cellulitis, leukocytosis, altered mental status, and possible metabolic acidosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, aspiration pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, worsening of myelofibrosis, exacerbation of peripheral vascular disease, and complications related to the use of long-term antibiotics.

Plan:
1. Continue treatment for pneumonia and cellulitis with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Monitor respiratory status and consider speech and swallow evaluation if mental status does not improve or there is a concern for aspiration.
3. Consider a tap of right effusion if it enlarges.
4. Review and manage other infectious sources such as urine, c.diff/stool, flu, and other abdominal infections.
5. Maintain fluid balance and monitor renal function closely.
6. Provide frequent reorientation and consider fall precautions.
7. Continue hydroxyurea and epogen as per heme primary team discussion.
8. Hold beta-blockers and diuretics until the patient is taking oral intake well.
9. Hold lactulose due to dehydration and consider restarting"

   CXR [**10-26**]: worsening RLL and RML process.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD,
   recurrent cellulitis; admit with acute on chronic altered mental status
   and pneumonia possibly [**1-4**] aspiration with improvement over the last
   24hrs but not to baseline mental status
   > Pneumonia.  Fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.   CAP vs. HCAP
   (lives in nursing home and frequent hospital exposure) vs. aspiration.
   Localized likely to RLL on imaging and worse on CXR [**10-26**]
   - Sputum culture if can produce (last specimen poor quality on [**10-26**])
   - Will stop levaquin as well, Cont Vanco and Pip-tazo for 10 day course
   - f/u blood cultures
   - speech and swallow for ?aspiration
   - consider tap of R effusion if enlarges (right now small on lung cuts
   of CT abdomen), if he has another fever.
   > Fever.  Pneumonia as above; also consider other infectious sources
   (urine, c.diff/stool, flu, other abdominal), also probably had a
   bilateral lower ext cellulitis which has improved with abx coverage
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics to start; f/u culture data
   including urine, blood, c.diff, virals.
   > Altered mental status.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Agitation prior to admission.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease (though unclear if truly cirrhotic physiology).
   -          antipsychotics standing and as needed, place NGT. Prefer to
   avoid benzos, but per family haldol makes him hallucinate and only
   ativan works.  Restraints prn to prevent pulling tubes.
   -          cont lactulose to reverse whatever con
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          NGT.  Hold all PO intake for now;
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   -          Fall precautions.
   >Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Send c.diff; start metronidazole empirically if starts to
   have diarrhea.
   -          Continue hydroxyurea.
   > Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea via NGT
   -          Epogen weekly
   > Failed swallow eval: can trial a repeat attempt at NG for now and
   will d/w family the placement of a PEG tube.
   - NG
   - PEG after discussion with family.
   >CHF, systolic dysfunction.  s/p 1.5 L in ED, ~1L here.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   > CKD.  At approximate baseline creatinine last night, but with some
   worsening today.  Got NS in ED.  Urine lytes looked dry now euvolemic
   with perhaps new baseline .
   -                serum and urine lytes again this afternoon.
   > Renal failure: baseline Cr is somewhere b/w 1.7 and 2.3 now with
   evidence of stabilization of Cr at 2.3. with a transient lowering of
   HCO3. Would favor IV bolus (given NPO status ) for goal of even. Check
   urine eos and renal U/S
   - will check Una/Ucl and fluid bolus with LR
   >Hepatitis. ?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR,
   AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).  Has
   ascites on imaging.  Thought to be due to infiltration of
   extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.
   -                should have outpatient liver referral.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD, and recurrent cellulitis. He was admitted with acute on chronic altered mental status and pneumonia, possibly aspiration. The patient has shown improvement over the last 24 hours but not to baseline mental status. His current condition includes pneumonia, fever, leukocytosis, and localized infection in the right lower lobe. He also has cellulitis in both lower extremities, which has improved with antibiotic coverage. The patient's other medical conditions include chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction, and possible cirrhotic physiology with chronic liver disease. He has been experiencing altered mental status for several months, which may be exacerbated by the current infection or other factors such as uremia or hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy, obtain sputum culture if possible, and follow up with blood cultures.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has shown improvement in his lower extremity cellulitis with antibiotic coverage. However, there is still a risk of complications such as abscess formation or systemic spread of infection. Monitoring for any worsening signs or symptoms is crucial.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's ongoing issue of altered mental status requires further evaluation and management. Potential causes include infection, uremia, or hepatic encephalopathy. Antipsychotic medication may be required for agitation, and NG tube placement may be considered to prevent aspiration.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. Close monitoring of kidney function and urine output is necessary. Fluid and electrolyte management should be tailored accordingly.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's history of CHF and systolic dysfunction should be considered when managing his fluid status and medication regimen.
6. Cirrhotic Physiology: The patient's liver function tests suggest chronic liver disease. Further evaluation by a liver specialist is recommended to assess the extent of liver involvement and guide management.
7. Myelofibrosis/Anemia: The patient's underlying myelofibrosis and anemia require ongoing management, including hydroxyurea therapy and erythropoietin supplementation.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition necessitates careful monitoring and management of multiple organ systems. Close collaboration among the ICU team, including physicians, nurses, and specialists, is crucial to address the potential medical complications and optimize the patient's outcome."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recurrent cellulitis. He was admitted with acute on chronic altered mental status and pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. The patient has shown improvement over the last 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has fever, leukocytosis, and an infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation levels and consider obtaining sputum culture if possible.
2. Aspiration: Given the patient's altered mental status and previous episodes of agitation, there is a risk of aspiration. A speech and swallow evaluation is recommended to assess the risk of aspiration and determine the need for a nasogastric tube.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has a history of recurrent cellulitis and currently shows signs of improvement. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and cultures should be monitored for any changes.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is ongoing and may be exacerbated by the current infection. Differential diagnoses include uremia from worsening renal failure and hepatic encephalopathy. Antipsychotics may be used as needed, and reorientation should be frequent.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to treating for"

   CXR [**10-26**]: worsening RLL and RML process.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD,
   recurrent cellulitis; admit with acute on chronic altered mental status
   and pneumonia possibly [**1-4**] aspiration with improvement over the last
   24hrs but not to baseline mental status
   > Pneumonia.  Fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.   CAP vs. HCAP
   (lives in nursing home and frequent hospital exposure) vs. aspiration.
   Localized likely to RLL on imaging and worse on CXR [**10-26**]
   - Sputum culture if can produce (last specimen poor quality on [**10-26**])
   - Will stop levaquin as well, Cont Vanco and Pip-tazo for 10 day course
   - f/u blood cultures
   - speech and swallow for ?aspiration
   - consider tap of R effusion if enlarges (right now small on lung cuts
   of CT abdomen), if he has another fever.
   > Fever.  Pneumonia as above; also consider other infectious sources
   (urine, c.diff/stool, flu, other abdominal), also probably had a
   bilateral lower ext cellulitis which has improved with abx coverage
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics to start; f/u culture data
   including urine, blood, c.diff, virals.
   > Encephalopathy.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Agitation prior to admission.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease (though unclear if truly cirrhotic physiology).
   -          antipsychotics standing and as needed, place NGT. Prefer to
   avoid benzos, but per family haldol makes him hallucinate and only
   ativan works.  Restraints prn to prevent pulling tubes.
   -          cont lactulose to reverse whatever con
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          NGT.  Hold all PO intake for now;
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   -          Fall precautions.
   >Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Send c.diff; start metronidazole empirically if starts to
   have diarrhea.
   -          Continue hydroxyurea.
   > Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea via NGT
   -          Epogen weekly
   > Failed swallow eval: can trial a repeat attempt at NG for now and
   will d/w family the placement of a PEG tube.
   - NG
   - PEG after discussion with family.
   >CHF, systolic dysfunction.  s/p 1.5 L in ED, ~1L here.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   > CKD.  At approximate baseline creatinine last night, but with some
   worsening today.  Got NS in ED.  Urine lytes looked dry now euvolemic
   with perhaps new baseline .
   -                serum and urine lytes again this afternoon.
   > Renal failure: baseline Cr is somewhere b/w 1.7 and 2.3 now with

   Assessment and Plan
   72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD,
   recurrent cellulitis; admit with acute on chronic altered mental status
   and pneumonia.
   > Pneumonia.  Fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.  O2 sats
   excellent and hemodynamically stable.  CAP vs. HCAP (lives in nursing
   home and frequent hospital exposure) vs. aspiration.  Localized likely
   to RLL.  Also consider atypicals including legionella, virals.
   - vanc/zosyn/levoflox for atypicals
   - Sputum culture if can produce
   - f/u blood cultures
   - speech and swallow for ?aspiration
   - consider tap of R effusion if enlarges (right now small on lung cuts
   of CT abdomen).
   > Fever.  Pneumonia as above; also consider other infectious sources
   (urine, c.diff/stool, flu, other abdominal).
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics to start; f/u culture data
   including urine, blood, c.diff, virals.
   -          f/u final read of abdominal CT
   .
   > Altered mental status.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Agitation prior to admission.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease (though unclear if truly cirrhotic physiology).
   -          antipsychotics standing and as needed, place NGT. Prefer to
   avoid benzos, but per family haldol makes him hallucinate and only
   ativan works.  Restraints prn to prevent pulling tubes.
   -          trial of lactulose given liver disease.
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          NGT.  Hold all PO intake for now; speech and swallow if
   mental status not improving or aspiration an ongoing concern.
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   -          Fall precautions.
   > Tachypnea.  RR consistently in low 30s.  O2 sats have been
   excellent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be tachypneic due metabolic acidosis.
   - ABG prn, recheck lytes this afternoon.
   > Cellulitis.  Bilat LEs with erythema, edema, warmth.  Scabs over legs
   as above.  Has bad PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound
   consult.  Last received clinda during last admit in late [**Month (only) 1148**].
   -          antibiotic course as above.
   -          Wound consult.
   -          Dry gauze to open areas for now.
   >Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Send c.diff; start metronidazole empirically if starts to
   have diarrhea.
   -          Heme primary team aware of admission to MICU.
   -          Continue hydroxyurea.
   > Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea via NGT
   -          Epogen weekly
   .
   >CHF, systolic dysfunction.  s/p 1.5 L in ED, ~1L here.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   -          Not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] due to angioedema.
   .
   > CKD.  At approximate baseline creatinine last night, but with some
   worsening today.  Got NS in ED.  Urine lytes looked dry.
   -                serum and urine lytes again this afternoon.
          -          Give another liter today and recheck labs.
   .
   > Metabolic acidosis.  Mild yesterday but worsening today.  AG now 16.
   Lactate slightly up.  ?related to slight worsening of renal failure.
   -          bolus, recheck chems this afternoon
   >Hepatitis. ?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR,
   AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).  Has
   ascites on imaging.  Thought to be due to infiltration of
   extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.
   -                trial of lactulose as above
   -                should have outpatient liver referral.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD, recurrent cellulitis, and chronic liver disease. He was admitted with acute on chronic altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient presents with fever, leukocytosis, and an infiltrate on chest X-ray. This indicates a potential respiratory infection that requires prompt treatment.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has ongoing issues with mental status changes, which may be exacerbated by the current infection. Other differentials include uremia from worsening renal failure and hepatic encephalopathy due to chronic liver disease.
3. Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory rate is consistently in the low 30s, but oxygen saturation levels are excellent. Metabolic acidosis may be contributing to the tachypnea.
4. Cellulitis: The patient has bilateral lower extremities with erythema, edema, warmth, and scabs. He has a history of poor peripheral vascular disease, seen by the vascular team, and previous wound consults. Antibiotic treatment is necessary.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to infection or myelofibrosis. Treating for pneumonia and cellulitis is appropriate.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD,
   recurrent cellulitis; admit with acute on chronic altered mental status
   and pneumonia.
   .
   # Pneumonia.  Fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.  O2 sats
   excellent and hemodynamically stable.  CAP vs. HCAP (lives in nursing
   home and frequent hospital exposure) vs. aspiration.  Localized likely
   to RLL.
   - vanc/zosyn; will d/c levofloxacin
   - Sputum culture contaminated, repeat if able to produce a specimen.
   - speech and swallow  - not safe for PO.  Will need to address possible
   PEG.
   - consider tap of R effusion if enlarges (right now small on lung cuts
   of CT abdomen) or patient febrile.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Agitation prior to admission.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease.
   -          antipsychotics standing and as needed, place NGT. Per family
   haldol makes him hallucinate and only ativan works.  Restraints prn to
   prevent pulling tubes.
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          NGT.  Possible PEG as above..
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   .
   # Tachypnea.  RR consistently in high 20s.  O2 sats have been excellent
   on 2LNC.  [**Month (only) 51**] be tachypneic due metabolic acidosis  Metabolic acidosis
   worsened with lactulose, so discontinued.  Will continue to monitor
   lytes.
   .
   # Cellulitis.  Bilat LEs with erythema, edema, warmth.  Scabs over legs
   as above.  Has bad PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound
   consult.  Last received clinda during last admit in late [**Month (only) 1148**].
   Improving with start of IV antibiotics.
   -          antibiotic course as above.
   -          Wound consult.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Heme primary team aware of admission to MICU; will discuss
   with them if hydrea dose needs to be increased due to rising WBC
   -          Continue hydroxyurea at current dosing for now.
   .
   # Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea via NGT
   -          Epogen weekly
   .
   # CHF, systolic dysfunction.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   -          Not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] due to angioedema.
   .
   # ARF on CKD. Baseline Cr of 2.0, now up to 2.3-2.5.  Urine lytes
   suggest prerenal; creatinine has not improved with fluid boluses though
   UOP reasonably good yesterday.
    -               1 L bolus and recheck urine lytes (giving LR).  Also
   check urine eos.
   -                monitor lytes
   -                will check renal ultrasound to rule out obstruction.
   -                will alert patient
s primary nephrologist to
   admission.
   -                check vanco trough.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Worsening metabolic acidosis, likely secondary
   to worsening renal failure and to diarrhea from lactulose.  Lactate
   wnl.
   -          bolus, recheck chems this afternoon
   -          hold lactulose
   -          replete fluid
   .
   # Hepatitis. ?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR,
   AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).  Has
   ascites on imaging.  Thought to be due to infiltration of
   extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.  Mild
   improvement of mental status with lactulose.
   -                Hold lactulose due to dehyration
   -                should have outpatient liver referral.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of myelofibrosis, extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD, recurrent cellulitis, acute on chronic altered mental status, and pneumonia. 

The patient has been admitted with symptoms of pneumonia, which includes fever, leukocytosis, and an infiltrate on chest X-ray. The pneumonia is likely community-acquired or healthcare-associated due to the patient's frequent hospital exposure. Aspiration pneumonia is also a possible differential diagnosis. The patient is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn for the treatment of pneumonia. 

The patient also presents with altered mental status, which is an ongoing issue for several months. This can be exacerbated by the current infection, uremia from worsening renal failure, or hepatic encephalopathy given the chronic liver disease. 

Other findings include tachypnea with a respiratory rate consistently in the high 20s, excellent oxygen saturation on 2LNC, and metabolic acidosis that has worsened with lactulose. Lactic acid levels are within normal limits. 

The patient has a history of cellulitis with bilateral lower extremities showing erythema, edema, and warmth. Improving with the start of IV antibiotics. 

Leukocytosis is present, likely due to treating for pneumonia and cellulitis, as well as considering C. diff given the recent use of clindamycin."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD,
   recurrent cellulitis; admit with acute on chronic altered mental status
   and pneumonia.
   .
   # Pneumonia.  Fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.  O2 sats
   excellent and hemodynamically stable.  CAP vs. HCAP (lives in nursing
   home and frequent hospital exposure) vs. aspiration.  Localized likely
   to RLL.  Also consider atypicals including legionella, virals.
   - vanc/zosyn/levoflox for atypicals
   - Sputum culture pending
   - f/u blood cultures
   - speech and swallow for ?aspiration
   - consider tap of R effusion if enlarges (right now small on lung cuts
   of CT abdomen).
   .
   # Fever.  Pneumonia as above; also consider other infectious sources
   (urine, c.diff/stool, flu, other abdominal).
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics to start; f/u culture data
   including urine, blood, c.diff, virals.
   -          f/u final read of abdominal CT
   .
   # Altered mental status.  An ongoing issue for several months.  Sees
   outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.  Agitation prior to admission.
   Likely exacerbated by current infection. Other differential includes
   uremia from worsening renal failure; hepatic encephalopathy given
   chronic liver disease (though unclear if truly cirrhotic physiology).
   -          antipsychotics standing and as needed, place NGT. Per family
   haldol makes him hallucinate and only ativan works.  Restraints prn to
   prevent pulling tubes.
   -          trial of lactulose given liver disease.
   -          Treatment of infection.
   -          NGT.  Hold all PO intake for now; speech and swallow if
   mental status not improving or aspiration an ongoing concern.
   -          Frequent reorientation.
   -          Fall precautions.
   .
   # Tachypnea.  RR consistently in high 20s.  O2 sats have been excellent
   on 2LNC.  [**Month (only) 51**] be tachypneic due metabolic acidosis  Metabolic acidosis
   worsened with lactulose.
   - monitor respiratory status, rate
   .
   # Cellulitis.  Bilat LEs with erythema, edema, warmth.  Scabs over legs
   as above.  Has bad PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound
   consult.  Last received clinda during last admit in late [**Month (only) 1148**].
   -          antibiotic course as above.
   -          Wound consult.
   -          Dry gauze to open areas for now.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Treating for pneumonia and cellultiis as above.  Also
   consider C.diff given history of this and recent clindamycin use,
   though no diarrhea.  Patient also with history of myelofibrois and
   extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Per hematologist, often tends to spike
   high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell
   production.
   -          antibiotics as above.
   -          Send c.diff; start metronidazole empirically if starts to
   have diarrhea.
   -          Heme primary team aware of admission to MICU; discuss with
   them if hydrea dose needs to be increased due to rising WBC
   -          Continue hydroxyurea.
   .
   # Myelofibrosis/anemia.  Discussed with heme.
   -          continue hydroxyurea via NGT
   -          Epogen weekly
   .
   # CHF, systolic dysfunction.  s/p 1.5 L in ED, ~1L here.
   -          hold BB and diuretic right now while acutely infected and
   not taking PO well.
   -          Not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] due to angioedema.
   .
   # CKD. Baseline Cr of 2.0, now up to 2.4.  Likely pre-renal given urine
   lytes, concentrated urine.  Will hold lactulose so that dehydration is
   not worsening.  Minimal response yesterday to 2L NS.
   -                serum and urine lytes again this afternoon.
          -          Give [**1-5**]  liters today and recheck labs.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Worsening metabolic acidosis, likely secondary
   to worsening renal failure and to diarrhea from lactulose.  Lactate
   wnl.
   -          bolus, recheck chems this afternoon
   - hold lactulose
   - replete fluid
   .
   # Hepatitis. ?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR,
   AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).  Has
   ascites on imaging.  Thought to be due to infiltration of
   extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.  Mild
   improvement of mental status with lactulose.
   -                Hold lactulose due to dehyration
   -                should have outpatient liver referral.
