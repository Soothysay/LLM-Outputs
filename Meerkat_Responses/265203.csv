   Assessment and Plan
   55-F w/ hepatic sarcoidosis / regenerative hyperplasia, s/p TIPS
   [**12/2109**] placed [**3-15**] variceal bleeding / portal hypertensive gastropathy,
   s/p TIPS re-do with angioplasty / portal vein embolectomy, who is
   admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Encephalopathy - Pt brought in to ED by husband for asterixis and
   concern for impending encephalopathy, and pt became increasingly
   combative and then unresponsive in ED, c/w past episodes of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Ammonia level 280 on admission. Also in acute renal
   failure w/ elevated BUN and Cr from baseline. Most likely hepatic
   encephalopathy, although uremia from ARF may also be contributing.
   Received lactulose and kayexelate in ED. Guaiac negative in ED, w/ UA /
   CXR pending.
   - NGT to suction
   - monitor for signs of GI bleeding as potential source of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   - f/u blood and urine Cx data
   - will continue lactulose pr as pt cannot take po, titrate to 3 BMs /
   day
   - IVF / albumin as below for ARF
   - holding all sedating meds (gabapentin, amitryptyline, zolpidem)
   - Per liver, giving flagyl empirically for bacterial translocation
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt w/ ARF as evidenced by elevated BUN and Cr
   to 46 and 2.2 on admission, up from baseline BUN [**6-21**] and baseline Cr
   0.8-1.0.
   - IVF for pre-renal azotemia
   - consider albumin for ARF given concern for hepato-renal syndrome
   - holding diuretics (Lasix, spironolactone)
   - holding diltiazem for now as unclear if pt takes this at home
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Pt w/ elevated K to 5.5 on admission, received
   Kayexelate in ED but likely not absorbed as pt had emesis on arrival to
   ICU. ECG without hyperkalemic changes.
   - repeat K w/ next lab check
   - cont to follow
   .
   #. Hepatic sarcoidosis w/ regenerative hyperplasia - Pt is s/p TIPS x2.
   Currently on Ursodiol at home. LFTs WNL on arrival, Ammonia elevated as
   above.
   - cont home dose of Ursodiol, Prednisone
   - cont home vitamins (MVI / thiamine / folate, iron)
   - cont lactulose as above, titrate to 3 BMs/day
   - cont home PPI and sucralfate
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home dose of levothyroxine
   #. Thrombocytopenia- recheck platelet count

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, regenerative hyperplasia, and previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. She presented to the emergency department with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, including asterixis and combativeness. She also has acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient is currently intubated due to her inability to protect her airway. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, which is low. Fluid resuscitation has been initiated with lactated Ringer's solution. Lactulose enemas have been administered, but they have not been fully effective. Propranolol has been added to prevent variceal bleeding, and Flagyl has been given empirically for bacterial translocation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated ammonia levels, indicative of hepatic encephalopathy. Her potassium level is also elevated at 5.5, but no hyperkalemic changes are noted on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Her liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, but she has elevated bilirubin levels. Other lab results show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. The patient's platelet count is low at 69,000/mL.

   55-F w/ hepatic sarcoidosis / regenerative hyperplasia, s/p TIPS
   [**12/2109**] placed [**3-15**] variceal bleeding / portal hypertensive gastropathy,
   s/p TIPS re-do with angioplasty / portal vein embolectomy, who is
   admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Encephalopathy - Pt brought in to ED by husband for asterixis and
   concern for impending encephalopathy, and pt became increasingly
   combative and then unresponsive in ED, c/w past episodes of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Ammonia level 280 on admission. Also in acute renal
   failure w/ elevated BUN and Cr from baseline. Most likely hepatic
   encephalopathy, although uremia from ARF may also be contributing.
   Received lactulose and kayexelate in ED. Guaiac negative in ED, w/ UA /
   CXR pending.
   - NGT to suction
   - monitor for signs of GI bleeding as potential source of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   - f/u blood and urine Cx data
   - will continue lactulose pr as pt cannot take po, titrate to 3 BMs /
   day
   - IVF / albumin as below for ARF
   - holding all sedating meds (gabapentin, amitryptyline, zolpidem)
   - Per liver, giving flagyl empirically for bacterial translocation.  Pt
   is allergic to cipro
   - Need to follow up with liver regarding their recs, specifically
   capsule endocscopy in setting of SBO
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt w/ ARF as evidenced by elevated BUN and Cr
   to 46 and 2.2 on admission, up from baseline BUN [**6-21**] and baseline Cr
   0.8-1.0.
   - IVF for pre-renal azotemia.  Using LR given hyperchloremia.  However,
   most important is just to give fluid.
   - consider albumin for ARF given concern for hepato-renal syndrome.
   Will continue with crystalloid at this time
   - holding diuretics (Lasix, spironolactone)
   - holding diltiazem for now as unclear if pt takes this at home
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Pt w/ elevated K to 5.5 on admission, received
   Kayexelate in ED but likely not absorbed as pt had emesis on arrival to
   ICU. ECG without hyperkalemic changes.
   - K+ wnl
   - cont to follow
   .
   #. Hepatic sarcoidosis w/ regenerative hyperplasia - Pt is s/p TIPS x2.
   Currently on Ursodiol at home. LFTs WNL on arrival, Ammonia elevated as
   above.
   - cont home dose of Ursodiol, Prednisone
   - cont home vitamins (MVI / thiamine / folate, iron)
   - cont lactulose as above, titrate to 3 BMs/day
   - cont home PPI.  No sucralfate given SBO
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home dose of levothyroxine
   #. Thrombocytopenia- currently at 60k, down from 119k at admission.
   Concerning for pre-formed HIT abs.  Will check.  If positive, most
   likely due to heparin coated central line and would req replacement
   with heparin free line.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequent transmigration of bacteria through the intestinal wall, leading to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's initial presentation included fever, tachycardia, hypoxia, and increased work of breathing. Initial blood cultures grew lactobacillus and group B strep, prompting the initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. However, the patient's condition deteriorated, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, the patient's blood cultures were positive for UCX, which was subsequently identified as Escherichia coli. This prompted the addition of piperacillin-tazobactam to the patient's antibiotic regimen.

Despite the aggressive management, the patient continued to experience hypoxia and worsening respiratory distress. A chest X-ray revealed increased opacity in the left lower lobe and a flattened right hemidiaphragm without evidence of pneumothorax. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicated respiratory alkalosis with low PCO2. As a result, the patient was switched to assist-control ventilation (AC) and propofol infusion was increased, resulting in improved comfort.

The patient has multiple allergies, including hives and hallucinations with doxycycline, rashes with quinine, muscle spasms with Compazine, tendonitis with Levaquin"

   Assessment and Plan
   55-F w/ hepatic sarcoidosis / regenerative hyperplasia, s/p TIPS
   [**12/2109**] placed [**3-15**] variceal bleeding / portal hypertensive gastropathy,
   s/p TIPS re-do with angioplasty / portal vein embolectomy, who is
   admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Encephalopathy - Pt brought in to ED by husband for asterixis and
   concern for impending encephalopathy, and pt became increasingly
   combative and then unresponsive in ED, c/w past episodes of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Ammonia level 280 on admission. Also in acute renal
   failure w/ elevated BUN and Cr from baseline. Most likely hepatic
   encephalopathy, although uremia from ARF may also be contributing.
   Received lactulose and kayexelate in ED. Guaiac negative in ED, w/ UA /
   CXR pending.
   - NGT to suction still draining a fair amount (>1500mL yesterday)
   - monitor for signs of GI bleeding as potential source of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   - f/u blood and urine Cx data
   - will continue lactulose pr as pt cannot take po, titrate to 3 BMs /
   day
   - IVF / albumin as below for ARF
   - holding all sedating meds (gabapentin, amitryptyline, zolpidem)
   - Per liver, giving flagyl empirically for bacterial translocation.  Pt
   is allergic to cipro
   - Need to follow up with liver regarding their recs, specifically
   capsule endocscopy in setting of SBO
   - Will do serial abdominal exams to ensure no rigidity of abdomen.
   .
   #. Fever: Has been pan-cultured. Concern for infection as cause for
   encephalopathy and also concern for SBP.  Has LLL infiltarate on CXR
   -Empiric vanc/zosyn for 7days for PNA in recently hospitalized patient
   on vent.
   -[**Month (only) 60**] need diagnostic tap today to r/o sbp
   -[**Month (only) 60**] need to broaden antibiotic coverage as only on pcn for +Ucx and
   flagyl for SBP ppx.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt w/ ARF as evidenced by elevated BUN and Cr
   to 46 and 2.2 on admission, up from baseline BUN [**6-21**] and baseline Cr
   0.8-1.0.
   - IVF for pre-renal azotemia.  Using LR given hyperchloremia.  UOP has
   been >30mL/hour.
   - consider albumin for ARF given concern for hepato-renal syndrome.
   Will continue with crystalloid at this time
   - holding diuretics (Lasix, spironolactone)
   - holding diltiazem for now as unclear if pt takes this at home
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Pt w/ elevated K to 5.5 on admission, received
   Kayexelate in ED but likely not absorbed as pt had emesis on arrival to
   ICU. ECG without hyperkalemic changes.
   - K+ wnl
   - cont to follow
   .
   #. Hepatic sarcoidosis w/ regenerative hyperplasia - Pt is s/p TIPS x2.
   Currently on Ursodiol at home. LFTs WNL on arrival, Ammonia elevated as
   above.
   - cont home dose of Ursodiol, Prednisone
   - cont home vitamins (MVI / thiamine / folate, iron)
   - cont lactulose as above, titrate to 3 BMs/day
   - cont home PPI.  No sucralfate given SBO
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home dose of levothyroxine
   #. Thrombocytopenia- currently at 60k, down from 119k at admission.
   Concerning for pre-formed HIT abs.  Will check.  If positive, most
   likely due to heparin coated central line and would req replacement
   with heparin free line.
   -Hit abs pending
   .
   #. Hypocalcemia: On sliding scale.

   Disposition: MICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with hepatic sarcoidosis and regenerative hyperplasia who has undergone two transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS). She is currently admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient presented with asterixis and concern for impending encephalopathy. She became increasingly combative and then unresponsive in the ED, consistent with past episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. Ammonia level was 280 on admission. Uremia from acute renal failure may also be contributing. She received lactulose and kayexelate in the ED. She has a NG tube draining a fair amount (>1500mL yesterday). Monitor for signs of GI bleeding as a potential source of hepatic encephalopathy. Follow-up blood and urine culture data.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has ARF with elevated BUN and creatinine from baseline. Most likely hepatic encephalopathy, although uremia from ARF may also be contributing. IVF and albumin as below for ARF. Holding all sedating medications.
3. Fever: The patient has been pancultured. Concern for infection as a cause for encephalopathy and also concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She has infiltrates on the left lower lobe (LLL) on chest X"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis and regenerative hyperplasia, who has undergone two transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and is currently unresponsive. The patient has a past episode of hepatic encephalopathy and her ammonia level on admission was 280. She is also experiencing acute renal failure with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient received lactulose and kayexelate in the emergency department. Her NG tube is still draining a significant amount of fluid, and she is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. Blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient is allergic to ciprofloxacin and cannot take oral medications. She requires follow-up with the liver regarding their recommendations, specifically capsule endoscopy due to small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient's abdominal exam will be monitored to ensure no signs of rigidity. 

Fever is present, and the patient has been pan-cultured. There is concern for infection as a cause of encephalopathy and also for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has infiltrates on chest X-ray, and empirical vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam are being administered for suspected pneumonia in a recently hospitalized patient on ventilation.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis and regenerative hyperplasia, who has undergone two transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) procedures. She is currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's recent events include being brought in by her husband for asterixis and concern for impending encephalopathy, becoming increasingly combative and then unresponsive in the emergency department (ED), and having elevated ammonia levels on admission.

The patient also presents with acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine from baseline. The patient's past medical history includes hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and a redo TIPS procedure with angioplasty and portal vein embolectomy.

The patient has several potential medical complications based on her current presentation and medical history. These include:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's presentation with asterixis, increased combativeness, and unresponsiveness suggests hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is characterized by neurologic dysfunction due to liver dysfunction and elevated ammonia levels. Lactulose has been initiated to reduce ammonia production and absorption in the gut.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. This"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman who has been admitted to the ICU with hepatic encephalopathy and respiratory failure. She has a history of allergies to certain medications, including ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, paroxetine, lithium, and metronidazole.

24-hour events include fever, blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine culture. The patient also experienced an episode of hypoxemia overnight. She continues to have renal failure but shows improvement. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/77 mmHg to 162/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she appears frail, has clear breath sounds with scant anterior wheezes, and her abdomen is soft and distended. Her extremities are edematous, and she has warm skin. Neurologically, she follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions. She has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, small bowel obstruction, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute renal failure, malnutrition, sarcoidosis, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on the ventilator. Her physical examination reveals frail appearance, warm skin, and distended abdomen. Neurologically, she follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, increased blood urea nitrogen of 105 mg/dL, decreased sodium of 123 mEq/L, and elevated creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL. The microbiology report indicates lactobacillus and group B streptococcus in the urine culture.

The plan for the patient includes starting presumptive treatment for VAP with vancomycin and Zosyn, initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and continuing renal support. The patient's allergies include hives from ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, paroxetine, lithium, and muscle spasms from prochlorperazine. She also has a history of tendinitis with levofloxacin and hair loss with paroxetine.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of hepatic encephalopathy, further respiratory failure, progression of small bowel obstruction, development of new infections due to immunosuppression from renal failure and malnutrition, and complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung injury. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   55-F w/ hepatic sarcoidosis / regenerative hyperplasia, s/p TIPS
   [**12/2109**] placed [**3-15**] variceal bleeding / portal hypertensive gastropathy,
   s/p TIPS re-do with angioplasty / portal vein embolectomy, who is
   admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy.
   #. Encephalopathy - Pt brought in to ED by husband for asterixis and
   concern for impending encephalopathy, and pt became increasingly
   combative and then unresponsive in ED, c/w past episodes of hepatic
   encephalopathy. Ammonia level 280 on admission. Also in acute renal
   failure w/ elevated BUN and Cr from baseline. Most likely hepatic
   encephalopathy, although uremia from ARF may also be contributing.
   Received lactulose and kayexelate in ED. Guaiac negative in ED, w/ UA /
   CXR pending.
   - NGT to suction still draining a fair amount
   - monitor for signs of GI bleeding as potential source of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   - f/u blood and urine Cx data
   - will continue lactulose pr as pt cannot take po, titrate to 3 BMs /
   day
   - IVF / albumin as below for ARF
   - holding all sedating meds (gabapentin, amitryptyline, zolpidem)
   - Per liver, giving flagyl empirically for bacterial translocation.  Pt
   is allergic to cipro
   - Need to follow up with liver regarding their recs, specifically
   capsule endocscopy in setting of SBO
   - Will do serial abdominal exams to ensure no rigidity of abdomen.
   #. Fever: Has been pan-cultured. Concern for infection as cause for
   encephalopathy and also concern for SBP.  Has LLL infiltarate on CXR
   -Empiric vanc/zosyn for 7days for PNA in recently hospitalized patient
   on vent.
   -[**Month (only) 60**] need diagnostic tap to r/o sbp
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt w/ ARF as evidenced by elevated BUN and Cr
   to 46 and 2.2 on admission, up from baseline BUN [**6-21**] and baseline Cr
   0.8-1.0.
   - IVF for pre-renal azotemia.  Using LR given hyperchloremia.  UOP has
   been >30mL/hour.
   - consider albumin for ARF given concern for hepato-renal syndrome.
   Will continue with crystalloid at this time
   - holding diuretics (Lasix, spironolactone)
   - holding diltiazem for now as unclear if pt takes this at home
   #. Hyperkalemia - Pt w/ elevated K to 5.5 on admission, received
   Kayexelate in ED but likely not absorbed as pt had emesis on arrival to
   ICU. ECG without hyperkalemic changes.
   - K+ wnl
   - cont to follow
   #. Hepatic sarcoidosis w/ regenerative hyperplasia - Pt is s/p TIPS x2.
   Currently on Ursodiol at home. LFTs WNL on arrival, Ammonia elevated as
   above.
   - cont home dose of Ursodiol, Prednisone
   - cont home vitamins (MVI / thiamine / folate, iron)
   - cont lactulose as above, titrate to 3 BMs/day
   - cont home PPI.  No sucralfate given SBO
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home dose of levothyroxine
   #. Thrombocytopenia- currently at 60k, down from 119k at admission.
   Concerning for pre-formed HIT abs.  Will check.  If positive, most
   likely due to heparin coated central line and would req replacement
   with heparin free line.
   -Hit abs pending
   #. Hypocalcemia: On sliding scale.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with hepatic sarcoidosis and regenerative hyperplasia who has been admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy. The patient presented to the emergency department with asterixis and concern for impending encephalopathy, and subsequently became increasingly combative and unresponsive. She has a history of variceal bleeding and portal hypertensive gastropathy, and has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure twice.

The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely due to hepatic dysfunction, as indicated by elevated ammonia levels. She has received lactulose and kayexelate in the emergency department, and will continue to be monitored for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. She is receiving intravenous fluids (LR) for pre-renal azotemia and may require albumin administration for hepato-renal syndrome.

3. Fever: The patient has been pan-cultured and is suspected to have an infection. Empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam has been initiated, and a diagnostic tap is needed to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with hepatic sarcoidosis and regenerative hyperplasia, who has undergone two transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) procedures. She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to encephalopathy and acute renal failure. The patient presented with asterixis and was unresponsive in the emergency department (ED), consistent with past episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. Her ammonia level was elevated at 280 on admission. She also has acute renal failure with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) from baseline.

The patient received lactulose and kayexelate in the ED. She has been improving, becoming more alert and able to follow commands. She has been weaned off sedatives and is expected to be extubated today. However, her nasogastric tube (NGT) is still draining a fair amount, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential source of hepatic encephalopathy.

She has a lower lobe lung infiltrate on chest X-ray and is at risk for infection, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has been pan-cultured and started empiric antibiotics for pneumonia and SBP. She has an allergy to ciprofloxacin.

The patient also has acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated BUN and Cr levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   55-F w/ hepatic sarcoidosis / regenerative hyperplasia, s/p TIPS
   [**12/2109**] placed [**3-15**] variceal bleeding / portal hypertensive gastropathy,
   s/p TIPS re-do with angioplasty / portal vein embolectomy, who is
   admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy.
   Pt brought in to ED by husband for asterixis and concern for impending
   encephalopathy, and pt became increasingly combative and then
   unresponsive in ED, c/w past episodes of hepatic encephalopathy.
   Ammonia level 280 on admission. Also in acute renal failure w/ elevated
   BUN and Cr from baseline. Most likely hepatic encephalopathy, although
   uremia from ARF may also be contributing. Received lactulose and
   kayexelate in ED. Guaiac negative in ED.
   #. Encephalopathy: Improving.
   - Asterixis noted to be resolved yesterday, [**10-13**]
   - Successfully extubated pt on [**10-13**]
   - NGT to suction still draining a fair amount
   - monitor for signs of GI bleeding as potential source of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   - will continue lactulose pr as pt cannot take po, titrate to 3 BMs /
   day
   - IVF / albumin as below for ARF
   - holding all sedating meds (gabapentin, amitryptyline, zolpidem)
   - Per liver, giving flagyl empirically for bacterial translocation.  Pt
   is allergic to cipro
   #. Fever: Last febrile [**10-12**] at 4am.  Has been pan-cultured. Concern for
   infection as cause for encephalopathy and also concern for SBP.  Has
   LLL infiltrate on CXR
   - Empiric vanc/zosyn for 7days for PNA in recently hospitalized patient
   on vent.
   - On flagyl empirically for SBP
   - Urine culture grew Group B strep, was on PCN G, but d/c'ed when
   started other abx
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt w/ ARF as evidenced by elevated BUN and Cr
   to 46 and 2.2 on admission, up from baseline BUN [**6-21**] and baseline Cr
   0.8-1.0.
   - IVF for pre-renal azotemia.  UOP has been >30mL/hour.
   - consider albumin for ARF given concern for hepato-renal syndrome.
   Will continue with crystalloid at this time.  However, low threshold to
   add albumin
   - holding diuretics (Lasix, spironolactone)
   - holding diltiazem for now as unclear if pt takes this at home
   #. Hyperkalemia - Pt w/ elevated K to 5.5 on admission, received
   Kayexelate in ED but likely not absorbed as pt had emesis on arrival to
   ICU. ECG without hyperkalemic changes.
   - K+ wnl
   - cont to follow
   #. Hepatic sarcoidosis w/ regenerative hyperplasia - Pt is s/p TIPS x2.
   Currently on Ursodiol at home. LFTs WNL on arrival, Ammonia elevated as
   above.
   - cont home dose of Ursodiol, on hydrocort (at home takes prednisone)
   - cont home vitamins (MVI / thiamine / folate, iron)
   - cont lactulose as above, titrate to 3 BMs/day
   -cont home PPI.  No sucralfate given SBO
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home dose of levothyroxine
   #. Thrombocytopenia- currently at 60k, down from 119k at admission.
   Concerning for pre-formed HIT abs.  Will check.  If positive, most
   likely due to heparin coated central line and would req replacement
   with heparin free line.
   -Called lab re antibodies and informed that this is a send out lab and
   will not have results for several days.
   #. Hypocalcemia: On sliding scale.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, regenerative hyperplasia, and previous TIPS procedure. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes improving encephalopathy, fever with LLL infiltrate on CXR, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, hypocalcemia, and hypoglycemia. She is on various medications including lactulose, albumin, ursodiol, hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, and TPN.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia levels and previous episodes of hepatic encephalopathy indicate an increased risk for recurrent episodes.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. If not properly managed, this can lead to further kidney damage or the need for dialysis.
3. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and LLL infiltrate on CXR raise concerns for a potential infection, such as pneumonia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Proper antibiotic therapy and source control measures are necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with hepatic sarcoidosis and regenerative hyperplasia admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. The patient has multiple medical complications including small bowel obstruction, anemia, hepatic sarcoidosis with encephalopathy, VAP, ARF, UTI, hypothyroidism, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and hypocalcemia. The patient is currently extubated and receiving TPN without lipids. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of these various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has a small bowel obstruction indicated by the presence of an NG tube in place, currently on suction, and stooling. It is recommended to continue NPO with the NG tube in place, clamp NG today and check residual after 3 hours (if low, pull NG). Follow BMs and abdominal exams.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute normocytic anemia, which is likely dilutional as well as due to phlebotomy. The Hct drop from 41 at presentation to 24 currently is worrisome for active bleeding. It is recommended to guiac all stools, recheck Hct this afternoon, and if continuing to drop, transfuse and consider CT/liver for EGD. Hemolysis labs should also be done.

   55-F w/ hepatic sarcoidosis / regenerative hyperplasia, s/p TIPS
   [**12/2109**] placed [**3-15**] variceal bleeding / portal hypertensive gastropathy,
   s/p TIPS re-do with angioplasty / portal vein embolectomy, who is
   admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy.
   Pt brought in to ED by husband for asterixis and concern for impending
   encephalopathy, and pt became increasingly combative and then
   unresponsive in ED, c/w past episodes of hepatic encephalopathy.
   Ammonia level 280 on admission. Also in acute renal failure w/ elevated
   BUN and Cr from baseline. Most likely hepatic encephalopathy, although
   uremia from ARF may also be contributing. Received lactulose and
   kayexelate in ED. Guaiac negative in ED.
   #. Encephalopathy: Improving.
   - Asterixis noted to be resolved yesterday, [**10-13**]
   - Successfully extubated pt on [**10-13**]
   - NGT to suction still draining a fair amount
   - monitor for signs of GI bleeding as potential source of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   - will continue lactulose pr as pt cannot take po, titrate to 3 BMs /
   day
   - IVF / albumin as below for ARF
   - holding all sedating meds (gabapentin, amitryptyline, zolpidem)
   - Per liver, giving flagyl empirically for bacterial translocation.  Pt
   is allergic to cipro
   #. Fever: Last febrile [**10-12**] at 4am.  Has been pan-cultured. Concern for
   infection as cause for encephalopathy and also concern for SBP.  Has
   LLL infiltrate on CXR
   - Empiric vanc/zosyn for 7days for PNA in recently hospitalized patient
   on vent.
   - On flagyl empirically for SBP
   - Urine culture grew Group B strep, was on PCN G, but d/c'ed when
   started other abx
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt w/ ARF as evidenced by elevated BUN and Cr
   to 46 and 2.2 on admission, up from baseline BUN [**6-21**] and baseline Cr
   0.8-1.0.
   - IVF for pre-renal azotemia.  UOP has been >30mL/hour.
   - consider albumin for ARF given concern for hepato-renal syndrome.
   Will continue with crystalloid at this time.  However, low threshold to
   add albumin
   - holding diuretics (Lasix, spironolactone)
   - holding diltiazem for now as unclear if pt takes this at home
   #. Hyperkalemia - Pt w/ elevated K to 5.5 on admission, received
   Kayexelate in ED but likely not absorbed as pt had emesis on arrival to
   ICU. ECG without hyperkalemic changes.
   - K+ wnl
   - cont to follow
   #. Hepatic sarcoidosis w/ regenerative hyperplasia - Pt is s/p TIPS x2.
   Currently on Ursodiol at home. LFTs WNL on arrival, Ammonia elevated as
   above.
   - cont home dose of Ursodiol, on hydrocort (at home takes prednisone)
   - cont home vitamins (MVI / thiamine / folate, iron)
   - cont lactulose as above, titrate to 3 BMs/day
   -cont home PPI.  No sucralfate given SBO
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home dose of levothyroxine
   #. Thrombocytopenia- currently at 60k, down from 119k at admission.
   Concerning for pre-formed HIT abs.  Will check.  If positive, most
   likely due to heparin coated central line and would req replacement
   with heparin free line.
   -Called lab re antibodies and informed that this is a send out lab and
   will not have results for several days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with hepatic sarcoidosis and regenerative hyperplasia, who has undergone two transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for encephalopathy. The patient presented with asterixis and a concern for impending encephalopathy. She has a history of acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypothyroidism, thrombocytopenia, hypocalcemia, and hypoglycemia. The patient is currently on various medications including lactulose, albumin, ursodiol, hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, and prednisone. She also receives total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and insulin for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines including a 20-gauge and multi-lumen line. She is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's husband has been informed about her condition, and she has a full code status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with hepatic sarcoidosis who was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has a small bowel obstruction, as indicated by the presence of an NG tube in place. The plan is to continue NPO with the NG tube clamped and check for residual after 3 hours. If the residual volume is low, the NG tube can be pulled. The patient should be monitored for bowel movements and abdominal exams.

2. Anemia: The patient has acute normocytic anemia, which may be due to dilutional effects as well as phlebotomy. The patient's Hct has dropped from 41 at presentation to 24 currently, suggesting active bleeding. The plan is to perform guiac testing on all stools, recheck Hct this afternoon, and consider CT/liver for EGD if the Hct continues to drop. Hemolysis labs should also be done.

3. Hepatic Sarcoidosis c/b encephalopathy s/p TIPs times 2: The patient's hepatic sarcoidosis may be causing encephalopathy, and she has undergone two transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPs). The patient's condition has improved compared to admission,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55-F w/ hepatic sarcoidosis with regenerative hyperplasia c/b variceal
   bleeding, portal hypertensive gastropathy, TIPs * 2 after
   angioplasty/portal vein embolectomy admitted to the MICU on [**10-9**] for
   encephalopathy and acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
   #. Small Bowel Obstruction
 NG tube in place, currently on suction;
   now stooling
   -check with surgery
 if ok, d/c NG
   -follow BMs, abdominal exams
   #. Anemia
 acute normocytic anemia; some component of this is likely
   dilutional as well as [**3-15**] phlebotomy but Hct drop from 41 at
   presentation to 24 currently is worrisome for active bleeding
   responded appropriately to pRBCs yesterday and stools heme negative
   which is reassuring
   -guiac all stools
   -recheck Hct this afternoon, if continuing to drop transfuse and
   consider CT/liver for EGD
   #. Respiratory decompensation o/n
 now stable and at baseline
   -likely [**3-15**] fluid overload
   -will talk with blood bank to determine if patient needs work up for
   TRALI r/o
   #. Hepatic Sarcoidosis c/b encephalopathy s/p TIPs times 2
 improved
   as compared to admission, some concern for HRS
   - monitor encephalopathy clinically
   - lactulose pr, titrate to 3 BMs / day
 convert to PO once NG tube
   pulled
   - continue to hold all sedating meds (gabapentin, amitryptyline,
   zolpidem)
   - per liver, will need TIPs revision once SBO resolved; empiric flagyl
   to prevent bacterial translocation (cipro allergy)
   - cont home ursodiol, on hydrocort (at home takes prednisone), MVI,
   thiamine, folate, iron, PPI (no sucralfate [**3-15**] SBO)
   #. VAP
 afebrile, no leukocytosis currently
 on zosyn
   -complete 8 day course antibiotics to end [**10-19**]
   #. ARF
 1.2 today, trending towards baseline 1.0, adequate UOP
   -continue fluids, albumin PRN
   -holding lasix, spironolactone
   #. UTI
 group B strep, on zosyn
   -continue zosyn for 7 day course
   #. Hypothyroidism
 continue home levothyroxine

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with hepatic sarcoidosis who was admitted to the ICU for encephalopathy and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. The patient underwent angioplasty and portal vein embolectomy, after which she developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has been on nasogastric (NG) tube suction and is currently stooling. The plan is to check with surgery to determine if the NG tube can be discontinued.

The patient also has acute normocytic anemia, which is likely due to dilutional effects as well as phlebotomy. Her hematocrit (Hct) has dropped from 41 at presentation to 24 currently, which is concerning for active bleeding. The patient responded appropriately to packed red blood cells (pRBCs) yesterday and her stools are heme negative, which is reassuring. The plan is to guiac all stools and recheck Hct this afternoon. If the Hct continues to drop, transfusion will be continued and consideration will be given to a CT/liver for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of bleeding.

Additionally, the patient experienced respiratory decompensation overnight but is now stable and at baseline. This was likely due to fluid overload. The plan is to talk with the blood bank to determine if the patient needs a workup for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) rule out.

The patient has"
