   61 year old male with a h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2144**], chronic
   systolic heart failure (EF 20%), recurrent VT s/p ICD placement and
   atrial fibrillation transferred to the CCU for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely related to unstable rhythm of atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and rate related left
   bundle.  Unclear why internal ICD did not fire for rhythm.  S/p
   attempted internal and successful external DC/CV with resolution of
   hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm intermittently paced.
   Concerning for infectious process as well given erythematous left lower
   extremity.
   - Attempt to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics if spikes
   - Small fluid boluses PRN, pressors as needed
   - Hold spironolactone, sotalol and ace-I for now
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of Afib, h/o VT, now with several
   episodes of VT and Afib with RVR s/p external dc/cv. Pt now in sinus
   rhythm with intermittent pacing.
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - Continue amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm
   - Will hold sotalol for now, may decide to restart and stop amiodarone
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue home digoxin
   - f/u EP recs
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has an EF of 20% on echo in [**12-8**], likely ischemic
   cardiomyopathy in the setting of anterior MI in 95.  The patient was
   being treated for decompensated failure on the [**Hospital1 2259**] service with
   lasix.  CXR on admission to CCU shows mild volume overload.  Received
   100mg of IV lasix in transit, however no urine output currently.
   - monitor UOP, concern for ARF in the setting of hypotension
   - daily weights and strict I&Os - lasix PRN
   - continue home Simvastatin
   - continue home Midodrine, Digoxin for inotropic support
   - Hold Spiranolactone in the setting of hypotension
   - consider starting low dose ACE-I
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a known history of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG
   in [**2144**] and anterior MI in [**2144**]. This episode is unlikely to be an
   acute MI given no chest pain prior.
   - Cycle enzymes today - may be elevated secondary to DC/CV
   - Continue aspirin and simvastatin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely secondary to poor perfusion state.
   Administered calcium gluconate, glucose, insulin, sodium bicarb and
   albuterol.
   - Recheck K
   - Administer kayexalate
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: [**1-1**] to Amiodarone toxicity, currently no symptoms.
   Restarted amiodarone emergently, will decide when to stop and restart
   sotalol.
   - continue home Levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) post-implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation (AF).
- The patient was transferred to the CCU for hypotension and was found to be in AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He received external defibrillation (DC/CV) with resolution of hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm intermittently paced.
- The patient has a history of VT and AF, and is currently experiencing episodes of VT and AF with RVR. He is now in sinus rhythm with intermittent pacing.
- The patient has an EF of 20% on echo and likely ischemic cardiomyopathy due to an anterior MI in 1995. He was being treated for decompensated heart failure with lasix. His chest X-ray shows mild volume overload.
- The patient has a known history of CAD s/p 5-vessel CABG in 2004 and anterior MI in 2004. This episode is unlikely to be an acute MI given no chest pain prior.
- The patient has hyperkalemia likely secondary to poor perfusion"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypotension and unstable rhythm of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's current medical conditions include chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient's recent events include arterial line placement, invasive ventilation, unplanned extubation, and the initiation of various medications such as heparin, amiodarone, dextrose, furosemide (Lasix), and others. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) between 76-80 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 132/91 to 138/97 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between 14-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), slightly elevated platelet count (Plt), and elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values are within normal limits or"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old male with a h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2144**], chronic
   systolic heart failure (EF 20%), recurrent VT s/p ICD placement and
   atrial fibrillation transferred to the CCU for hypotension in the
   setting of VT.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely related to unstable rhythm of wide-complex
   tachycardia, namely VT.  Unclear why internal ICD did not fire for
   rhythm (EP changed pacer settings yesterday based upon this concern).
   S/p attempted internal and successful external DC/CV with resolution of
   hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm intermittently paced.
   Concerning for infectious process as well given erythematous left lower
   extremity. Now patient
s hypotension significantly improved s/p
   extubation.
   - Attempt to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics if spikes
   - Hold spironolactone, sotalol, digoxin and ace-I for now d/t
   hypotension and renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of Afib, h/o VT, now with several
   episodes of VT and Afib with RVR s/p external dc/cv. Pt now in sinus
   rhythm with pacing.
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - Continue amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm
   - Will hold sotalol for now, may decide to restart and stop amiodarone
   - monitor on telemetry
   - d/c digoxin (d/t renal failure)
   - f/u EP recs
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has an EF of 20% on echo in [**12-8**], likely ischemic
   cardiomyopathy in the setting of anterior MI in 95.  The patient was
   being treated for decompensated failure on the [**Hospital1 2259**] service with
   lasix.  CXR on admission to CCU shows mild volume overload.  Now
   putting out significant urine to lasix; Cr rising.
   - goal I
s & O
s: >1L out today; use lasix gtt to titrate to this goal
   - monitor UOP, concern for ARF in the setting of hypotension and rising
   Cr
   - daily weights and strict I&Os
   - continue home Simvastatin, midodrine, spinolocatone
   - d/c digoxin d/t renal failure
   - consider starting low dose ACE-I; as cardiologist first
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a known history of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG
   in [**2144**] and anterior MI in [**2144**]. This episode is unlikely to be an
   acute MI given no chest pain prior. Cardiac enzymes peaked and now
   downtrending.
   - Continue aspirin and simvastatin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely secondary to poor perfusion state.
   Administered calcium gluconate, glucose, insulin, sodium bicarb and
   albuterol, and kayexelate. Corrected today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: [**1-1**] to Amiodarone toxicity, currently no symptoms.
   Restarted amiodarone emergently, will decide when to stop and restart
   sotalol.
   - continue home Levothyroxine
   .
   # LLE Erythema and R heel ulcer: concerning for site of infection.  If
   the patient has an elevated temp or drops pressure again will consider
   starting Vanc for MRSA coverage.
   - wound care
   .
   # Insomnia: stable
   - continue home Ativan PRN and Ambien
   .
   # Depression: stable. per pt, was switched to half-dose because he was
   dc'd on it completely upon last hospital discharge. so, psychiatrist
   started half dose to taper it.
   - continue buproprion 50mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - sw c/s for med noncompliance

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction of 20%), recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) post-implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation. The patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension in the setting of VT.

The patient experienced hypotension, which was likely related to the unstable rhythm of wide-complex tachycardia, namely VT. Despite having an internal ICD, the rhythm did not fire. The patient underwent attempted internal and successful external defibrillation/cardioversion (DC/CV) with resolution of hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm intermittently paced.

The patient's rhythm has been a concern, with several episodes of VT and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) post-external DC/CV. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with pacing. Heparin is being administered for anticoagulation, and amiodarone is being used to maintain sinus rhythm. Sotalol has been held for now, but may be restarted and amiodarone discontinued. Telemetry monitoring will continue.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presented to the ICU with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and hypotension. The patient was transferred from the coronary care unit for management of hypotension associated with wide-complex tachycardia. An internal cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) did not fire, so external defibrillation was performed. The patient's hypotension improved after extubation. 

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with amiodarone. His renal function is impaired, as indicated by a rising creatinine level. 

The patient's current medications include simvastatin, midodrine, spironolactone, and aspirin. He is also on heparin for anticoagulation. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated potassium levels and anemia. His cardiac enzymes are within normal range. 

The patient has a history of depression and insomnia, and he is currently taking bupropion and Ativan for these conditions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include hypotension, recurrent VT, heart failure exacerbation, hyperkalemia, hypothyroidism, infection, and renal failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure puts him at risk for further deterioration in cardiac function, leading to worsening symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid accumulation, and decreased cardiac output.

2. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, which increases the risk of recurrent arrhythmias. This can lead to hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening situations.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Although the note mentions that the patient does not have ARDS, it is still important to monitor for any signs of respiratory deterioration, as the patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure. The risk of developing ARDS should be closely monitored, especially if there are any changes in oxygenation or pulmonary function.

4. Renal function deterioration: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to further deterioration in kidney function. This can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and wound infections. Proper skin assessment and intervention to"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old male with a h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2144**], chronic
   systolic heart failure (EF 20%), recurrent VT s/p ICD placement and
   atrial fibrillation transferred to the CCU for hypotension in the
   setting of VT.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely related to unstable rhythm of wide-complex
   tachycardia, namely VT.  Unclear why internal ICD did not fire for
   rhythm (EP changed pacer settings yesterday based upon this concern).
   S/p attempted internal and successful external DC/CV with resolution of
   hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm intermittently paced.
   Concerning for infectious process as well given erythematous left lower
   extremity. Now patient
s hypotension significantly improved s/p
   extubation.
   - Attempt to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics if spikes
   - Hold spironolactone, sotalol, digoxin and ace-I for now d/t
   hypotension and renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of Afib, h/o VT, now with several
   episodes of VT and Afib with RVR s/p external dc/cv. Pt now in sinus
   rhythm with pacing.
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - Continue amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm
   - Will hold sotalol for now, may decide to restart and stop amiodarone
   - monitor on telemetry
   - d/c digoxin (d/t renal failure)
   - f/u EP recs
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has an EF of 20% on echo in [**12-8**], likely ischemic
   cardiomyopathy in the setting of anterior MI in 95.  The patient was
   being treated for decompensated failure on the [**Hospital1 2259**] service with
   lasix.  CXR on admission to CCU shows mild volume overload.  Now
   putting out significant urine to lasix; Cr rising.
   - goal I
s & O
s: >1L out today; use lasix gtt to titrate to this goal
   - monitor UOP, concern for ARF in the setting of hypotension and rising
   Cr
   - daily weights and strict I&Os
   - continue home Simvastatin, midodrine, spinolocatone
   - d/c digoxin d/t renal failure
   - consider starting low dose ACE-I; as cardiologist first
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a known history of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG
   in [**2144**] and anterior MI in [**2144**]. This episode is unlikely to be an
   acute MI given no chest pain prior. Cardiac enzymes peaked and now
   downtrending.
   - Continue aspirin and simvastatin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely secondary to poor perfusion state.
   Administered calcium gluconate, glucose, insulin, sodium bicarb and
   albuterol, and kayexelate. Corrected today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: [**1-1**] to Amiodarone toxicity, currently no symptoms.
   Restarted amiodarone emergently, will decide when to stop and restart
   sotalol.
   - continue home Levothyroxine
   .
   # LLE Erythema and R heel ulcer: concerning for site of infection.  If
   the patient has an elevated temp or drops pressure again will consider
   starting Vanc for MRSA coverage.
   - wound care
   .
   # Insomnia: stable
   - continue home Ativan PRN and Ambien
   .
   # Depression: stable. per pt, was switched to half-dose because he was
   dc'd on it completely upon last hospital discharge. so, psychiatrist
   started half dose to taper it.
   - continue buproprion 50mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - sw c/s for med noncompliance
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 36 today, at baseline.
   - continue to monitor
   - consider Fe studies
   .
   # Elev INR: unclear etiology (perhaps [**1-1**] to hepatic congestion from
   heart failure), off anticoagulation bc of h/o GIB
   - continue to monitor
   - check LFTs
   - on heparin gtt

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient was admitted to the critical care unit for hypotension related to unstable wide-complex tachycardia. He underwent internal and external defibrillation with resolution of hypotension and restoration of intermittent pacing. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely related to the unstable rhythm of wide-complex tachycardia, specifically ventricular tachycardia. It is unclear why the internal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator did not fire for the rhythm. The patient's hypotension significantly improved after external defibrillation and restoration of sinus rhythm with pacing.

2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. He experienced several episodes of ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with pacing and is being monitored on telemetry. The plan includes continuing amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm,"
