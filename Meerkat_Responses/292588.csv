   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Resolving with no acidosis this morning and BS
   which are stabilizing.  Pt got home dose of glargine last night with
   HISS for correction.  Now off IV fluids and eating well.
   - continue to check FSBS q4-6 hours (qACHS)
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 now resolved, unclear etiology but probably stress
   response from DKA.
   .
   #Pancreatitis
 unclear etiology, pt has been vomiting
   - recheck amylase and lipase this AM
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - resolved
   .
   #Altered Mental Status
 most likely from severe DKA, appears to be
   improving.
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehydration. MB index trending down, troponin elevation may be
   in the setting of renal failure.
   - getting ASA
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct, outpatient workup
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -clonidine restarted yesterday for hypertension
   .
   # Depression
 per psych, may need inpatient psych once medically
   cleared.  Psych is following.
   - continue to provide emotional support
   #FEN
 diabetic diet, repleting lytes frequently (especially potassium)
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #Code Status - presumed full
   .
   #HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 765**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3387**] (father); mother is [**Name (NI) 3388**]

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  38 yo F with DMI c/b vascular ds, global
   systolic CHF with EF 30
s, recent BKA, and depression, admitted  from
   group home with DKA and altered mental status, also noted to have tox +
   cocaine, leukocytosis, LFT elevations and chemical pancreatitis.  Gap
   closed and BS controlled on glargine, RSSI, off insulin gtt.
   Transfused 1 U PRBCs for significant anemia with approp bump.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4   BP 133/73  HR 80
s RR 10-15 with sat 99% on
   RA. + 1 L/24 hrs.  Awake and alert, easily tearful, + thrush, MMM, CTA,
   benign abd, RR, BKA site healing, no LE edema; Labs notable for WBC 8.7
   HCT 23.9 (20.3), Na 135, K 3.5 bicarb 21 cr 1.4, glucose 84, trop 1.02
   (up), A  and lfts pending; CXR--no new film
   Agree with plan to continue glargine and humalog. Tolerating
   POs. Fluids off.  MS improved.  ARF appears prerenal in setting of DKA,
   improved to baseline with hydration with good u/o. Continue to follow
   lytes at least [**Hospital1 7**]. Leukocytosis has resolved, likely stress response
   with no clear infectious source identified.  NSTEMI/trop leak is likely
   demand, + cocaine
trop trending down, continue asa, s/p 1 unit PRBCs
   given significant anemia with appropraite bump and now close to
   baseline.  Would continue to follow h/h and check anemia w/u.  Altered
   MS
[**First Name (Titles) 1418**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3412**] in setting of cocaine and DKA/toxic metabolic,
   head CT neg, and depression--now alert and oriented X 3.  Psych c/s
   appreciated.  Chemical pancreatitis
 remains asx and tolerating POs,
   trend a/l.  Check hep serologies and consider liver imaging (elevated
   ggt). D/c fem line and place peripherals. Stable for floor transfer.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Total time: 40 min
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 215**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], MD
   on:[**2111-12-13**] 03:10 PM ------
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of depression, recent below-knee amputation (BKA), and multiple medical conditions including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute renal failure, NSTEMI, pancreatitis, and hypertension.

The patient presented with DKA, pancreatitis, and altered mental status. She was found to have leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, anemia, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's blood glucose levels were initially high but have been brought under control with insulin therapy.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's DKA is resolving, and her blood sugars are stabilizing. She has been given a dose of glargine at home for correction. She is now off IV fluids and eating well. The plan is to continue checking fasting blood sugar (FSBS) every 4-6 hours and maintain a goal glucose level of 150-200 mg/dL.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, likely due to stress response from DKA. The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, but it may be related to the patient's recent hospitalization and illness.

3. Pancreatitis: The cause of pancreatitis is unclear, and the patient has been experiencing vomiting. It is recommended to recheck amylase and lipase levels this morning"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of depression, major depressive disorder (DMI), and previous vascular disease presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C (95.8°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 133/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's mental status is improving, and she is oriented to person, place, and year. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt). Her creatinine level has returned to baseline, indicating resolution of acute renal failure. Electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia and hypokalemia have also resolved. Troponin levels are elevated but trending down, suggesting myocardial ischemia. 

The patient's anemia is likely chronic rather than acute, and her hypertension is currently well-controlled. The patient's depression is being managed with psych support. 

The patient's current medications include glargine for insulin, clonidine for hypertension, omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: unclear cause for DKA however pancreatitis is
   most likely possibility at this time given significantly elevated
   amylase and lipase.  Other source of infection also possible given
   significantly elevated WBC.  Urine positive for cocaine which could
   also be contributing.
   -continue insulin gtt, monitor glucose Q1-2 hours, with goal of
   decreasing glucose by 100 every 4 hours
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   -will add D5 to IVF once serum glucose reaches 200
   -monitor K q2 hours, add KCL to IVF once K <5.3
   -check ABG to evaluate pH, may need NaHCO3 pH <7
   -change over to 1/2 NS once hyponatremia resolves to avoid non-gap
   acidosis
   -start SQ insulin once anion gap closes and glucose <200, then stop IV
   insulin gtt
   -treat underlying trigger
   .
   #Leukocytosis - concerning for possible infection although no obvious
   source at this time, patient is currently poor hisotrian.  CXR without
   infiltrate, consider repeating in AM once hydrated.  Urine without
   obvious infection.  Other possible cause is pancreatitis given elevated
   [**Doctor First Name **]/lip.
   -keep NPO, monitor [**Doctor First Name **]/lip; hold off on CT for now
   -f/u urine cx
   -f/u blood cx
   -send stool cx for C.diff if stooling
   -d/c antibiotics for now as most likely cause is pancreatitis
   .
   #Pancreatitis - possible cause for DKA
   -monitor amylase/lipase
   -NPO
   -monitor/treat associated symptoms ie. pain/nausea
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehdration.  Creatine
   improving with hydration.
   -continue with IVF
   -trend creatinine
   -renally dose all medications
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - got IV calcium gluconate, Insulin in the ED, with
   potassium down to 5.2 prior to arrival on the floor.
   -Will monitor labs q1-2 hour
   -add 20-40mEQ KCL to NS IV once K <5.3.
   .
   #Altered Mental Status -> unclear [**Name2 (NI) 3360**], most likely due to severe
   DKA and metabolic derangements.  Tox screen also positive for cocaine
   which could be contributing.
   -monitor mental status
   -talk with family about baseline
   .
   #Elevated Alk Phos -> appears to be chronic of unclear etiology with
   elevated GGT as well.  Had abdominal ultrasound of liver in [**8-11**] which
   was unrevealing.
   -curbside liver service re: ? further imaging
   -repeat GGT with AM labs
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehdration, although given h/o DM1 and vascular disease as well
   as recent cocaine use, ACS is possible.
   -trend CE's x 3 at least
   -follow serial EKG's
   -continue ASA
   -holding BB for now as her BP is borderline, will resume metoprolol
   when more stable
   -consider cardiology consultation in the am if enzymes still trending
   up.
   -hold statin for now given concern for acute infection/pancreatitis
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct
   -iron studies, b12, folate
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -hold clonidine for now, resume once BP more stable to aviod rebound
   hypertension
   #FEN - NPO for now until mental status improves, replete lytes as
   above, IVF as above
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #Code Status - presumed full
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications include:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient is presenting with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. The cause of DKA is unclear but pancreatitis is the most likely possibility at this time.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has significantly elevated amylase and lipase levels, indicating pancreatitis. Pancreatitis can be a cause of DKA and may also contribute to the elevated white blood cell count.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated from a baseline of 2.4 to 4.2 on admission, indicating acute renal failure. This is likely due to pre-renal etiology from dehydration, but further evaluation is needed.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which have been managed with insulin and IV calcium gluconate. Monitoring labs every 1-2 hours and adding KCL to NS IV when necessary will be done to maintain potassium levels within the normal range.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to severe DKA and metabolic derangements. The positive tox screen for cocaine could also be contributing to the altered mental status.

6. Elevated troponin: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may indicate demand ischemia or acute"
