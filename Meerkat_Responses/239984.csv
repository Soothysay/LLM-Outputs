   #. Mechanical ventilation: No acute pulmonary pathology, intubated for
   airway protection given mental status.
   - Extubate when mental status clearing after procedures (LP left to do)
   .
   #. Fungemia: TEE negative, consider other intravascular sources like
   PICC or clot.  CrAg negative. Final speciation pending but likely not
   albicans.
   - f/u punch biopsy by derm for possible emboli
   - f/u final culture
   - Surveillance blood cultures

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and a complicated medical course. The patient presents with altered mental status and fungemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:
1. Altered mental status: The differential includes septic emboli, generalized sepsis, encephalitis, or chemo effects. The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as septic emboli, generalized sepsis, encephalitis, or side effects of chemotherapy (Ara-C or iphosphamide). Further investigations such as MRI head, LP post MRI, keeping sedation light, and monitoring for septic emboli are recommended.
2. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is intubated for airway protection given mental status. Extubation may be considered when the mental status clears after procedures.
3. Cardiovascular: There is a suspicion of fungal endocarditis given the presence of spots and fungemia. Monitoring EKGs for interval prolongation, performing TEE, surveillance blood cultures, and administering Ambisome are recommended.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's baseline renal function shows a creatinine level of 1.5-1.6, currently at 1.8. Possible causes include septic emboli or prerenal issues. Further evaluation with urine lytes"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) who has been hospitalized for three months. He is currently undergoing treatment for NHL and has developed several complications, including PE (pulmonary embolism), PCP (presumptive Pneumocystis pneumonia), and cholecystitis. The patient has also been found to have altered mental status (AMS) and acute respiratory failure. Additionally, the patient has anemia and fungal sepsis.

The patient's current medical plan includes:

1. AMS - Intermittently follows commands. Needs to be concerned about CNS involvement, especially given new infarct on MRI. Plan to perform LP (lumbar puncture).
2. Acute respiratory failure - intubated on vent for airway protection/Oxygenation and ventilation adequate.
3. Hypotension - intermittently hypotensive, though not requiring pressors. Resuscitate as needed, consider a-line if persistent.
4. Fungal sepsis - species not yet identified. Concern for embolism - no cardiac source seen by Echo, but did have PICC (peripheral inserted central catheter) which has been pulled. On ambisome.
5. ARF (acute renal failure) - unchanged renal function, continue to renally dose meds.
6. NHL - per BMT (bone marrow transplant) team. Recently completed [Last Name LF 2051], [First Name3 LF] counts are expected to nadir in the middle of next week. Has remained transfusion-dependent and will continue to support.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (multi-lumen and 18-gauge), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP), and code status. The patient is critically ill."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and has been hospitalized for three months. The patient underwent a procedure called [**Name (NI)**] and has developed several complications since then. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, presumed PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), and a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also developed a yeast infection in the blood cultures and subsequently had a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). 

The patient's condition has deteriorated, resulting in altered mental status (AMS), acute respiratory failure, anemia, and fungal sepsis. The patient's MRI shows evidence of a new infarct, raising concerns about CNS involvement. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for airway protection and oxygenation. The patient's blood pressure is intermittently low but not requiring vasopressors. 

The patient is being treated with ambisome for fungal sepsis, and methylene blue has been started for possible component of iphosphamide toxicity. Sedation is being weaned as tolerated to assess mental status. 

Other ongoing plans include managing acute respiratory failure, treating fungal sepsis, monitoring and managing hypotension, and addressing anemia. 

The patient's NHL treatment will be managed by the BMT (bone marrow transplant) team."

   that patient
s infarcts on MRI likely do not correlate to patient
   clinical status.  LP was unremarkable
 gram stain negative, protein
   and glucose negative.  Patient was originally intubated because of his
   mental status, favor extubation today.

   #. Fungemia:  No clear speciation, likely [**Female First Name (un) **], but not albacans.
   No clear source as TEE negative, consider other intravascular sources.
    Given that patient has cortical infarcts, renal insufficiency there is
   a possibility that patient could be passing septic emboli.  Patient
   clinically has improved, no source yet.  Has been on ambisome to cover
   for CNS penetration, but in light of negative LP, may favor switching

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with NHL (Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma) who presents with altered mental status, evolving stroke, and fungemia. The patient's altered mental status has resolved, and he is now responding to commands. The MRI shows no evidence of meningeal or parenchymal enhancement suggestive of metastatic disease or brain abscess. The patient's mechanical ventilation is being considered for extubation today as there is no acute pulmonary pathology and he is intubated for airway protection due to mental status. The source of fungemia is unclear, and the patient has been on ambisome to cover for CNS penetration. There is a possibility of passing septic emboli given the cortical infarcts and renal insufficiency. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he is being monitored for any recurrence. His CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) is worsening, possibly prerenal, and he is being monitored. The patient's hyperglycemia is being checked while on dexamethasone. He received PPI, bowel reg, pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia, Bactrim for PCP, and [**Name10 (NameIs)**] for previous neutropenia. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) until his MS (mental status) improves. He has PIV and L IJ TLC (peripheral intravenous line and large joint"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and a complicated medical course. He presents with altered mental status, evolving stroke, and fungemia. The patient is currently sedated and intubated for mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status and airway protection. The MRI head shows a previous left basal ganglia putaminal abnormality, which appears to be an evolving subacute lacunar infarct. There is also a new subtle hyperintensity in the right parietal subcortical region, most likely representing a subacute infarct. No evidence of meningeal or parenchymal enhancement is seen, ruling out metastatic disease or brain abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: This could be due to the evolving stroke in the putamen. However, there are no focal signs on the exam, and it could also be attributed to generalized sepsis or chemotherapy effects.
2. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently intubated for airway protection given the mental status. It is planned to extubate when the mental status clears after procedures (LP left to do).
3. Fungemia: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of fungemia, with negative TEE and CrAg. Surveillance blood cultures are being done, and final speciation is pending but likely not albicans.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and a complicated medical course. He presents with altered mental status, subacute stroke, and fungemia. The patient's altered mental status has improved slightly, and he is now extubated and able to protect his airway. The most likely causes of his altered mental status are toxic metabolic from infection and ifosfamide toxicity. The patient will be monitored for further improvement, and it is recommended to follow up with hematology/oncology regarding the discontinuation of methylene blue and the expected resolution of his altered mental status due to ifosfamide toxicity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as infection, medication toxicity, or stroke. Close monitoring of his neurologic status and communication with the neurology team are necessary.
2. Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with fungemia caused by Candida species. It is important to continue aggressive hydration to prevent renal toxicity and consider the sensitivity of the fungus for appropriate antifungal therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension, which needs to be closely monitored. Further investigation may be required to identify the underlying cause.
4. CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease): The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of NHL (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and a complicated medical course. He presents with altered mental status, subacute stroke, and fungemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/69 to 139/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is extubated and tolerating it well. He has a history of renal insufficiency, as evidenced by a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 38 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.6 mmol/L. The patient is being treated with Ambisome for fungemia and methylene blue for possible ifosfamide toxicity. Neurological examination is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors, including toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infection or ifosfamide toxicity. Monitoring the patient's neurological status and adjusting treatment accordingly is crucial.
2. Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with fungemia, likely caused by Candid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and long-term complications. He presented with altered mental status, evolving stroke, and fungemia. His condition has shown improvement, but he still faces potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved, but it is essential to continue monitoring for any changes or deterioration.
2. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. Although he has been successfully extubated, there may be a need for reintubation if his mental status worsens.
3. Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with fungemia, likely caused by Candida species. Despite improvements in clinical status, there is still a possibility of septic emboli due to cortical infarcts and renal insufficiency. Continuing antifungal therapy is crucial, and the source of infection should be identified and addressed.
4. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, but it has resolved. Close monitoring is necessary to detect any recurrence.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level increasing from 1.9 to 2.1. Further evaluation is required to determine the cause and appropriate management.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with NHL and long complicated course presents with altered
   mental status and fungemia s/p chemo.
   #. Altered mental status:  Stable to slightly improved.  Patient is
   responding to commands and sedation has been.  Per neurology it is
   unlikely that his MRI finding of stroke is causing his altered mental
   status.  LP was essentially negative, no WBCs, but some cultures still
   pending.  Has been protecting airway well.   Differential diagnosis
   includes toxic/metabolic from infection but also could be ifosphamide
   or ara-c so may take weeks for this to resolve.
          -     Per heme/onc will continue methylene blue for now though
   should have worked by now
   -          D/c sedation
   -          Full neuro exam once patient awake and cooperative
   -          Continue treatment of candidemia
   -          Continue steroids for intrathecal ara-c toxicity
   .
   #. Candidemia: [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5744**]. Likely intravascular source other
   than heart, suspect infected clot. Given increased Cr likely [**1-11**]
   ambisome will switch back to micafungin as no e/o CNS infection
   - f/u final culture/ sensitivities
   - discontinue ambisome
   - restart micafungin but at 150mg/day
   .
   #?hypotension: intermittent, likely inaccurate readings on automated
   cuff as no change in HR or rhythm during these episodes and they
   resolve spontaneously. Could possibly be related to level of arousal.
   [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was WNL.
   - Limit NS boluses given hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
   .
   #. Acute on chronic CKD: Likely [**1-11**] ambisome vs. chemo effect.
   - Ulytes/anion gap
   - d/c ambisome
   .
   #. Hyperglycemia: Checking sugars, on dexamethasone
   - ISS
   .
   #. PPx: PPI, Bowel reg, pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia, Bactrim for
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] for previous neutrapenia.
   .
   #. FEN
 NPO for now, until patient
s MS improves.  If no improvement
   soon will consider TF but will likely be neutrapenic and NGT would
   increase risk of infection.
   .
   #. Access - PIV and L IJ TLC

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who presented with altered mental status and candidemia following chemotherapy. The patient's altered mental status has been stable to slightly improved, and he is responding to commands. The MRI findings of stroke do not appear to be causing the altered mental status. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed, which showed no white blood cells (WBCs) but some cultures are still pending.

The patient has been protecting his airway well. The differential diagnosis for the altered mental status includes toxic/metabolic causes from infection, as well as possible side effects from chemotherapy drugs ifosfamide or ara-c. It may take weeks for this to resolve.

The patient is currently receiving methylene blue, but its effectiveness has not been seen yet. Sedation is being discontinued, and a full neuro exam will be conducted once the patient is awake and cooperative. Treatment for candidemia will continue, and steroids for intrathecal ara-c toxicity will also be continued.

The patient's blood pressure has been intermittent and likely inaccurate readings on the automated cuff. These episodes resolve spontaneously and could possibly be related to the level of arousal. Stim was within normal limits.

The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.1, indicating acute on chronic chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is likely due to the use of ambisome or chemotherapy effect. Monitoring of electrolytes and anion gap"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of lymphoma who presented with altered mental status. He was intubated upon admission and extubated yesterday. His current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 119/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on insulin and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flow sheet data shows stable hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is not on any respiratory support devices and has an oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 38 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, decreased platelet count of 57 K/uL, and increased creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium, low sodium, and normal chloride levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been relatively stable.

The patient's physical examination reveals lethargy and eyes closed. The assessment and plan include altered mental status, likely due to his history of lymphoma, hypotension, fungal infection, acute respiratory failure, and other conditions. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently in the ICU."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who is currently in the ICU. The patient presents with altered mental status and fungemia following chemotherapy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/67 mmHg to 75/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,241 mL and output of 1,430 mL, resulting in a balance of 811 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and nasal cannula. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.15.

Physical examination reveals lethargy, distal heart sounds, clear lungs anteriorly, soft abdomen with no tenderness or guarding, and 2+ pitting edema of the feet bilaterally. Neurological examination shows no deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) in the knee or ankle bilaterally, and no clonus.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.8, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 6.6 g/dL, serum creatinine (Cr) of 2.4 mg/dL, blood glucose of 119 mg/dL, sodium (Na) of 140 mEq/L, potassium (K) of 4.3 mEq/L, calcium (Ca) of 7.6 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg) of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) of 3.5 mg/dL.

The patient has several pending lab results, including differential, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and urinalysis.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status, likely due to toxic/metabolic effects from infection or chemotherapy agents such as ifosphamide or ara-c. The patient is expected to continue methylene blue for now, despite it not working as expected. Sedation will be discontinued, and a full neurological examination will be conducted once the patient is awake and cooperative. Treatment for candidemia will be continued, and steroids will be continued for intrathecal ara-c toxicity.

Other concerns include hypotension, which may be inaccurate readings on the automated cuff, intermittent episodes of hypotension that resolve spontaneously, and no change in heart rhythm during these episodes. This could be related to the patient's level of arousal. Stim was within normal limits.

Acute on chronic chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also noted, likely due to ambisome vs. chemotherapy effect. The patient"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who has been undergoing chemotherapy. He presents with altered mental status and fungemia following chemotherapy. The patient has shown significant improvement since admission, moving all extremities, alert, and conversant. He has been receiving intravenous methylene blue for four days. 

The assessment and plan include:
1. Ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy: Continue IV methylene blue, add B2 Microglob and LDH to CSF studies, check EEG for Spike and Wave pattern to confirm diagnosis.
2. Candidemia: Follow up final culture/sensitivities, continue Micafungin.
3. Hypotension: Bolus with D5 in Bicarb if necessary.
4. Acute on chronic CKD: Monitor renal function, bicarb with fluids if necessary.
5. Hyperglycemia: Check sugars, decrease dose of dexamethasone to 3mg daily.
6. Pancytopenia: Transfuse 2 units PRBCs, check post-transfusion HCT, recheck platelets, transfuse for PLT < 20, continue neutropenic precautions.
7. PPx: PPI, bowel reg, pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia, Bactrim for PCP, [Name10] for previous neutropenia.
8. FEN: Attempt nursing bedside swallow, advance to clears.
9. Access - L IJ TLC.
10. Code - Full. Wife is HCP, daughter is secondary HCP.
11. Dispo - To BMT floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of encephalopathy if methylene blue is not effective or if there are complications related to the underlying cause.
2. Candidemia may progress and lead to sepsis if the source of infection is not addressed or if the patient does not respond to antifungal treatment.
3. Hypotension could indicate poor perfusion and organ dysfunction if not managed appropriately.
4. Acute on chronic CKD may progress to renal failure if renal function is not monitored and managed properly.
5. Hyperglycemia may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or further complications if not controlled.
6. Pancytopenia may lead to increased risk of infection, bleeding, or other complications related to bone marrow suppression.
7. Thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding or require urgent platelet transfusion if platelet count continues to decrease.
8. Failure to regain swallowing function may lead to aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition if not managed appropriately.
9. The presence of a central line increases the risk of bloodstream infections or thrombosis if proper care is not taken.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition, follow the treatment plans, and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

   bleed.
   GI BLEED
 Painless GI bleed, large volume, without hemodynanic
   compromise
 suggest diverticular.  However, unable to exclude brisk
   UGI source, although would expect hemodynamic compromise.
   Thrombocytopenia likely contributing to bleeding diathesis.    Plan
   maintain iv, transfuse 4 units PRBCS, 6 pack of platelets, 1 FFP, GI
   consultation, General Surgery consultation.  Monitor serial Hct.  NPO.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to GI bleed on background of chemotherapy.  Monitir

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chronic kidney disease. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications including pneumonia, cholecystitis, fungemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and now presents with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient's medical history is significant for chemotherapy treatment for NHL, which may have contributed to immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to infections.

The patient's current condition includes painless GI bleeding, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypokalemia, altered mental status, fungemia, acute renal failure, and nutritional support pending GI evaluation. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Exsanguination: The large volume of dark stool and clots indicate active GI bleeding, which if not controlled, can lead to significant blood loss and potential exsanguination.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal range but may drop if the GI bleeding continues, leading to hypotension and hemodynamic instability.

3. Kidney injury: The patient has a background of chronic kidney disease and acute renal failure due to hypovolemia and medication (ambisome). The ongoing GI bleeding may further compromise renal function.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who has undergone one cycle of chemotherapy and is currently on day 8 of his second cycle of chemotherapy with ICE regimen. The patient presents with a large melanotic stool and blood clots, indicating a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's platelet count is low at 11, which increases the risk of bleeding.

The patient has a complicated hospital course including pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP), acute cholecystitis, and pulmonary embolism/disseminated intravascular coagulation (PE/DVT) for which a filter was placed. The patient also has a recent history of encephalitis likely due to chemotherapy effects and acute kidney injury (CKD) with a rise in creatinine from baseline.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications. The patient's altered mental status is slowly returning to baseline, and an EEG revealed encephalopathy while an MRI showed two small cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). The patient's renal function has deteriorated with an increase in creatinine from 1.5-1.6 to 2.6, and the differential diagnosis includes ambisome toxicity, chemotherapy toxicity, and pre-renal state in the setting of GI bleed. Anion gap is consistent with renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who has undergone one cycle of chemotherapy at Hospital1 and is currently on cycle 2 of ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) treatment.
- The patient has a complicated hospital course including pneumonia with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), acute cholecystitis, pulmonary embolism/diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (PE/DVT) with filter placement, and hemorrhage on anticoagulation.
- The patient presents with large melanicotic stools and blood clots, indicating a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- Hematocrit (HCT) has been stable overnight, and the patient's family has decided to avoid invasive procedures such as colonoscopy as the patient is clinically stable and their goal is to return home.
- The patient's platelet count is low (thrombocytopenia).
- The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 2.4, which could be due to ambisome, chemotherapy toxicity, pre-renal state in the setting of GI bleed, or renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
- The patient also has altered mental status likely due to encephalitis or chemotherapy effects, as well as two small cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who has undergone one cycle of chemotherapy and is currently on cycle 2 of the intensive chemotherapy regimen (ICE). The patient presents with a complicated hospital course, including pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP), acute cholecystitis, pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with placement of a filter, and hemorrhage on anticoagulation. The patient's current condition includes large melanic stool and blood clots, leading to a diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information are:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient's recent acute hematocrit drop on the day before the bloody bowel movement suggests a possible upper GI etiology with long transit time. It is important to consider this as a potential source of bleeding.

2. Diverticular bleed: Although the patient's exam is unremarkable and there is no history of GI bleeding or pathology, diverticular disease should still be considered as a possible cause of the GI bleed. This can be evaluated further through appropriate imaging studies.

3. Lower GI bleed: Given the presence of melanic stool and blood clots, it is also important to consider lower GI bleeding sources such as colonic lesions or inflammatory bowel disease.

4. Infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with NHL and admit with GIB to ICU.  He had prolonged course
   of hospitalization over past 70 days with altered mental status,
   fungemia, renal failure and now with evolution of acute GI bleed.  In
   this setting family has undergone extensive discussions and
   consideration of pathway for treatment going forward.  Current goals
   are care are dominated by desire to have patient able to return home
   even if care delivered would have to be modified and course of action
   may result in less time, this quality of life at home would outweigh
   duration in their mind at this time but is an ongoing discussion.
   1)GI Bleed-
   -Continue to transfuse as needed PLT and PRBC given continued bleeding
   -Bleeding scan, EGD and all approaches to identification of source
   explored and current plan of care directed at supportive care
   -PPI IV
   -HCT q 12 hours today with PLT count
   2)Neutropenia-
   -GCSF to continue
   3)Acute Renal Failure-[**Month (only) 8**] be medication related and possible component
   of pre-renal insult in the setting of fungal infection

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He has had a prolonged hospitalization of 70 days and is experiencing altered mental status, fungemia, renal failure, and now an acute GI bleed. The family has discussed the treatment pathway and the current goals of care are focused on allowing the patient to return home, despite potential modifications in care and a shorter life expectancy. 

The patient's vital signs show hypothermia with a temperature of 35.1°C (95.1°F), tachycardia with a heart rate of 84 bpm, stable blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and his breath sounds are diminished bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the extremities show 2+ edema. Neurological examination is not performed.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 38 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, low glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. GI Bleed - Continue to"
