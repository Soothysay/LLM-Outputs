   presents with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis and polyuria,
   polydipsia, fatigue and weight loss consistent with new onset diabetes
   and HHKS vs DKA.  Likely HHKS with some element of ketosis from
   prolonged hyperglycemia (duration of symptoms 2 months) and severe beta

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of GERD and tobacco use. He presents with hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, and weight loss consistent with new onset diabetes and HHKS vs DKA. The patient likely has severe beta cell dysfunction and is more likely to have HHKS with some element of ketosis from prolonged hyperglycemia. The patient has no prior history of diabetes.

Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia/Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has high blood glucose levels, an elevated anion gap, and ketonuria. The corrected sodium level was 155. With aggressive fluid repletion, the patient's glucose level has decreased, and the anion gap has closed to 8. The goal is to wean the insulin infusion and start long-acting insulin (Lantus) once the patient can take oral medications.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine level was 2.6 on admission and has improved to 1.5. This is likely due to severe volume depletion from persistently hyperglycemic states and possibly chronic renal insufficiency from untreated diabetes. IV fluids are being administered, and the patient should be started on ACE inhibitors once renal function stabilizes.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is high at 153. This is improving, but initially, it was 155"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of GERD and tobacco use. He presents with hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, and weight loss consistent with new onset diabetes and HHKS vs DKA. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypovolemia, acute renal failure (resolving), hyperkalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and GERD.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:

1. Hyperglycemia: If not properly managed, hyperglycemia can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). These conditions can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia. If not corrected, this can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially brain damage.

3. Hypovolemia: The patient's volume depletion can increase the risk of hypotension and shock. It is essential to restore fluid balance to prevent these complications.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's resolving acute renal failure requires close monitoring of kidney function. If not managed appropriately, it may progress to chronic renal failure.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is now better oriented to place and time but on occasion will
   have tangential thought. He believes his polyuria has resolved and
   admits to being less thirsty. He denies issues with his breathing.
   Hehas been transitioned from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin over
   the past 24 hrs.

   Agree with plan to advance PO intake and liberalize fluids too. In the
   interim we will replete free water deficit intravenously. [**Last Name (un) 303**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of GERD, tobacco use, and newly diagnosed diabetes presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has been treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy. His current condition shows improvement, with resolution of hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and hypophosphatemia. The patient's mental status has also improved, and he is expected to be discharged to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia/Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels and metabolic acidosis. Prompt treatment with insulin and fluid resuscitation was necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient had elevated creatinine levels on admission, indicating kidney dysfunction. This could be attributed to severe volume depletion due to persistently high blood glucose levels and possibly some element of chronic renal insufficiency from untreated diabetes. Close monitoring of kidney function and management of blood glucose levels are crucial to prevent further renal damage.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient had high sodium levels, indicating dehydration. Aggressive correction of hypernatremia should be done cautiously to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome. Frequent monitoring of electrolytes is required.
4. Mental Status Changes: The patient experienced mental fogginess, which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of GERD, tobacco use, and new-onset diabetes presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with closed anion gap on Lantus and sliding scale. The patient has hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, hypovolemia, acute kidney injury, and mental status changes.

The patient's initial assessment includes hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, hypovolemia, acute kidney injury, and mental status changes. The patient has been treated with aggressive fluids, both volume and free water repletion with 1/2NS and D5W. Insulin gtt has been stopped, and the patient is now on ISS, 7u fixed Humalog with meals and Lantus as per [**Last Name (un) 303**] recommendations.

The patient also has a history of GERD, tobacco use, and new-onset diabetes. The patient's lipid panel revealed LDL of 246, tChol in 300's on admission, and the patient was started on 40mg daily of atorvastatin. Lisinopril 5mg has been initiated for DM, and daily ASA will be started. The patient will need follow-up with [**Last Name (un) 303**] as an outpatient.

Acute kidney injury has resolved back to baseline of 1.1 this morning from Cr 2.6 on admission, baseline 1.1. The patient likely had severe volume depletion from persistently hyperglycemia and some element of chronic renal insufficiency from untreated diabetes. Lisinopril 5mg has been continued.

Hypernatremia has improved from 149 this AM D5 NS d/c'd yesterday after pt's sodium was normal yesterday. D51/2NS will be restarted at 125cc/hr, and Na will be checked q4hours. Electrolytes will continue to be trended q4hrs, and D5 NS will be restarted at 125cc/hr.

Mental status has improved from yesterday's report of a little foggy. However, there are still times when the patient seems to go into a tangent when asked complex questions. No other neuro deficits are noted. The patient's family stated he is back to baseline. Discussion will be held with the patient's family today regarding his mental status.

Hypophosphatemia is likely due to aggressive rehydration. Neutraphos 2pkts will be given, and trends will be continued.

GERD will be managed with continued home PPI. The patient will be on a diabetic diet, and electrolytes will be given as needed.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is likely D/c to the floor."

 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 HYPOVOLEMIA (VOLUME DEPLETION - WITHOUT SHOCK)
   56 year-old male w/ a history of GERD, tobacco use, new onset diabetes
   presenting in DKA with closed anion gap on Lantus and slitiding scale.
   # Hyperglycemia/Metabolic Acidosis: [**1-8**] new onset diabetes  Pt AG
   continues to be closed at 8 since yesterday following aggressive
   fluids, both volume and free water repletion with 1/2NS and D5W.  Pt
   has been off Insulin gtt since yesterday and is now on ISS, 7u fixed
   Humalog with meals and Lantus [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs.
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs, will continue ISS, fixed Humalog scale and
   Lantus
   - d/c foley once able to use bedside urinal
   - Lipid panel reveled LDL of 246, tChol in 300's on admission, pt was
   started on 40mg day
   - Will restart should be on ACE-I once renal function stabilizes
   - Wil start daily ASA
   - will need [**Last Name (un) 303**] follow up as outpatient
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolving abck to baseline of 1.1 this morning
   from Cr 2.6 on admission, baseline 1.1.  [**Last Name (un) **] was likely [**1-8**] to severe
   volume depletion from persistenly hyperglycemia.  Also likely has some
   element of chronic renal insufficeny from untreated diabetes.
   - will continue to trend
   # Hypernatremia:   146 this AM D5
 NS d/c
d yesterday. .  On
   admission, was 140 which corrected to 155 with elevated glucose.  Got
   4L NS in ED and hypernatremia [**1-8**] to large sodium dose from NS.
   - will continue to trend lytes
   #HypoPhos:  Likely [**1-8**] to aggressive rehydration
   - will give neutraphos
   - trend
   # GERD: Continue home PPI
   # FEN: IVF as above, lytes monitoring/repletion as above, NPO for now
   until mental status clears.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of GERD, tobacco use, and new onset diabetes presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with closed anion gap. The patient's current conditions include electrolyte and fluid disorder, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure.

The patient has been receiving aggressive fluid repletion with half-normal saline (1/2NS) and D5W, and insulin gtt has been discontinued. The patient is now on insulin subcutaneous (ISS) and Humalog with meals, along with Lantus as per the recommendations of [**Last Name (un) 303**].

The patient's labs show elevated glucose levels, high sodium levels, low potassium levels, low albumin, and elevated creatinine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 154/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is alert and oriented, with warm extremities and no acute distress.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing insulin therapy, monitoring electrolytes, and fluid repletion. The patient will also be started on aspirin and an ACE inhibitor once renal function stabilizes. The patient is expected to be discharged with follow-up as an outpatient.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Diabetic ketoacid"
