   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 60 y.o male with h.o hypereosinophilic syndrome on chemo
   (etoposide), DVT, CVA, afib, CHF EF (EF 30%), who presents with fever,
   cough, hypoxia and hypotension.
   1. Fever, cough, hypoxia
   Pt with known eosinophilic syndrome, immunosuppressed on chemotherapy.
   Recently admitted to the hospitalist service [**Date range (1) 11546**] with
   pulmonary and ID following. Started on voriconazole, azithro and
   cefepime. ABx except for vori were discontinued. He was ruled out for
   TB. The cause was thought to be fungal/parasitic/reoccurrence of
   hypereosinophilic syndrome. BAL was negative for growth at the time.
   Recently AFB was positive for non-TB. Etiologies for the above
   presentation include, CAP, viral respiratory pathogen such as
   influenza/paraflu, or other infection that occurs in the
   immunocompromised state such as fungal/MAC. Other things to be
   considered include CHF, PE or exacerbation of eosinophilic condition.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. 

The patient was recently admitted to the hospitalist service with pulmonary and infectious disease follow-up. He was started on voriconazole, azithromycin, and cefepime antibiotics, but all antibiotics except for voriconazole were discontinued. He was ruled out for tuberculosis (TB) and the cause of his symptoms was thought to be fungal/parasitic or a recurrence of hypereosinophilic syndrome. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative for growth at that time.

Recently, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was positive for non-TB. Etiologies for his presentation include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), viral respiratory pathogens such as influenza/parainfluenza, or other infections that occur in immunocompromised states such as fungal/Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Other considerations include CHF, pulmonary embolism (PE), or exacerbation of eosinophilic condition.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 60 y.o male with h.o hypereosinophilic syndrome on chemo
   (etoposide), DVT, CVA, afib, CHF EF (EF 30%), who presents with fever,
   cough, hypoxia and hypotension.
   1. Fever, cough, hypoxia
   Pt with known eosinophilic syndrome, immunosuppressed on chemotherapy.
   Also, recent h/o PNA, treated voriconazole, azithro and cefepime. ABx
   except for vori were discontinued. He was ruled out for TB. AFB was
   positive for non-TB. Also with penicillium species in culture.
   Etiologies for the above presentation include, CAP, viral respiratory
   pathogen such as influenza/paraflu, or other infection that occurs in
   the immunocompromised state. Other things to be considered include CHF,
   PE or exacerbation of eosinophilic condition.
   -- repeat sputum cx
   -- f/u other bcx/ucx, flu
   -- consider repeat bronch/bal
   -- broad spectrum abx for now given immunosuppression
           - cefepime for neutropenic fever
           - vanc given recent hospitalization
           - vori given penicillium growth
   -- hold on diuresis given concern for infection
   -- repeat echo to eval for changing EF
   -- f/u LENI to eval for DVT, though PNA more likely cause given CXR
   2. hypotension
   Pt with BP mid 80's at baseline per heme/onc fellow. Similar in the ED.
   Pt given 800cc fluid. Likely related to CHF (EF 30%) vs. possible
   infection/SIRS criteria.
   -- culture and treat for infection as above
   --f/u echo
   --hold on diuresis
   -- may require pressors to manage fluids given possible sepsis and EF
   30%
   3. hypereosinophilic syndrome-
   currently tx with etoposide Q2 weeks. Current presentation could be
   related to this syndrome.

   4. ARF-baseline 1-1.4.
   Improved to 1.3 with some IVF though UOP still low. Fe Urea 35% and not

   -- monitor UOP
   --renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   5. CHF-EF 30%. Currently with elevated trop and BNP.  Dry weight is 140
   lbs
   -- complete ROMI
   -- f/u ECHO
   -- strict Is and Os, daily weights
   6. blood per rectum-seen on toilet paper while on commode. Pt did not
   notice symptoms at home.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. The patient presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient's fever, cough, and hypoxia could indicate an infection such as CAP, especially given his immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy for leukemia.
2. Viral respiratory pathogen: Influenza or parainfluenza infection could also cause similar symptoms in an immunocompromised individual.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's CHF with a low ejection fraction may lead to fluid overload, resulting in hypoxia and hypotension.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of DVT, there is a possibility of a PE causing hypoxia and hypotension.
5. Eosinophilic condition exacerbation: The patient's hypereosinophilic syndrome could potentially worsen and contribute to his symptoms.
6. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can be caused by various factors including infection, hypoperfusion, or underlying kidney disease.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient had resolved hyperkalemia, which can occur in renal failure or due to medications.
8. Blood in stool: The patient's blood per rectum could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further investigation.
9. Stroke: The patient's history of CVA increases the risk of another stroke, although the current symptoms do not specifically suggest this complication.
10. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has stable afib, but it can contribute to decreased cardiac output and hypotension.
11. Leukemia: The patient's leukemia treatment may increase the risk of infection and other complications.
12. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is in the ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.

These are potential medical complications based on the provided information. It is important to note that a comprehensive evaluation by healthcare professionals is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (afib), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30% in 2009, and [**Last Name (un)**] syndrome. He presented to the emergency department with cough, yellow sputum, fever, hypotension, hypoxia, and generalized weakness. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of hypotension and fever in the setting of immunosuppression.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 81/58 mmHg to 73/45 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 61.7 kg.

The patient has received various medications including IV fluids, Kayexalate, heparin sodium, omeprazole, folate, vitamin D, bactrim, valgancyclovir, vancomycin, cefepime, prednisone, and voriconazole.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL with 86% eosinophils and 13% polys, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 67 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 115 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T level of 0.22. Other lab results are also provided.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, CHF, and acute renal failure (ARF). The plan includes careful fluid management, administration of antibiotics, repeat echo, and consideration of pressors if required.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of stroke, ischemic heart disease, leukemia, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with hypotension, hypoxemia, heart failure, fever, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care. His vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and oxygen saturation. However, he remains hypotensive and requires further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised due to acute renal failure. Frequent monitoring of kidney function and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte management are necessary.
3. Arrhythmias: The presence of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events. Continuous cardiac monitoring and anticoagulation therapy may be required.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic heart failure exacerbation needs careful management of fluid balance, oxygenation, and medication adjustments.
5. Leukemia Complications: Given the patient's leukemia history, there is a possibility of disease progression or complications such as infections or bleeding.
6. Stroke Risk: The patient's history of stroke increases the risk of another cerebrovascular event. Close neurological"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, cerebral vascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted to the ICU for cough with yellow sputum, fever, hypotension, hypoxia, and generalized weakness. He has been experiencing sepsis, with low blood pressures in the 80s-90s and tachycardia. He also has a cavitary lung nodule that was found on prior imaging and is now growing with AFB, non-MTB, and penicillium species. The patient has hypereosinophilic syndrome, acute presentation with dense consolidation on chest X-ray most consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He is being treated with prednisone, bactrim, and valgancyclovir prophylaxis. He also has CHF with a high B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level on admission, troponin T elevated but creatine kinase (CK) normal, indicating myocardial strain. His ejection fraction (EF) is 30% as of August 2009. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF) with creatinine levels up to 1.8 on admission, now improving with intravenous fluids (IVF). He has a prior CVA, and there is concern about increased fatigue and worsening underlying deficits."

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated overnight, requiring increased oxygen support. He is immunosuppressed due to chemotherapy and has tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Sputum cultures have grown Gram-positive cocci, Gram-positive rods, and Gram-negative rods, while urine leg is negative. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing increased oxygen requirements, which may be due to viral pneumonia caused by RSV. He is already on levo, cefepime, vancomycin, and voriconazole to cover bacterial and fungal pathogens. Additionally, there is a concern for exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with volume overload. Further follow-up with final sputum, blood, and urine cultures is recommended. Continuous administration of cefepime, vancomycin, and voriconazole is advised. Lasix 20mg IV once should be given to promote diuresis, aiming to remove negative 1L. A repeat echocardiogram should be performed to evaluate any changes in e"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, DVT, CVA, afib, and CHF. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has known eosinophilic syndrome and is immunosuppressed on chemotherapy. His respiratory viral screen was positive for RSV. He is currently on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications to cover bacterial and fungal pneumonia. There are concerns about CHF exacerbation with volume overload and possible PE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's immunosuppressed state, known eosinophilic syndrome, and positive RSV viral screen put him at risk for respiratory failure. Repeat sputum cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further evaluation for other bacterial or viral causes should be considered.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be related to CHF or infection/SIRS criteria. Cultures and treatment for infection should be continued, and further evaluation of CHF through echocardiogram and diuretic management is necessary.
3. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome: This chronic condition may contribute to the patient's current presentation. Hematology/oncology recommendations and possibly a bone marrow biopsy should be considered.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have worsened, indicating acute renal failure. Monitoring urine output and adjusting medications accordingly"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several health conditions that can potentially lead to complications. The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may result in organ damage or failure.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is at 90%, which is below the normal range. This indicates hypoxemia, which means there is insufficient oxygen reaching the tissues. It can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

3. Heart failure (CHF): The patient is experiencing both systolic and diastolic heart failure, which means the heart is not pumping effectively. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the body, causing edema and potentially life-threatening complications.

4. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, indicating an underlying infection. If not treated promptly, the infection can worsen and potentially spread to other parts of the body.

5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing an irregular heartbeat, specifically atrial fibrillation. This can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other cardiac complications.

6. Leukemia: The patient has acute leukemia, which is a type of cancer affecting the blood and bone marrow. Without appropriate treatment, leukemia can progress and lead to severe complications.

7. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, meaning the kidneys are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, DVT, CVA, AFib, and CHF. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and an exacerbation of congestive heart failure. He is currently receiving antibiotics and antiviral medication to cover for possible infections. The patient's blood culture is positive for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a bacterial infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and hypoxia suggest a possible pneumonia. The presence of diffuse ground glass opacities and patchy consolidations on the CT chest supports this diagnosis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and the presence of diffuse ground glass opacities on the CT chest may indicate the development of ARDS.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and positive blood culture suggest a potential sepsis.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) exacerbation: The patient's elevated BNP levels and evidence of volume overload on the physical examination indicate an exacerbation of CHF.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT increases the risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, DVT, CVA, afib, and CHF. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, renal failure, acute leukemia, and possible exacerbation of CHF with volume overload. The patient is immunosuppressed due to chemotherapy and has tested positive for RSV. Cultures have grown GPC, GPR, and GNR. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and platelets, as well as elevated levels of troponin T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxemia and respiratory failure indicate a high risk of further deterioration. The diffuse infectious infiltrates on the CT scan suggest a severe pulmonary infection, which may be caused by RSV or bacterial superinfection. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Sepsis: Given the presence of fever, hypotension, and positive cultures for bacteria and fungi, there is a significant risk of sepsis. The patient's immunosuppressed state increases the likelihood of severe infection. Aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and antifungal medications is crucial.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The patient has a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, cavitating lesion of lung, and recent admission for non-MTB and penicillium species growth in the FOB/BAL. The patient is currently experiencing fever, hypotension, and hypoxia, indicating septic shock. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with SpO2 at 90%.

The patient's cardiovascular system shows tachycardia, and the peripheral vascular examination reveals absent radial and digital pulses. The respiratory/chest examination indicates crackles and tachypnea. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.0 - 10.2 K/uL, decreased platelet count of 67 - 73 K/uL, elevated troponin-T level of 0.22 - 0.26 ng/mL, and elevated lactic acid level of 1.1 mmol/L. Blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci/gonorrhea. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and creatinine.

The patient's assessment includes sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, cavitary lung nodule, hypereosinophilic syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), and tachyc"

   all from RSV.  Possibly also with  bacterial superinfection, does not
   appear to have significant component of volume overload, though BNP
   elevated and pulm edema may also be contributing. No evidence of
   hemorrhage and dfa neg for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 11594**] also includes toxic effect from

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and a cavitary lung nodule. He was admitted with sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and progressive bilateral air space disease. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/62 to 78/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. He is alert but tachypneic with talking, has tachycardia, rales in the chest, warm and diaphoretic skin, and peripheral pulses present. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and elevated troponin T levels. Imaging reveals diffuse progressive bilateral air space disease likely due to RSV infection, with possible bacterial superinfection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and oxygen saturation is at 90%, indicating inadequate oxygenation. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory arrest if not managed appropriately.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels suggest systemic infection and sepsis. This condition can progress to septic shock if not treated promptly and"

   Imaging:
   ECHO
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
   inferior mild dyskinesis and more distal akinesis as well as akinesis
   of the distal lateral wall. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining
   segments (LVEF = 30%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The posterior leaflet
   is relatively fixed/immobile. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
   regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-8-30**], the left
   ventricular cavity is slightly smaller and the severity of mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic pressure are slightly
   reduced. Regional left ventricular systolic function is similar.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. The patient presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from their current condition:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: This is likely secondary to infection (RSV) and CHF exacerbation. The patient's respiratory status has improved with diuretics, but they are still experiencing hypoxemia. Monitoring and providing appropriate respiratory support will be crucial.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the mid-80s, which is below normal. This may be due to sepsis, heart failure, or other factors. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamics is necessary, and adjustments in fluid and medication management may be required.

3. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome: The patient is currently being treated with etoposide every two weeks. It is important to follow up with hematology/oncology recommendations for ongoing management of this condition.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Monitoring creatinine levels and continuing diuresis are recommended.

   Imaging:
   ECHO
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
   inferior mild dyskinesis and more distal akinesis as well as akinesis
   of the distal lateral wall. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining
   segments (LVEF = 30%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The posterior leaflet
   is relatively fixed/immobile. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
   regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-8-30**], the left
   ventricular cavity is slightly smaller and the severity of mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic pressure are slightly
   reduced. Regional left ventricular systolic function is similar.

","Summary:
- Patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, DVT, CVA, AFIB, CHF (ejection fraction 30%), who presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension.
- The patient is immunosuppressed due to chemotherapy and has respiratory failure secondary to infection (RSV) and CHF exacerbation.
- The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal treatment, and diuretics for volume overload.
- The patient has refused monoclonal antibody therapy for RSV.
- Potential complications include pneumonia, acute renal failure, heart failure exacerbation, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing infection (RSV) and CHF exacerbation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which may be secondary to poor forward flow. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
3. Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient has a history of CHF with reduced ejection fraction. His current symptoms and elevated BNP suggest worsening heart failure. Diuretics and strict fluid balance management are important in preventing exacerbation.
4. Hypotension: The patient has baseline hypotension in the mid-80s. Close monitoring of hemodynamics is necessary to prevent further hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia due to RSV infection. The patient's medical history includes chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, leukemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of stroke. The patient has been receiving various medications including valgancyclovir, bactrim, levofloxacin, voriconazole, and vancomycin.

Recent events include a trans-thoracic echo showing improved cardiac function and reduced severity of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic pressure. The patient received a second dose of lasix IV and is being considered for anti-RSV antibody treatment. The patient's allergies, last doses of antibiotics, and ongoing infusions are also documented.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. Fluid balance and respiratory support are being closely monitored. The patient is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery with a current SpO2 of 90%. ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis and hypoxemia.

Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessment, and other systems. Laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, hyponatremia, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Imaging, microbiology, and additional lab tests are pending.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
   inferior mild dyskinesis and more distal akinesis as well as akinesis
   of the distal lateral wall. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining
   segments (LVEF = 30%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The posterior leaflet
   is relatively fixed/immobile. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
   regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-8-30**], the left
   ventricular cavity is slightly smaller and the severity of mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic pressure are slightly
   reduced. Regional left ventricular systolic function is similar.

   cough, hypoxia and hypotension.
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Worsening and progressive hypoxemia and
   respiratory failure and diffuse infectious infiltrates. He is with
   known eosinophilic syndrome, immunosuppressed on chemotherapy. Resp
   viral screen positive for RSV, sputum has preliminarily grown GPC, GPR,
   and GNR, and urine leg neg.  DFA negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] currently,
   on levo, cefepime, vanc, and vori to cover bacterial and fungal pna
   (recently has grown penicillium species in culture).  Also, with
   elevated BNP element of CHF exacerbation w/ volume overload.  PE also
   on the differential, though less likely given viral findings as above.
   Primary problem is sepsis from pulmonary infection likely RSV with
   possible bacterial superinfection, do not suspect cardiogenic shock.
   - Resend sputum
   - F/u sputum, blood and urine cx
   - Cont cefepime/vanc/vori/levofloxacin
   - Lasix 40 iv x1, goal diuresis negative 1L
   - Consider further diuresis if pt improves after diuresis
   - Repeat echo to eval for changing EF
   - Consider IV antibody paviluzameb as last resort effort
   - Incentive spirometry, guiafenesin, tesslon pearls to clear mucous,
   - Appreciate hem/onc input
   - Place picc line for better access/iv abx
   2. Hypotension: Baseline in mid 80s, currently sbp in low 100s.  Will
   continue to follow given concern for SIRS/CHF.  Cortisol wnl.
   - While diuresing neg 1L will need to monitor hemodynamics
   - Consider pressors if develops worse hypotension and would avoid more
   fluids
   - Consider placing central line or evaluating w/ US to obtain CVP if
   hypotension worsens

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure (EF 30%). He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient is currently on chemotherapy, which makes him immunosuppressed. Respiratory viral screen is positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and sputum has grown Gram-positive cocci, Gram-positive rods, and Gram-negative rods. DFA negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Worsening and progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure with diffuse infectious infiltrates. The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to RSV infection and possible bacterial superinfection. Elevated BNP indicates an element of congestive heart failure exacerbation with volume overload. Pulmonary embolism is also on the differential, though less likely given viral findings. The primary problem is sepsis from pulmonary infection likely caused by RSV with possible bacterial superinfection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, DVT, CVA, AFib, and CHF. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has improved with diuretics but remains hypoxic and hypotensive. He is immunosuppressed due to chemotherapy. The respiratory viral screen is positive for RSV, and the sputum culture shows growth of GPC, GPR, and GNR. The patient has refused monoclonal antibody therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to infection (RSV) and CHF exacerbation.
2. Hypotension: The patient has baseline hypotension in the mid-80s, which may be related to his underlying conditions or medication side effects.
3. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome: The patient is currently being treated with etoposide every two weeks for his hypereosinophilic syndrome.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which can be secondary to poor forward flow.
5. CHF Exacerbation: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 30%. It is likely contributing to the current respiratory failure with an element of volume overload.
6. Blood in Stool: The patient has blood per rectum seen on toilet paper while on the commode. Further evaluation is needed.
7. s/p CVA: The patient's CT head is negative for any ischemic or hemorrhagic events.
8. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib is stable.
9. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which can be secondary to hypoxia or infection.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 30%). The patient presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is severely compromised, requiring supplemental oxygen. The underlying causes include progressive infection (RSV) and an exacerbation of congestive heart failure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, which is likely secondary to the RSV infection. Antibiotics and antiviral medications have been prescribed to treat the infection.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. This could be due to volume overload, urinary tract infection, or other factors. Diuretics have been used to manage fluid balance and prevent further deterioration.

4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's pre-existing congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 30%) has been exacerbated by the current illness. Diuretics have been administered to reduce fluid overload.

   cough, hypoxia and hypotension.
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Worse today, likely primarily secondary
   to progressive infection (RSV). CHF exacerbation another cocontributor
   but less likely.  Continues to require supplemental oxygen despite
   diuresis and antibiotics for superimposed infection. Resp viral screen
   positive for RSV, sputum has preliminarily grown GPC, GPR, and GNR, and
   urine leg neg.  DFA negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] currently, cefepime,

   granular casts/cellular casts and possible UTI. No flank pain and
   afebrile to suggest pyelo.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - Judicious diuresis, goal will be -500cc
   - Hold ace-i
   5. CHF-EF 30%. Secondary to eosinophilic syndrome. On admission,
   patient w/ some evidence of volume overload now s/p diuresis with some
   improvement in shortness of breath, though CXR continues to show
   diffuse infiltrates and patient remains with oxygen requirement.  Have
   contact[**Name (NI) **] outpatient cardiologist who agrees w/ diuresis and holding
   anti-hypertensives for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, DVT, CVA, AFIB, and CHF (ejection fraction of 30%). He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient is currently on chemotherapy for his eosinophilic syndrome and is immunosuppressed. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure secondary to infection (RSV) and CHF exacerbation. He is also experiencing leukocytosis, hypotension, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of infection (RSV) and CHF exacerbation. He requires supplemental oxygen and may require mechanical ventilation if his condition worsens.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated WBC count, indicating a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of leukocytosis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to his underlying conditions such as CHF or sepsis. Close monitoring of hemodynamics is necessary.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal failure. The cause could be related to his CHF or potential UTI. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting diuretic therapy accordingly is important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of vision changes. The patient has a medical history of heart failure (systolic and diastolic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypereosinophilia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium, furosemide, omeprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 75/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a face tent.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated troponin T levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low hemoglobin (Hgb), low potassium (K+), and low sodium (Na+). The patient's kidney function tests indicate elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, but the use of a face tent for supplemental oxygen suggests possible respiratory distress or difficulty breathing.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, and chronic heart failure (ejection fraction 30%). He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient is currently receiving chemotherapy for his eosinophilic syndrome, making him immunosuppressed.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Secondary to infection (RSV) and CHF exacerbation. Improving with diuresis and antibiotics for superimposed infection. The patient has refused monoclonal antibody therapy.

2. Hypotension: Baseline in mid 80s. Continuation of monitoring hemodynamics, blood pressures appear to be stable at his baseline.

3. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome: Currently being treated with etoposide every two weeks. Follow-up with hematology/oncology recommendations.

4. Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine levels are elevated. Can be secondary to poor forward flow. Monitoring creatinine and continuation of diuresis.

5. CHF: EF 30%. Secondary to eosinophilic syndrome. Currently with elevated troponin and BNP. Likely contributing to current respiratory failure with element of volume overload. Dry weight is 140 lbs. Ruled out for myocardial infarction with three stable cardiac enzymes. Strict intake"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and increased oxygen requirement suggest worsening respiratory failure. The presence of diffuse infiltrates on the chest X-ray and positive RSV screen indicate a viral respiratory infection, which may be contributing to the respiratory failure.

2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. The symptoms of shortness of breath and volume overload, along with the findings of moderate mitral regurgitation and significant pulmonic regurgitation on the echocardiogram, suggest an exacerbation of CHF.

3. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine levels from 1.2 to 1.8, along with the presence of granular and cellular casts in the urine, indicate acute renal failure. This could be due to prerenal causes, intrinsic renal disease, or postrenal obstruction.

4. Leukemia: The patient has a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome and is currently being treated with etoposide. Leukocytosis with an elevated WBC count, along with pyuria/bacturia, suggests the possibility of leukemia.

5. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure in the mid-80s indicates chronic hypotension, which may be related to his CHF or other underlying conditions.

6. Fever: The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotics suggests an ongoing infection or other underlying cause.

7. Mood/Nutrition: The patient's poor oral intake and mood changes, including frustration and giving up, may indicate the need for psychiatric evaluation and intervention.

These are some of the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient based on the provided progress note. It is important to monitor and manage these conditions appropriately to ensure the patient's well-being."

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension.

The patient is currently being treated for respiratory failure secondary to infection (RSV) and CHF exacerbation. He requires supplemental oxygen and has shown some improvement in shortness of breath after diuresis and antibiotics. New leukocytosis was noted today.

The patient has an eosinophilic syndrome and is immunosuppressed on chemotherapy. He tested positive for RSV, and his sputum culture showed growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-positive rods (GPR), and gram-negative rods (GNR). A DFA test was negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii). He is currently receiving cefepime, vancomycin, and voriconazole to cover bacterial and fungal pneumonia. He refused monoclonal antibody therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen despite diuresis and antibiotics for superimposed infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.4, but it has increased to 1.8. There is concern for acute renal failure due to diuretic use.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%. There are diffuse infiltrates on the chest X-ray indicating fluid overload, and the patient remains dependent on supplemental oxygen.
4. Leukemia: The patient has a history of leukemia (ALL, AML, cancer, malignant neoplasm) and is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

   pulm edema is unlikely to be contibuting.
   --Continue supportive care with cough suppression, nebs
   --consider NPPV if fatigues
   --will hold on additional diuresis, ? component of preload dependence
   with decline related to volume depletion
   --continue broad empiric antbx to compelte 14 day course
   --I suspect a new superinfection is unlikely, however, given
   immunosuppression and now mild leukocytosis -- will repeat nosocomial
   infection workup and add empiric double GNR coverage
   #CHF
BNP elevated and initial concern for cardiogenic edema.  He has
   been diuresed and at this time does not appear volume overloaded, neck
   veins are flat,  cxr w/o evidence of pulm edema/effusion, labs s/o
   overdiuresis and his PO intake is minimal
   --will hold on additional lasix  at this time
   # ARF: BUN and cr increasing, suspect from diuresis,
   will hold lasix, monitor UOP, check urine sediment  and renally dose

   # Cavitary lung nodule: s/p FOB with BAL and biopsy, now growing, AFB,
   ----non-MTB, and penicillium species, final probe pending.
   --continue voriconazole

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. The patient remains hypoxic despite diuresis and requires increased FiO2. The chest X-ray shows diffuse alveolar damage, suggesting a possible case of pneumonitis caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), with a potential bacterial superinfection. The patient is being supported with cough suppression, nebulizers, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) if necessary. Broad empiric antibiotics will be continued for a complete 14-day course, and a repeat nosocomial infection workup with double Gram-negative bacterial coverage will be added.

2. There is a concern for congestive heart failure (CHF), but at this time, it does not appear to be volume overloaded as the neck veins are flat and the chest X-ray does not show evidence of pulmonary edema. The labs suggest overdiuresis, so diuretic therapy will be held for now.

3. The patient has tachycardia, which is likely driven by respiratory distress/failure. Diuretic therapy will be followed up to address this issue.

4. The patient is experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), with creatinine levels increasing. This is suspected to be caused by diuresis and poor renal perfusion. Lasix will be held, and the patient will be monitored closely. The ARF may improve with diuresis.

   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Continues to remain short of breath and
   tachypneic, now also with confusion which could also be contributed by
   hypoxemia.  Underlying process primarily secondary to progressive
   infection (RSV). CHF exacerbation on admission, but now appears
   dehydrated.  Continues to require supplemental oxygen despite diuresis
   and antibiotics for superimposed infection. Resp viral screen positive
   for RSV, sputum has preliminarily grown GPC, GPR, and GNR, and urine
   leg neg.  DFA negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] currently, cefepime, vanc, and
   vori to cover bacterial and fungal pna (recently has grown penicillium
   species in culture).  He has refused monoclonal antibody.  Cont to
   consider PE, though less likely. Increasing white count [**2-21**] worsening
   eosinophilia, however, possible resistant UTI, follow up cultures.
   - Add levoflox
   - Check vanc trough
   - Cont vanc, cefepime ([**3-5**] for 14 day course) and vori (fungal infxn)
   - Consider modifying tx for eosinophilic syndrome although risky given
   active infection. Nonetheless, pt is not going to clear his infection
   with 97% eosinophils
   - F/u sputum, blood, CMV and urine cx
   - Consider adding a second antibiotic [**Doctor Last Name **] for double gram negative
   coverage esp give UTI and hypotension
   - Hold on Lasix, as pt hypotensive and satting better
   - Patient has refused IV antibody paviluzameb
   - Incentive spirometry, guiafenesin, tesslon pearls to clear mucous

   patient w/ some evidence of volume overload now s/p diuresis with some
   improvement in shortness of breath, though CXR continues to show
   diffuse infiltrates and patient remains with oxygen requirement.  Have
   contact[**Name (NI) **] outpatient cardiologist who agrees w/ diuresis and holding
   anti-hypertensives for now.
   - strict Is and Os, daily weights
   - Continue holding ace-i/bb given low bps as well as ARF for ace-i

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, and leukemia. The patient presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). He also has leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient's current medications include cefepime, vancomycin, voriconazole, heparin sodium, omeprazole, and mirtazapine. His recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count with worsening eosinophilia, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's recent imaging studies include a chest X-ray showing diffuse infiltrates without evidence of kinking or tip displacement of the PICC line, and a CT head negative for ischemic or hemorrhagic events.

The patient's ongoing assessments and plans include hypoxemia, respiratory alkalosis, viral pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypotension, CHF exacerbation, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, confusion (delirium), hypoalbuminemia, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.

   cough, hypoxia and hypotension.
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Worse today, likely primarily secondary
   to progressive infection (RSV). CHF exacerbation another cocontributor
   but less likely.  Continues to require supplemental oxygen despite
   diuresis and antibiotics for superimposed infection. Resp viral screen
   positive for RSV, sputum has preliminarily grown GPC, GPR, and GNR, and
   urine leg neg.  DFA negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] currently, cefepime,
   vanc, and vori to cover bacterial and fungal pna (recently has grown

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of leukemia, currently admitted to the ICU. He has been experiencing hypoxemia, respiratory alkalosis, pneumonia (RSV), hyponatremia, acute renal failure, hypotension, heart failure (acute on chronic), fever, and leukemoid reaction. The patient's leukocytosis has increased, and cultures have been sent for blood, urine, sputum, and stool. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory support and fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxemia and need for oxygen supplementation indicate a risk of respiratory complications. Pneumonia, specifically RSV, has already been identified, which can further compromise respiratory function.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and history of chronic heart failure suggest a potential risk for cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
3. Renal Complications: Acute renal failure is present, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection-related Complications: The patient's fever and positive gram-positive cocci on sputum gram stain suggest a possible bacterial infection. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
5. Hematological Complications: The patient's leukemoid reaction indicates a potential risk for hematological complications related to his underlying leukemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, DVT, CVA, atrial fibrillation, and CHF. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to progressive infection (RSV), CHF exacerbation, and possible resistant urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently on antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, and voriconazole), but his condition has not improved. The patient also has leukocytosis with worsening eosinophilia and renal failure. Other concerns include delirium, hypoNa, hypotension, hypereosinophilic syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure could worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection may progress, leading to sepsis and septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, potentially requiring dialysis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's pre-existing CHF may worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.

         FTT/poor nutritional status
         Cavitary lung nodule ([**Doctor First Name **], penicillium)
         Hypereosinophilic syndrome
   Remains hypoxic, no improvement after diuresis and now with progressive
   ARF.  Clinically with slow decline.  Suspect his chronic
   hypereosinophilia is further complicating his picture, but in setting
   of underlying infection we are very limited in terms of treatment
   options.  We continue supportive care with cough suppression, nebs,
   morphine for air hunger, broad empiric antbx.  Will follow VBG and
   consider NPPV if pt will tolerate in setting of fatigue.
   Suspect the increased leukocytosis is from his eosinophilia, but will
   pursue infection eval (repeat ua/cx, c diff) and add levo for double GN
   coverage. He has remained AF, BP low from his low baseline.
   His ARF is most likely pre-renal from diuresis and poor PO. Bactrim
   could be contributing. He appears dry on exam. We continue to hold
   lasix and will give slow IVF, following uop and urine lytes.  Will
   renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   In terms of delirium-this is likely multifactorial-- sundowning, poor
   sleep, uremia, hypoxemia, poor PO, hyponatremia. He is now clear after
   haldol.  Will optimize sleep wake as possible, use haldol or zydis,
   slow IVF bolus.
   His hyponatremia is most likely hypovolemic and we will monitor with
   hydration.
   He remains on vori for his lung cavitary lesion, prednisone for HES.
   His prognosis is poor and he seems tired.  We will continue to work
   with oncology and address pt desired GOC, have discussed palliative
   option and will readdress this.  Nutrition remains problem[**Name (NI) 555**].  [**Name2 (NI) **]
   pursue swallow eval pending GOC discussion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, chronic atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and a lung cavitary lesion. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia due to a severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by presumed bacterial superinfection, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory failure (ARF), hyponatremia, poor nutritional status, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive ARF: The patient is experiencing a slow decline in clinical status, and there is suspicion of worsening ARF.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains hypoxic despite supportive care, which indicates ongoing respiratory failure.
3. Presumed Bacterial Superinfection: The patient may have a bacterial infection on top of the RSV infection, requiring appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient exhibits rales on lung auscultation and has evidence of fluid overload, suggesting pulmonary edema.
5. Chronic Hypereosinophilia: The patient's underlying hypereosinophilic syndrome could further complicate his clinical picture.
6. Poor Nutritional Status: The patient is malnourished, which can impede recovery and increase the risk of complications.
7. Cavitary Lung Nodule: The patient has a cavitary lung lesion caused by"

         Hypereosinophilic syndrome
   Remains hypoxic, no improvement after diuresis and now with progressive
   ARF.  Clinically with slow decline.  Suspect his chronic
   hypereosinophilia is further complicating his picture, but in setting
   of underlying infection we are very limited in terms of treatment
   options.  We continue supportive care with cough suppression, nebs,
   morphine for air hunger, broad empiric antbx.  Will follow VBG and
   consider NPPV if pt will tolerate in setting of fatigue.
   Suspect the increased leukocytosis is from his eosinophilia, but will
   pursue infection eval (repeat ua/cx, c diff) and add levo for double GN
   coverage. He has remained AF, BP low from his low baseline.
   His ARF is most likely pre-renal from diuresis and poor PO. Bactrim
   could be contributing. He appears dry on exam. We continue to hold
   lasix and will give slow IVF, following uop and urine lytes.  Will
   renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   In terms of delirium-this is likely multifactorial-- sundowning, poor
   sleep, uremia, hypoxemia, poor PO, hyponatremia. He is now clear after
   haldol.  Will optimize sleep wake as possible, use haldol or zydis,
   slow IVF bolus.
   His hyponatremia is most likely hypovolemic and we will monitor with
   hydration.
   He remains on vori for his lung cavitary lesion, prednisone for HES.
   His prognosis is poor and he seems tired.  We will continue to work
   with oncology and address pt desired GOC, have discussed palliative
   option and will readdress this.  Nutrition remains problem[**Name (NI) 555**].  [**Name2 (NI) **]
   pursue swallow eval pending GOC discussion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome, recent admission for a cavitating lesion in the lung, and current infection with RSV. He has been experiencing respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and sepsis. The patient's condition is critical, and he remains hypoxic despite oxygen therapy. He also has acute renal failure (ARF), hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and poor nutritional status. The patient's prognosis is poor, and he has expressed his desire to transition to aggressive comfort measures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a high risk of respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.

2. Sepsis: The presence of sepsis increases the risk of organ dysfunction and failure, including ARF, which the patient already has.

3. ARF: The patient's ARF is likely pre-renal due to diuresis and poor oral intake. It is essential to monitor urine output and electrolytes closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.

4. Delirium: The patient's confusion and agitation could be attributed to multiple factors such as sundowning, poor sleep, uremia, hypoxemia, poor oral intake, and hyponatremia. Optimizing sleep-wake cycle, using antipsychotic medications, and ensuring adequate hydration are important in"

         Cavitary lung nodule ([**Doctor First Name **], penicillium)
         Hypereosinophilic syndrome
   Remains hypoxic, no improvement after diuresis and now with progressive
   ARF.  Clinically with slow decline.  Suspect his chronic
   hypereosinophilia is further complicating his picture, but in setting
   of underlying infection we are very limited in terms of treatment
   options.  We continue supportive care with cough suppression, nebs,
   morphine for air hunger, broad empiric antbx.  Will follow VBG and
   consider NPPV if pt will tolerate in setting of fatigue.
   Suspect the increased leukocytosis is from his eosinophilia, but will
   pursue infection eval (repeat ua/cx, c diff) and add levo for double GN
   coverage. He has remained AF, BP low from his low baseline.
   His ARF is most likely pre-renal from diuresis and poor PO. Bactrim
   could be contributing. He appears dry on exam. We continue to hold
   lasix and will give slow IVF, following uop and urine lytes.  Will
   renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   In terms of delirium-this is likely multifactorial-- sundowning, poor
   sleep, uremia, hypoxemia, poor PO, hyponatremia. He is now clear after
   haldol.  Will optimize sleep wake as possible, use haldol or zydis,
   slow IVF bolus.
   His hyponatremia is most likely hypovolemic and we will monitor with
   hydration.
   He remains on vori for his lung cavitary lesion, prednisone for HES.
   His prognosis is poor and he seems tired.  We will continue to work
   with oncology and address pt desired GOC, have discussed palliative
   option and will readdress this.  Nutrition remains problem[**Name (NI) 555**].  [**Name2 (NI) **]
   pursue swallow eval pending GOC discussion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic resp failure
 Pneumonitis from RSV, bacterial superinfection,
   Remains hypoxic, no improvement with diuresis and now inprogressive
   ARF.
   CXR appears unchanged with diffuse ASD/no effusions. At this time feel
   cardiogenic pulm edema is unlikely to be contibuting.
   Clinically declining.  Suspect his chronic hypereosinophilia is further
   complicating this but in setting of underlying infection we are very
   limited in terms of treatment options at this time.
   --Continue supportive care with cough suppression, nebs
   --Consider NPPV if fatigues
   --holding on diuresis (ARF and  minimal PO)
   --continue broad empiric antbx to compelte 14 day course and will add
   double GNR coverage given u/a and concern for additional
   superinfection.
   --Morphine for air hunger
   --Check VBG
   # CHF
BNP elevated and initial concern for cardiogenic edema.  He has
   been diuresed and at this time does not appear volume overloaded, neck
   veins are flat,  cxr w/o evidence of pulm edema/effusion, labs s/o
   overdiuresis and his PO intake is minimal
   --will hold on additional lasix  at this time
   # delirium-multiple reasons
sundowning, uremia, hypxemia, poor PO
   Will optimzie sleep wake, use haldol, gentle hydration for hyponatremia
    # hyponatremia
suspect all from hypovolemia/poor PO
   # ARF: BUN and cr increasing, suspect from diuresis,
   will hold lasix, monitor UOP, check urine sediment  and renally dose
   meds
   # Cavitary lung nodule: s/p FOB with BAL and biopsy, now growing, AFB,
   ----non-MTB, and penicillium species, final probe pending.
   --continue voriconazole
   # Hypereosinophilic syndrome:
   -continue prednisone and bactrim prophylaxis
   -defer further treatment to onc pending clinical improvement from acute
   resp issues
   # depression and goals of care
SW following, will initiate joint
   meeting with onc team to assess pt desired goals, consider starting
   mirtazapine
   #nutritonal status
Poor PO intake, nutrition input, ensure when MS
   allows
