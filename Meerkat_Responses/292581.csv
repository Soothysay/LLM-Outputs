","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, presenting with symptoms of abdominal pain. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected complications of a bile leak. The patient underwent open cholecystectomy and subsequently developed a bile leak at the operative site. An ERCP procedure was performed, which demonstrated the bile leak and a stent was placed in the common bile duct. The patient's incision site shows signs of induration and erythema, and there is a concern for purulence.

The patient's current condition includes septic shock, respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ETOH abuse, acute renal failure, anemia, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, colitis, and hyperlipidemia. His vital signs are stable, but he requires mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygenation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and lipase/amylase levels. Imaging studies reveal small bilateral pleural effusions and right middle lobe atelectasis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to the presence of a bile leak and potential abscess formation. The induration and erythema around the incision site may indicate an infection at the surgical site.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and requires mechanical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol (ETOH) and cocaine abuse, who presented with gangrenous cholecystitis and perforated gallbladder. He underwent an open cholecystectomy and was transferred to another hospital for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to a suspected bile leak. The patient has been on unclear antibiotics and has developed septic shock with an elevated white blood cell count. He also has respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the patient has acute on chronic systolic heart failure with a reported ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. He is also diagnosed with ETOH abuse, acute renal failure, anemia, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and colitis. The patient's current condition is stable, but his medical complications require close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bile leak with associated abscess formation.
2. Infection and sepsis due to the presence of infection markers such as elevated white blood cell count and mildly elevated temperatures.
3. Respiratory failure requiring ongoing mechanical ventilation support.
4. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with reduced EF.
5. Acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels.
6. Anemia of chronic disease.
7. Leukocytosis and possible infectious workup.
8. Hypernatremia secondary to hypovolemic hy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected bile leak. He underwent surgical management, including open cholecystectomy and ERCP with CBD stent placement for the bile leak. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bile leak at operative site: The patient had a bile leak after the open cholecystectomy, which was managed with ERCP and CBD stent placement. The ongoing monitoring of the Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain is important to assess if there is any ongoing bile leakage.
2. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained from blood, sputum, and biliary drains, and they are pending. The presence of alpha-strep from operative cultures may indicate a bacterial infection.
3. Hypotension/Septic shock: The patient experienced transient lower blood pressures overnight, which responded to a 500cc bolus. The infection is thought to be the biliary source. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued administration of antibiotics are important.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially on pressure support ventilation but has been weaned to spontaneous breaths with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. He is currently on a synchronized intermittent mandatory breath (SIMV)"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ETOH and cocaine abuse per report, CHF with EF 15%, now
   transferred from OSH s/p surgical management for gangrenous and
   perforated gall bladder with suspected complication of bile leak,
   transferred for ERCP.
   # Gangrenous cholecystitis s/p open cholecystectomy complicated by bile
   leak: POD 3 from surgery on [**3-7**].  Intraoperative findings of perforated
   gallbladder with associated abscess.  Has been on unclear antibiotics
   at OSH (verbal report imipenem/vanomycin/flagyl on transfer).  Alpha
   strep from operative cultures, blood cultures negative to date.
   Incision site with some lateral induration and erythema and
   ?purulence.  ERCP performed on [**3-9**] demonstrated a bile leak at
   operative site and stent placed in CBD. Afterwards, JP drainage slowed
   considerably to 70cc over past 12 hours. Random Vanc level on admission
   was 20.1. Lipase/Amylase elevated post-procedure.
   - Surgery consult this AM
   - F/U GI recs
   - Monitor JP drainage.
   - F/U culture data
   - Continue Vancomycin/Cefepime/Flagyl for now, day 4
   - CT abd/pelvis post ERCP to eval surgical site and drainage
   - Trend Lipase/Amylase in AM to ensure downtrending
   # Septic Shock: Normotensive without pressors, but infection thought to
   be biliary source. Lactate 0.7. WBC at 23.1, mildly elevated
   temperatures this AM.
   - Can also check ScvO2 if BPs drop again.
   - Blood, urine, sputum, biliary cultures pending
   - C. diff ordered
   - Re-check CXR this AM
   - f/u OSH cultures
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl for now, day 4
   # Respiratory Failure:  Unclear on circumstances under which intubated
   ?from post OR.  On CPAP, requiring 22/10 and FiO2 0.5 to maintain
   oxygenation. ETT tube placement appropriate (4cm from carina). On
   Fentanyl/Versed for sedation. CXR on admission demonstrated small
   bilateral pleural effusions and right middle lobe atelactasis. Sputum
   gram stain negative this AM, but cultures pending.
   - Check TTE
   - Decrease pressure support & re-evaluate
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Per report, EF 15%, but no
   OMR records. Patient without pacemaker. Etiology unclear, EtOH vs.
   cocaine vs. ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy as his ingestion history is
   synergistic for development of cardiomyopathy.  LBBB pattern on ECG
   present at OSH admission with negative CEs, but age unknown.  Appears
   euvolemic on exam.
   - Holding home Carvedilol given BP
   - Holding home Torsemide given ARF, consider restarting if BP
   tolerate
   - Holding home ACE given ARF & BP
   - Likely diuresis once blood pressure tolerates
   - Gentle IVF
s when necessary
   - Encourage EtOH cessation
   - Outpatient cardiology follow-up for evaluation for pacemaker
   # ETOH Abuse:  Per report, but unknown history. Not folate/b12
   deficient.
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal once off sedation.
   - Continue IV folate/thiamine
   - Continue IV MVI until can tolerate PO
   - SW consult when patient weaned from sedation
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline, but Cr 0.8 this AM down from
   1.1 on presentation. Likely prerenal as improve with 1L D5W yesterday.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ETOH and cocaine abuse, presenting with gangrenous cholecystitis and a perforated gallbladder. He underwent open cholecystectomy and ERCP, which revealed a bile leak at the operative site. The patient has been on unclear antibiotics, and a stent was placed in the CBD. There are concerns about septic shock, respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ETOH abuse, acute renal failure, anemia, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, colitis, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's current condition includes being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a recent improvement in sodium levels after receiving IV fluids. There are multiple ongoing assessments and plans for further evaluation and treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is an intubated individual with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. They have undergone several medical interventions, including surgery consultation, GI recommendation for fluids and CT scan, administration of D5W due to elevated sodium levels, and ERCP for biliary leak. The patient's condition has shown some improvement with decreased WBC count and improved sodium levels. However, there are still concerns regarding persistent fluid and fat stranding in the gallbladder fossa, minimal stranding in the pancreatic tail, and degenerative changes in the spine. The patient also has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and LV dilatation consistent with ethanol dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for various infections due to their intubation, use of central lines, and prolonged hospital stay. These infections can include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), or catheter-related urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

2. Cardiac issues: The patient's low EF and LV dilatation indicate compromised heart function, which increases the risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Pancreatitis: The slightly increased lipase levels suggest ongoing pancreatic inflammation. If left untreated or worsened, this could lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.

4. Biliary leak"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, currently admitted to the ICU for surgical management of gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected complication of bile leak. The patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and subsequently developed a bile leak, which was managed with ERCP and CBD stent placement. The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, likely due to alcohol abuse. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and has respiratory failure. He is also experiencing hypotension and possible sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, colitis, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bile leak with associated infection and sepsis.
2. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
3. Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Acute renal failure.
5. Anemia of chronic inflammation.
6. Leukocytosis with potential for infection.
7. Hypernatremia.
8. Colitis.
9. Hyperlipidemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an ICU admitted male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient has undergone several interventions, including surgery consultation, GI recommendation for fluids and CT scan, administration of D5W to address elevated sodium levels, and ERCP to investigate biliary leak. The patient's labs show improved sodium levels, decreasing WBC count, and slightly increased lipase. CT abdomen/pelvis reveals persistent fluid and fat stranding around the gallbladder fossa, indicating an extraluminal biliary leak seen during ERCP. There is also minimal stranding around the pancreatic tail, possibly related to uncomplicated pancreatitis. Degenerative changes in the spine were noted. TTE showed EF 15-20%, LV dilatation consistent with EtOH DCM. The patient was trialed on [**5-11**], but hypercarbic, so turned up to [**8-11**] overnight and placed on SBT since 6 AM. The patient has no known drug allergies and received various antibiotics over the course of the day. Infusions include midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C, blood pressure ranging from 81/40 mmHg to 123/70 mmHg, heart rate between 77-105 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, and recent surgical management for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected bile leak. He was transferred from another hospital for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to a bile leak at the operative site. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension/possible sepsis, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ethanol abuse, acute renal failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, colitis, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and weaning difficulties due to acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient experienced transient lower blood pressures overnight, possibly secondary to diuresis. There is a concern for sepsis from a biliary source, as indicated by elevated white blood cell count and fever.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. His cardiac function may deteriorate further due to ongoing inflammation, sepsis, or complications from surgery.
4. Ethanol Abuse: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent surgery and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure in the 80s/40s and a recent spike in temperature to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain medication, and prophylactic heparin. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney function. The patient has multiple medical problems, including colitis, anemia, acute renal failure, hyperlipidemia, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, chronic heart failure, cholecystitis, alcohol abuse, respiratory failure, sepsis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's condition appears to be deteriorating, with worsening fluid balance, respiratory support, and organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's abnormal renal function tests, along with the presence of fluid overload and oliguria, indicate potential acute kidney injury. This condition can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and may require dialysis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, and cocaine use. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for surgical management of gangrenous and perforated gall bladder with suspected bile leak. The patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and ERCP & CBD stent placement on [**3-9**] for the bile leak at the operative site. He also has acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, colitis, and hyperlipidemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/possible sepsis: The patient experienced transient lower blood pressures overnight, which were likely secondary to diuresis. Infection is suspected to be from a biliary source. The white blood cell (WBC) count has decreased from 20.8 to 15.7, but no positive culture data is available.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He was weaned off pressure support yesterday but had to be increased due to hypercarbia. The patient has small bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a severely reduced EF of 15-20% with left vent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ETOH and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure, and a low ejection fraction of 15%. He presented with gangrenous and perforated gallbladder, which required surgical management. He developed a bile leak at the operative site, and an ERCP with CBD stent placement was performed. The patient also has respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ETOH abuse, acute renal failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, colitis, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count may indicate a potential infection, possibly from the biliary source. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is essential.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been weaned off pressure support but still requires mechanical ventilation. Daily weaning trials should continue while monitoring for any signs of deterioration.

3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is significantly reduced at 15%, indicating severe heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary.

4. ETOH Withdrawal: Since the patient has a history of ETOH abuse, it is crucial to monitor for signs of withdrawal once sedation is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, and recent surgical management for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected bile leak. The patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and was found to have a perforated gallbladder with an abscess. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and common bile duct (CBD) stent placement were performed on POD 6 for the bile leak at the operative site.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension/possible sepsis, respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ethanol abuse, acute renal failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, leukocytosis, colitis, and hyperlipidemia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/?Sepsis: The patient is normotensive without the need for pressors on lasix gtt. The infection is thought to be a biliary source. The WBC count has decreased from 28.8 on admission to 14.4, but there are no positive culture data. Blood cultures are pending, as well as sputum, NG, and biliary cultures.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5, rate (f) of 16, and tidal volume (VT) of 0.500. Sedation is being decreased to allow for daily weaning trials.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's echocardiogram (TTE) shows an EF of 15-20% with left ventricular (LV) dilatation. The cardiologist believes that this imaging is consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) due to ethanol abuse. The patient also has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern on electrocardiogram (ECG) with negative CEs, but the age of onset is unknown.
4. Ethanol Abuse: The patient reportedly has a history of ethanol abuse, but the details are unknown. He is not folate or vitamin B12 deficient. It is important to monitor for signs of withdrawal once the patient is weaned off sedation. The patient should continue receiving intravenous folate/thiamine and multivitamins until he can tolerate oral intake. A social worker consultation is recommended when the patient is weaned from sedation.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline renal function is unknown, but the current creatinine level is 0.8 (1.1 on presentation). The BUN/Cr ratio should be trended.

   FINDINGS: A single semi-upright radiograph of the chest was obtained
   and compared to prior exam dated [**2174-3-10**]. Endotracheal tube, left
   subclavian catheter and nasogastric tubes are again seen and unchanged
   in
   position. The tip of the nasogastric tube is not visualized on the
   film.
   There is stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There is stable
   bilateral interstitial prominence which may represent pulmonary edema
   and
   additional areas of linear atelectasis are seen bilaterally. Overall,
   there
   is no appreciable change from the prior exam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cocaine use, presenting with gangrenous cholecystitis status post open cholecystectomy and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for surgical management and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition includes hypotension/sepsis, respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, acute renal failure (resolved), ETOH abuse, colitis, hyperlipidemia, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible infection. The source of infection could be biliary, as suggested by the history of bile leak. Monitoring of the joint pain (JP) drain and consultation with surgery for possible drain removal and Dobhoff placement are recommended.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory system compliance is reduced. Close monitoring of the respiratory status and consideration for tracheostomy placement may be necessary.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and left ventricular dilatation. Cardiac rehabilitation, diuretics, and consideration for a pacemaker may be required.
4. Anemia of Chronic Disease: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, but further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, who presented with gangrenous cholecystitis status post open cholecystectomy and respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for surgical management and is now being evaluated for complications such as bile leak, hypotension/sepsis, respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, leukocytosis, ETOH abuse, acute renal failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, colitis, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bile leak: The patient had a perforated gallbladder with abscess during surgery, and an ERCP & CBD stent placement was done for bile leak at the operative site. There is stranding at the site of the procedure on CT abdomen/pelvis, but no fluid collection. All cultures are negative to date except for alpha strep from operative cultures.
2. Hypotension/Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and infection is suspected as the cause. Biliary source is considered the most likely source of infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and the RSBI is 100. The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 18/5, and sedation is being decreased.
4. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's e"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, and recent surgical management for gangrenous and perforated gall bladder with suspected bile leak. The patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and was found to have a perforated gallbladder with abscess. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and common bile duct (CBD) stent placement were performed on [**3-9**] to address the bile leak at the operative site. The patient's current condition includes hypotension/sepsis, respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ETOH abuse, acute renal failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, leukocytosis, colitis, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, diuretics, and cardiac medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding potential complications such as sepsis, respiratory distress, heart failure exacerbation, and renal dysfunction. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, lipase, and amylase levels. Imaging reveals bilateral interstitial prominence and stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Microbiology cultures are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, and recent surgical management for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected complication of bile leak. The patient has undergone an open cholecystectomy, intraoperative findings of perforated gallbladder with abscess, and placement of an ERCP and CBD stent for bile leak at the operative site. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis shows only stranding at the site of the procedure and pancreatitis, but no fluid collection. Lipase/amylase levels are elevated post-procedure but trending down. All cultures are negative except for alpha strep from operative cultures. WBC count is trending down, currently at 14.4.

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension/possible sepsis, respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ethanol abuse, acute renal failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, leukocytosis, colitis, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, sedation, and nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis indicate a possible infection. The source of infection is suspected to be biliary. Blood, sputum, and biliary cultures are pending"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis with organ dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, hyperlipidemia, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, alcohol abuse, cholecystitis, and colitis.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been stable with fluctuations in vital signs. His temperature is within normal range, but his blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from 86/60 mmHg to 112/74 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has been consistently elevated, ranging from 93-121 bpm. His respiratory rate has been within normal limits, and oxygen saturation has been maintained at 94%.

Fluid balance has been relatively even, with a total intake of 2,299 mL and output of 2,515 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 77.1 kg at admission to 75.2 kg currently.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests indicate borderline high creatinine levels. Liver function tests are within normal range. Electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits, except for slightly elevated potassium levels. Imaging shows worsening cardiac decompensation with pulmonary vascular engorgement and abnormal heart size."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol and cocaine abuse, presenting with chronic heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. The patient underwent surgical management for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected complication of bile leak. He was transferred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and CBD stent placement. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, leukocytosis, anemia of chronic inflammation, colitis, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and a low respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 88. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to underlying chronic heart failure and potential lung complications.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart function is severely compromised with an EF of 15%. The combination of chronic heart failure and acute stressors may exacerbate cardiac decompensation, leading to worsening hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response. This could be due to the biliary source or other sources of infection, which need to be identified and treated"

He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy placed. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The chest X-ray shows persistent airspace opacity in the right lung base, which could represent underlying pneumonia. The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest a possible infection. The source of infection could be the surgical site, pneumonia, central venous line infection, or pancreatitis. 
2. Pneumonia: The chest X-ray findings and the patient's symptoms of fever and tach"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall, 75.2 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of 24-hour events. The patient underwent a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday and did well but felt further diuresis would be better prior to extubation. Lasix gtt was restarted and the patient diuresed well. The patient also switched to PO Haldol for agitation to enable turning down IV sedation. The patient developed a fever of 103F at 4:30 PM and was started on Zosyn in addition to Flagyl and Cipro. There were no increased secretions or signs of infection on chest X-ray. The patient experienced periods of apnea and tachypnea, so an ABG was performed. The results showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 55, and PaO2 96, suggesting possible [**Last Name (un)**]-[**Doctor Last Name**] breathing or heart failure. The patient had a run of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and received 40 mg of K. The patient's blood pressure dropped into the low 70s, so the lasix gtt was discontinued. The decision was made to start low-dose pressors over fluid boluses, and the patient is currently on levophed at 0.08 mcg/kg/min.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, and recent surgical management for gangrenous and perforated gall bladder with suspected bile leak. The patient underwent open cholecystectomy and was found to have a perforated gall bladder with abscess. An ERCP and CBD stent placement were performed for the bile leak at the operative site. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, leukocytosis, anemia of chronic inflammation, colitis, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. The source of infection could be biliary, pneumonia, or a line infection. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and Zosyn) and cultures are pending.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is concern about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the persistence of airspace opacity on chest X-ray. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 240, indicating moderate hypoxemia.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a severely reduced ejection fraction (EF 15-20%) with left ventricular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cocaine use. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis, and abdominal pain. He underwent an open cholecystectomy due to gangrenous cholecystitis and developed a bile leak. An ERCP and CBD stent placement were performed, but he continues to have fluid collections in the abdomen and evidence of ongoing infection. He is currently on multiple antibiotics and is being treated for C. difficile. His vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires pressor support. His respiratory status is improving, but he still requires ventilatory support. He also has acute on chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, possibly from a gallbladder source given recent surgery. There is a concern for recurrent bile leak, and surgery recommends intraoperative drainage. Other possible sources of infection include the lungs and pancreatitis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be prolonged due to sepsis. Increasing FiO2 and PEEP has helped improve oxygenation. Further evaluation is needed for potential infectious processes.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. His current"

   61M with ETOH and cocaine abuse per report, CHF with EF 15%, now
   transferred from OSH s/p surgical management for gangrenous and
   perforated gall bladder with suspected complication of bile leak,
   transferred for ERCP, now with hypoxia, hypotension requiring pressor
   support
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Started on levophed on [**3-16**] given SBPs in the
   70s, attempts to wean unsuccessful. Most likely source is gallbladder
   given recent surgery.  CT results suggest possible recurrent bile
   leak.  Surgery recommends IR drainage. Other possible surce of
   infection could be pulmonary given neew hypoxia and increased net
   requirements, but sputum gram stain negative and CTA yesterday did not
   demonstrate any focal process.  Pancreatitis also a concern given
   recent ERCP, and lipase persistently elevated, but stable since
   procedure.  Also with diarrhea yesterday, C. Diff sent.  Leukocytosis
   stable.  Lasix off since yesterday. UOP has been wnl.
   - IR consult for possible drainage of fluid collection.
   - Blood pending, sputum cx pending, C. Diff toxin pending
   - Continue vanc/cipro/flagyl/zosyn.
   - D/c tube feeds and trend lipase
   - monitoring via arterial line
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   # Gangrenous cholecystitis s/p open cholecystectomy complicated by bile
   leak, now with fluid collection on CT: POD 9, Intraoperative findings
   of perforated gallbladder with abscess.  S/p ERCP & CBD stent placement
   on [**3-9**] for bile leak at operative site. CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrates
   only stranding at site of procedure and pancreatitis, but no fluid
   collection. All cultures negative to date except alpha strep from
   operative cultures. WBC was trending down, today slightly elevated from
   11.9
 14.8.  Patient spiked temp to 103F (?PNA vs biliary source vs
   line infection; NMS or felt to be less likely). On Ciprofloxacin day 4,
   Flagyl, day 5, Zosyn day 2.  On [**2174-3-14**], vanco and cefepime were
   discontinued after 7 days.  Vanco restarted [**2174-3-16**], day 2.
   - F/U GI & Surgery recs
   - Monitor JP drainage
   - F/U culture data, blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Continue vanc/cipro/flagyl/zosyn
   - Trend WBC
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Increased FiO2 and PEEP yesterday.  Also
   increased sedation.  CTA did not show any infectious process, sputum
   gram stain negative, cultures pending.  Unable to diurese 2/2 blood

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, and recent surgical management for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected complication of bile leak. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypoxia, hypotension requiring pressor support, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/63 mmHg to 74/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 608 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals sclera anicteric, PERRL, and MMM. The neck is supple, and there are distant heart sounds with a 2-12 holosystolic murmur. Bowel sounds are present, and there is a decrease in abdominal distention. The right upper quadrant (RUQ) shows tenderness and a drain with minimal clear"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent cholecystectomy and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes and hypoxia despite being on mechanical ventilation. There were no signs of superficial infection or purulent material during the exploration of the surgical wound. An attempt to aspirate deeper under the surgical wound was unsuccessful. Fluid collections near the surgical site could not be drained due to their small size. The patient has a history of emphysema and a 2-mm pulmonary nodule, which should be re-evaluated in 12 months. Imaging shows no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but there are bilateral small pleural effusions and atelectasis in the lung bases. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 99.5°F (37.5°C), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 93/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever spikes and hypoxia could be indicative of an underlying infection leading to sepsis. The inability to drain fluid collections and the presence of elevated white blood cell count support"

   recent surgery.  CT results suggest more organized fluid collections in
   gall bladder fossa.  Surgery recommended IR drainage but they are
   unable d/t small size of collection. Other infectious etiologies
   considered are pulmonary (sputum NG, CXR and CTA without e/o
   infection),  pancreatitis given recent ERCP and Lipase of 200, cdiff
   given diarrhea (negative x 2), line infection but no blood cltxs with

   cultures). Increased FiO2 and PEEP [**3-16**], also increased sedation.  CTA
   did not show any infectious process, sputum gram stain negative,
   cultures pending.  Unable to diurese 2/2 blood pressure.
   - Sepsis now likely to prolong vent course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure, and recent open cholecystectomy for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected bile leak. He was admitted for hypoxia and hypotension requiring pressor support. The patient continues to spike fevers with no clear source of infection. He has been started on levophed due to SBPs in the 70s, and attempts to wean have been unsuccessful. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Fever: The patient's hypotension and fever may be due to a gallbladder infection or complication from the recent surgery. Organized fluid collections in the gallbladder fossa were seen on CT, and surgery recommended IR drainage but was unable to due to the small size of the collection.
2. Gangrenous Cholecystitis: The patient had an open cholecystectomy complicated by a bile leak, which resulted in fluid collection on CT. There is a possibility of infection or abscess formation.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be caused by decreased respiratory drive, worsening COPD or atelectasis, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia. Increased FiO2 and PEEP have been adjusted, and increased sedation has been administered.
4. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an e"

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is bile leak and septic shock. The patient was weaned off levophed around 5 PM and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a rate of 12/12 as of 4 PM. The random cortisol level is 14.3 (within normal range), and there is consideration for initiating steroids to hopefully accelerate weaning off levophed.

The patient developed trunkal macular erythematous rash around 10 PM, which appeared to be a drug rash. The medication zosyn was discontinued, and meropenem was started (the patient has known drug allergy with cephalosporins).

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ETOH and cocaine abuse and CHF (EF 15%), transferred from OSH
   s/p open CCY for gangrenous and perforated gall bladder with suspected
   complication of bile leak s/p ERCP and stenting. Admitted for hypoxia
   and hypotension requiring pressor support. Continues to spike fevers
   with no clear source of infection.
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Started on levophed on [**3-16**] given SBPs in the 70s,
   attempts to wean unsuccessful. Most likely source is gallbladder given
   recent surgery.  CT results suggest more organized fluid collections in
   gall bladder fossa.  Surgery recommended IR drainage but they are
   unable d/t small size of collection. Other infectious etiologies
   considered are pulmonary (sputum NG, CXR and CTA without e/o
   infection),  pancreatitis given recent ERCP and Lipase of 200, cdiff
   given diarrhea (negative x 2), line infection but no blood cltxs with
   NG since [**3-9**], wound infection (no e/o of infection despite
   exploration).  Leukocytosis has resolved with WBC of 10 today.  Lasix
   off since [**3-16**]. UOP has been wnl but decreased overnight slightly to 50
   ccs per hour.  Other causes of fever considered include pulmonary

   acute change seen on CXR), PNA (no e/o PNA on imaging or sputum
   cultures). Increased FiO2 and PEEP [**3-16**], also increased sedation.  CTA
   did not show any infectious process, sputum gram stain negative,
   cultures pending.  Unable to diurese 2/2 blood pressure.
   - Sepsis now likely to prolong vent course.
   - Most likely, increased sedative requirement is contributing to
   decreased respiratory drive and hypoxemia. However, may be prudent to
   rule out CNS source with head CT  and LP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cocaine use, who presented to the ICU with hypoxia and hypotension requiring pressor support. He has undergone open cholecystectomy for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected bile leak. The patient has been experiencing fevers and has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem. His blood cultures are pending. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/58 mmHg to 112/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, distant heart sounds with a holosystolic murmur, and stable abdominal distention. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal renal function tests. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, and there is a concern for sepsis secondary to the suspected gallbladder infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggest a possible ongoing infection, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ETOH and cocaine abuse and CHF (EF 15%), transferred from OSH
   s/p open CCY for gangrenous and perforated gall bladder with suspected
   complication of bile leak s/p ERCP and stenting. Admitted for hypoxia
   and hypotension requiring pressor support. Continues to spike fevers
   with no clear source of infection.
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Started on levophed on [**3-16**] given SBPs in the 70s,
   successfully weaned off [**3-18**] afternoon. Most likely source is
   gallbladder given recent surgery.  CT results suggest more organized
   fluid collections in gall bladder fossa.  Surgery recommended IR
   drainage but they are unable d/t small size of collection. Other
   infectious etiologies considered are pulmonary (sputum NG, CXR and CTA
   without e/o infection),  pancreatitis given recent ERCP and Lipase of
   200, cdiff given diarrhea (negative x 2), line infection but no blood
   cltxs with NG since [**3-9**], wound infection (no e/o of infection despite
   exploration).  Leukocytosis has resolved with WBC of 10 today.  Lasix
   off since [**3-16**]. UOP has been wnl but decreased overnight slightly to 50
   ccs per hour.  Other causes of fever considered include pulmonary
   embolism (CTA negative), atelectasis, medications (off cephalosporins
   since [**3-14**]). Given new rash, pt may have also had drug reaction to
   Zosyn.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Continue vanc/cipro/flagyl. Zosyn changed to meropenem on [**3-18**].
   - Continue tube feeds but trend lipase
   - monitoring via arterial line
   .
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Possible etiologies include: decreased
   respiratory drive (sedatives, CNS infection, CNS infarct), worsening
   COPD or atelectasis, pulmonary edema (although diuresed well and no
   acute change seen on CXR), PNA (no e/o PNA on imaging or sputum
   cultures). Have been attempting to wean sedation, pt now on PSV 12/12.
   CTA did not show any infectious process, sputum gram stain negative,
   cultures pending.  Unable to diurese 2/2 blood pressure.
   - Sepsis now likely to prolong vent course.
   - Most likely, increased sedative requirement was contributing to
   decreased respiratory drive and hypoxemia earlier.  Patient doing well
   on PSV since yesterday, so will defer ruling out CNS source with head
   CT and LP for now.
   .
   # Anemia: Patient noted to have a HCT drop of ~7 points since yesterday
   from 34
 27.4 (MCV 92). Prior iron studies support anemia of chronic
   disease; since admission, patient
s HCT has been stable in low 30s.  No
   evidence of bleeding. Surgical wound without drainage or e/o bleed. Pt
   HD stable o/n.
   -Will check LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin.  Given rash and recent Zosyn
   administration, most likely secondary to drug effect, although this is
   usually seen after prolonged therapy courses.
   -Trend HCT now off Zosyn
   -Guaiac stool
   .
   # Gangrenous cholecystitis s/p open cholecystectomy complicated by bile
   leak, now with fluid collection on CT: POD 10, Intraoperative findings
   of perforated gallbladder with abscess.  S/p ERCP & CBD stent placement
   on [**3-9**] for bile leak at operative site. CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrates
   only stranding at site of procedure and pancreatitis, but no fluid
   collection. All cultures negative to date except alpha strep from
   operative cultures. WBC 10.0 today. On Ciprofloxacin day 4, Flagyl, day
   5, Meropenem day 1 (d/cd Zosyn after 2 days on [**3-18**]).  On [**2174-3-14**], vanco
   and cefepime were discontinued after 7 days.  Vanco restarted [**2174-3-16**],
   day 2.
   - F/U GI & Surgery recs
   - Monitor JP drainage
   - F/U culture data, blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Continue vanc/cipro/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - Trend WBC
   .
   #Rash: maculopapular trunkal rash noted on evening of [**3-18**] after 48
   hours administration of Zosyn.  Thought to be drug allergy response.
   D/cd Zosyn with some resolution of rash this morning. Will monitor
   patient now on Meropenem.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Per TTE [**3-10**], EF 15-20% with
   LV dilatation. Cardiologist felt imaging was consistent with a DCM from
   EtOH.  LBBB pattern on ECG present at OSH admission with negative CEs,
   but age unknown.  Goal is to diurese and restart BB, but blood pressure
   has been low.
   - try restarting Carvedilol once BP stable, restarting bb should
   potentially increase filling time and CO
   - holding home Torsemide given ARF and then lasix gtt.
   - Holding home ACE given BP
   - Outpatient cardiology follow-up for evaluation for pacemaker

   # Colitis: Etiology unknown. Diarrhea again last night, if persists,
   may consider restarting his home asacol.
   - Hold asacol for now.

","The patient's chief complaint is bile leak and septic shock. The patient has a history of ethanol and cocaine abuse and congestive heart failure (EF 15%), and was transferred from another hospital after undergoing an open cholecystectomy for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with a suspected complication of bile leak. 

The patient has been admitted for hypoxia and hypotension requiring pressor support. The assessment and plan indicate that the most likely source of infection is the gallbladder given recent surgery, with a CT scan showing organized fluid collections in the gallbladder fossa. Other infectious etiologies considered include pulmonary, pancreatitis, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and line infection. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and meropenem, with changes made based on culture results and drug reactions.

The patient also has respiratory failure, possibly due to decreased respiratory drive, worsening COPD or atelectasis, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has shown improvement.

Additionally, the patient has anemia, with a HCT drop of approximately 7 points since yesterday from 34% to 27.4%. This could be due to drug effect or an underlying condition. 

The patient has gangrenous cholecystitis with a bile leak and fluid collection on CT, which was managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo with EtOH abuse, Cocaine abuse and admitted with bile leak and
   now s/p stent who not has had continued fevers in the setting of
   treatment for known sources of sepsis.  He has had continued empiric
   antibiotics for possible sources but have failed to define clear source
   in terms of cultures but intra-abdominal source is clearly original
   source
   1)SEPSIS-Levophed weaned to off and able to complete wean over past 24
   hours.  Will have to continue to monitor cultures.
   -Cipro/Flagyl/Vanco
   -Source appears to be intra-abdominal insult given bile leak and open
   CCY conducted with gangrenous gallbladder.
   -We have now reasonable course of Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl continuing
   -Will follow culture results
   -If results negative and fever controlled and down to normal WBC count
   and given rash and increased EOS may have to move to trail off of
   antibiotics if surgical team/GI team comfortable and fever presists.
   2)RENAL FAILURE-Improved Cr at this time
   3)RESPIRATORY FAILURE
Patient with persistent hypoxemia seen in this
   setting with PO2=58 and significant aniong gap noted.  We have had PEEP
   up at relatively elevated levels but at this time abdomen is soft and
   hope to be able to wean.
   -Will wean PEEP to 8 today and re-evaluate tolerance as we do have
   persistent hypoxia
   -We do have a background of liver disease but not to the extent that
   would be classic for hepato-pulmonary syndrome
   -Will need to continue to lighten sedation and allow patient to wake up
   -Will start amitryptalline/scopalamine to aid with oral secretions
   -Continue with PSV today
   -For hypoxia
COPD,  Atelectasis, possible intra/extrapulmonary shunt
   but not clearly defined
   -Will follow wean with ABG
s today and hope to maintain stable
   ventilation on PSV=5 and will hope to eliminate oral secretions and be
   left with management of hypoxia as primary barrier to extubation  as we
   move through the next 24 hours.
   4)Anemia
Source not clear, will follow HCT and consider possible GI
   losses
   -HCT q 8 hours today
   -Transfuse for continued trend down
   -Will need to evalaute.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of EtOH and cocaine abuse, who was admitted with a bile leak and subsequently underwent stent placement. He has been experiencing fevers despite treatment for known sources of sepsis. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, anemia, and possible complications such as COPD, atelectasis, intra/extrapulmonary shunt, and hepato-pulmonary syndrome. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers despite empiric antibiotic therapy, suggesting an ongoing infection. The source of infection is unclear, but an intra-abdominal source related to the bile leak and previous surgery is suspected. Monitoring cultures and continuing appropriate antibiotics are recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and shows persistent hypoxemia. PEEP will be weaned to 8 today to evaluate tolerance. Sedation will be lightened, and the patient will be encouraged to wake up. Amitriptyline/scopolamine will be used to manage oral secretions. PSV will continue, and ABG monitoring will be done to maintain stable ventilation and ultimately facilitate extubation.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved. Continued monitoring of renal function is necessary.

4. Anemia: The cause of anemia is unclear, but possible GI losses should be evaluated. HCT will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ETOH and cocaine abuse and CHF (EF 15%), transferred from OSH
   s/p open CCY for gangrenous and perforated gall bladder with suspected
   complication of bile leak s/p ERCP and stenting. Admitted for hypoxia
   and hypotension requiring pressor support. Continues to spike fevers
   with no clear source of infection.
   .
   # Hypotension/Recurrent Fevers: Now off levophed, still with daily
   fever.  Most likely infectious source is biliary, but fluid collections
   too small to drain.  No organisms have ever been isolated from many
   cultures/sites.  Also there is some question of whether he is spiking a
   fever due to drug side effect.  Meropenem stopped yesterday [**2-8**] ? drug
   rash.  His leukocytosis has resolved and has no localizing signs.  We
   will d/c antibiotics today.  If fevers are a drug effect, the fevers
   should stop, if it is infectious, then the infection should present
   itself definitively in the absence of antibiotics.
   - d/c all antibiotics
   - follow cultures
   - follow fever curve
   - Continue tube feeds but trend lipase
   - monitoring via arterial line
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Possible etiologies include: decreased
   respiratory drive (sedatives, CNS infection, CNS infarct), worsening
   COPD or atelectasis, pulmonary edema (although diuresed well and no
   acute change seen on CXR), PNA (no e/o PNA on imaging or sputum
   cultures). Significant progress on weaning ventilator support.
   Challenging as he does not responds well to weaning sedation.  We will
   trial an SBT today, as it appears that his septic/infectious issues are
   improving.
   -          SBT today
   # Anemia: Hct stable today.  Iron studies c/w iron deficiency.
   -Trend HCT
   -Guaiac stool
   .
   # Gangrenous cholecystitis s/p open cholecystectomy complicated by bile
   leak, now with fluid collection on CT: POD 11.  Fluid collections of
   unclear significance.
   - stop anitbiotics
   - Monitor JP drainage
   - F/U culture data, blood and urine cultures
   - Trend WBC
   .
   #Rash: maculopapular trunkal rash noted on evening of [**3-18**] after 48
   hours administration of Zosyn.  Thought to be drug allergy response.
   D/c
d Zosyn with some resolution of rash this morning. Will monitor
   patient now on Meropenem.
   -          stop antibiotics
   -          monitor clinically
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Per TTE [**3-10**], EF 15-20% with
   LV dilatation. Cardiologist felt imaging was consistent with a DCM from
   EtOH.  LBBB pattern on ECG present at OSH admission with negative CEs,
   but age unknown.  Goal is to diurese and restart BB, but blood pressure
   has been low.
   - restart Carvedilol once BP stable
   - holding home Torsemide given ARF and then lasix gtt.
   - Holding home ACE given BP
   - Outpatient cardiology follow-up for evaluation for pacemaker
   .
   # Colitis: Etiology unknown. Diarrhea again last night, if persists,
   may consider restarting his home asacol.
   - Hold asacol for now.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding home Gemfibrizol given acute hepatic/biliary
   process.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure (ejection fraction 15%), and recent open cholecystectomy for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected bile leak. The patient was admitted for hypoxia and hypotension requiring pressor support. He continues to spike fevers with no clear source of infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Recurrent Fevers: The patient is currently off levophed and still experiencing daily fevers. The most likely infectious source is biliary, but fluid collections are too small to drain. No organisms have been isolated from cultures/sites. There is some question whether the patient is spiking a fever due to drug side effect or an infection. If the fevers are due to a drug effect, they should stop after discontinuing antibiotics. If infectious, the infection should present itself definitively without antibiotics.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Possible etiologies include decreased respiratory drive, worsening COPD or atelectasis, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or CNS infection/infarct. The patient has made progress in weaning ventilator support but does not respond well to weaning sedation. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted today as it appears that the patient's septic/infectious issues are improving.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ETOH and cocaine abuse and CHF (EF 15%), transferred from OSH
   s/p open CCY for gangrenous and perforated gall bladder with suspected
   complication of bile leak s/p ERCP and stenting. Admitted for hypoxia
   and hypotension requiring pressor support. Continues to spike fevers
   with no clear source of infection.
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Started on levophed on [**3-16**] given SBPs in the 70s,
   successfully weaned off [**3-18**] afternoon. Most likely source is
   gallbladder given recent surgery.  CT results suggest more organized
   fluid collections in gall bladder fossa.  Surgery recommended IR
   drainage but they are unable d/t small size of collection. Other
   infectious etiologies considered are pulmonary (sputum NG, CXR and CTA
   without e/o infection),  pancreatitis given recent ERCP and Lipase of
   200, cdiff given diarrhea (negative x 2), line infection but no blood
   cltxs with NG since [**3-9**], wound infection (no e/o of infection despite
   exploration).  Leukocytosis has resolved with WBC of 10 today.  Lasix
   off since [**3-16**]. UOP has been wnl but decreased overnight slightly to 50
   ccs per hour.  Other causes of fever considered include pulmonary
   embolism (CTA negative), atelectasis, medications (off cephalosporins
   since [**3-14**]). Given new rash, pt may have also had drug reaction to
   Zosyn.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Continue vanc/cipro/flagyl. Zosyn changed to meropenem on [**3-18**].
   - Continue tube feeds but trend lipase
   - monitoring via arterial line
   .
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Possible etiologies include: decreased
   respiratory drive (sedatives, CNS infection, CNS infarct), worsening
   COPD or atelectasis, pulmonary edema (although diuresed well and no
   acute change seen on CXR), PNA (no e/o PNA on imaging or sputum
   cultures). Have been attempting to wean sedation, pt now on PSV 12/12.
   CTA did not show any infectious process, sputum gram stain negative,
   cultures pending.  Unable to diurese 2/2 blood pressure.
   - Sepsis now likely to prolong vent course.
   - Most likely, increased sedative requirement was contributing to
   decreased respiratory drive and hypoxemia earlier.  Patient doing well
   on PSV since yesterday, so will defer ruling out CNS source with head
   CT and LP for now.
   # Anemia: Patient noted to have a HCT drop of ~7 points since yesterday
   from 34
 27.4 (MCV 92). Prior iron studies support anemia of chronic
   disease; since admission, patient
s HCT has been stable in low 30s.  No
   evidence of bleeding. Surgical wound without drainage or e/o bleed. Pt
   HD stable o/n.
   -Will check LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin.  Given rash and recent Zosyn
   administration, most likely secondary to drug effect, although this is
   usually seen after prolonged therapy courses.
   -Trend HCT now off Zosyn
   -Guaiac stool
   .
   # Gangrenous cholecystitis s/p open cholecystectomy complicated by bile
   leak, now with fluid collection on CT: POD 10, Intraoperative findings
   of perforated gallbladder with abscess.  S/p ERCP & CBD stent placement
   on [**3-9**] for bile leak at operative site. CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrates
   only stranding at site of procedure and pancreatitis, but no fluid
   collection. All cultures negative to date except alpha strep from
   operative cultures. WBC 10.0 today. On Ciprofloxacin day 4, Flagyl, day
   5, Meropenem day 1 (d/cd Zosyn after 2 days on [**3-18**]).  On [**2174-3-14**], vanco
   and cefepime were discontinued after 7 days.  Vanco restarted [**2174-3-16**],
   day 2.
   - F/U GI & Surgery recs
   - Monitor JP drainage
   - F/U culture data, blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Continue vanc/cipro/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - Trend WBC
   .
   #Rash: maculopapular trunkal rash noted on evening of [**3-18**] after 48
   hours administration of Zosyn.  Thought to be drug allergy response.
   D/cd Zosyn with some resolution of rash this morning. Will monitor
   patient now on Meropenem.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Per TTE [**3-10**], EF 15-20% with
   LV dilatation. Cardiologist felt imaging was consistent with a DCM from
   EtOH.  LBBB pattern on ECG present at OSH admission with negative CEs,
   but age unknown.  Goal is to diurese and restart BB, but blood pressure
   has been low.
   - try restarting Carvedilol once BP stable, restarting bb should
   potentially increase filling time and CO
   - holding home Torsemide given ARF and then lasix gtt.
   - Holding home ACE given BP
   - Outpatient cardiology follow-up for evaluation for pacemaker
   .
   # Colitis: Etiology unknown. Diarrhea again last night, if persists,
   may consider restarting his home asacol.
   - Hold asacol for now.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding home Gemfibrizol given acute hepatic/biliary
   process.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure (EF 15%), and recent open cholecystectomy for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder. The patient was admitted for hypoxia and hypotension requiring pressor support. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension/fever, hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia, gangrenous cholecystitis s/p open cholecystectomy complicated by bile leak, colitis, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypotension/fever (possible sepsis), further deterioration of respiratory function leading to respiratory failure, development of acute kidney injury due to hypotension and potential medication effects, worsening of heart failure symptoms, and potential development of hepatic complications due to previous biliary processes.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional tests, imaging, and clinical findings may be necessary to confirm these assessments and identify any other potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with initial admission with bile leak following open CCY and
   now with persistent sepsis and respiratory failure.
   1)Sepsis--clearly with significant insult with intra-abdominal process
   and now has had fever persisting but overall trending down, he has had
   WBC count decreasing and culture results.  Wound exploration completed,
   alternative sources not clearly seen, CVL has been in place
   throughout.  After careful discussion with surgical team have concluded
   on the fact patient is clinically improved patient will have D/C of
   antibiotics after 14 day course
   -Cipro/Vanco/Flagyl to D/C today
   -Will have to pursue restart of broad spectrum antibiotics and pursue
   further imaging for alternative sites of drainage should clinical
   response decline.  Will puruse drainage of fluid collections of
   technically possible or clinical worsening seen.
   -Levophed remains off
   -Follow culture results
   -Drainage to continue
   2)Respiratory Failure-Patient with initial intubation for surgical
   intervention and with persistent intubation in the setting of resolving
   sepsis.  At this point barriers to extubation may be
   A)Altered Mental Status
   B)Congestive Heart Failure
patient without pulmonary edema noted on
   CXR
do not have evidence of total body overload or pulmonary edema
   C)Secreations
better with scopalamine patch at this time
   D)Abdominal Process
Improved exam today and resolved process
   -We have persistent and significant tachypnea with PSV of 5 at 26
   breaths per minute.  We do have ABG with
normal
 CO2 but I would
   suggest that with RR at 26 patient is at the limit in terms of
   respiratory effort and drive to maintain even a reasonable CO2 and this
   is not favorable for successful extubation.  Will need to continue to
   support more fully with
   -Versed 3 and Fentayl IV as needed this morning.
   3)EtOH Abuse-
   -Thiamine to continue
   Additional issues to be addressed as discussed in the housestaff note
   of this date.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with an initial admission for a bile leak following open CCY and now with persistent sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.2 C (99 F), BP: 86/45 (58) mmHg, HR: 80 bpm, RR: 31 insp/min, SpO2: 97%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, and EtOH abuse. The sepsis is due to a significant insult with an intra-abdominal process, and the patient has had a fever persisting but overall trending down. The wound exploration completed, and alternative sources are not clearly seen. The CVL has been in place throughout. After careful discussion with the surgical team, it has been concluded that the patient is clinically improved, and the antibiotics will be discontinued after a 14-day course.

The respiratory failure is due to persistent intubation in the setting of resolving sepsis. At this point, barriers to extubation may be altered mental status, congestive heart failure (patient without pulmonary edema noted on CXR), secretions (better with scopalamine patch at this time), or an abdominal process (improved exam today and resolved process).

   s/p open CCY for gangrenous and perforated gall bladder with suspected
   complication of bile leak s/p ERCP and stenting. Admitted for hypoxia
   and hypotension requiring pressor support. Was spiking fevers with no
   clear source of infection, now improving.
   .
   # Hypotension/Recurrent Fevers: Now off levophed, still with daily
   fever.  Most likely infectious source is biliary, but fluid collections
   too small to drain.  No organisms have ever been isolated from many
   cultures/sites.  Also there is some question of whether he is spiking a
   fever due to drug side effect.  Meropenem stopped yesterday [**2-8**] ? drug
   rash.  His leukocytosis has resolved and has no localizing signs.  Dc
   antibiotics [**2174-3-20**].  If fevers are a drug effect, the fevers should
   stop, if it is infectious, then the infection should present itself
   definitively in the absence of antibiotics.
   - follow cultures
   - follow fever curve
   - Continue tube feeds but trend lipase
   - monitoring via arterial line

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Secretions decreased on scopolamine
   patch; started methadone in attempt to decrease sedative use.
   Significant progress on weaning ventilator support.  SBT yesterday went

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension/Recurrent Fevers: The patient's hypotension and recurrent fevers could indicate an ongoing infection or a drug side effect. It is important to monitor the fever curve and follow cultures to determine the cause.

2. Gangrenous cholecystitis and bile leak: The patient had a history of gangrenous cholecystitis with a complication of a bile leak. Monitoring the fluid collection on CT and trends in laboratory values is necessary to assess the progress.

3. Anemia: The patient has stable Hct levels but iron studies indicate iron deficiency. Trending HCT and considering a guaiac stool test can help in managing this condition.

4. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has shown significant progress in weaning ventilator support. Continued monitoring and evaluation are required to ensure successful extubation.

5. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The goal is to diurese and restart beta-blockers, but blood pressure has been low. Restarting Carvedilol once BP stable and holding home Torsemide or lasix gtt are important considerations.

6. Colitis: The etiology of the patient's colitis is unknown, and if diarrhea persists,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU following open CCY surgery with a presentation of gangrenous gallbladder. He has persistent respiratory failure but has shown substantial improvement after completing the antibiotic course and successfully tolerating a spontaneous breathing trial. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 104/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving midazolam infusion and has no known drug allergies. The patient has been weaned off fentanyl and is able to move with limited organized interactions. His fluid balance is negative, indicating fluid removal. The patient's review of systems reveals tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern as indicated by his dependence on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to move towards extubation this morning, but there may be potential complications such as pulmonary edema that could arise post-extubation.
2. Sepsis - Although the patient has shown improvement with antibiotic treatment, there is still a risk of sepsis-related complications, especially considering the ongoing infection from the drain and the need for surgical intervention.
3. Congestive Heart Failure - The patient's congestive heart failure requires careful management with medications such as beta-blockers, Lasix, and ACE inhibitors. There is"

- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure (EF 15%), and recent open cholecystectomy for gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected complication of bile leak.
- The patient presented with hypoxia and hypotension requiring pressor support and was admitted to the ICU.
- He has been experiencing recurrent fevers, but the fever curve is now trending down and he was successfully extubated yesterday.
- The patient has anemia with iron deficiency, and his Hct is stable today.
- He has a gangrenous cholecystitis with a fluid collection on CT scan, and the fluid collection needs to be monitored.
- The patient had a maculopapular trunkal rash after administration of Zosyn, which was thought to be a drug allergy response and has now resolved.
- He has acute on chronic systolic heart failure with an EF of 15-20% and LV dilatation, likely due to EtOH abuse.
- The patient has colitis with unknown etiology, and his diarrhea seems to be slowing down.
- He also has hyperlipidemia, but Gemfibrizol is being held due to acute hepatic/biliary process.

The patient's chief complaint and HPI are not provided. The 24-hour events are not detailed. Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications are listed but without specific details. There are no changes mentioned in the medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for noted below. The review of systems itself is not specified.

The flowsheet data as of [date] includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings. However, without the actual values and details, it is difficult to assess the patient's current condition.

Laboratory results such as WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, Troponin, TCO2, Glucose, and imaging studies are mentioned but images and specific values are not provided. Microbiology and ECG findings are also absent.

The assessment and plan section is incomplete as it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation or treatment strategy. ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), communication, code status, and disposition are all mentioned but without specific information.

The total time spent by the healthcare team with the patient is also not recorded.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with initial admission for a gangrenous gallbladder and now presenting with sepsis resolving and the ability to wean ventilator support. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis, alcohol abuse, and congestive heart failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience difficulty breathing or shortness of breath due to impaired lung function. This can lead to hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels in the blood). Complications may include pneumonia, atelectasis (collapsed lung), or further respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: As the patient is recovering from sepsis, there is a risk of relapse or development of new infections. Complications can include organ dysfunction, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or death.
3. ETOH (Ethanol) Abuse: The patient may experience withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, hallucinations, seizures, or delirium tremens. Thiamine deficiency can also occur, leading to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which affects the nervous system.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient may experience worsening fluid overload, leading to shortness of breath, fatigue, edema, or pulmonary edema. Complications can include cardiac"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol and cocaine abuse, chronic heart failure (ejection fraction 15%), and previously admitted for hypoxia and hypotension requiring pressor support. He underwent an open cholecystectomy due to gangrenous and perforated gallbladder with suspected bile leak, and an ERCP with stenting was performed. The patient was admitted for hypoxia and hypotension and is now improving and successfully extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Recurrent Fevers: The patient had fever spikes with no clear source of infection. The most likely infectious source is biliary, but fluid collections are too small to drain. Cultures have not yielded any organisms, and antibiotics were stopped due to possible drug rash and contribution to fevers. The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and there are no localizing signs. It is recommended to follow cultures and monitor the fever curve.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but was successfully extubated on day 13 and is now on 4L nasal cannula. Oxygen should be weaned as tolerated.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, and iron studies indicate iron deficiency. Trend HCT and guaiac stool should be monitored.

4. Gangrenous Cholecystitis: The patient had gangrenous cholecystitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo M with h/o CHF with EF 15%, gangrenous cholecystitis transferred
   back to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with likely CHF exacerbation and ARF.
   .
   #. Acute systolic CHF: Patient with known CHF prior to admission with
   EF 15% (preadmission EF of 30%). Reasonable to assume the EF will get
   better now that the sepsis has resolved however he will likely always
   have systolic dysfunction given the preceding cardiomyopathy. Current
   CXR and clincal course consistent with acute CHF exacerbation as
   patient did not get his diuretics yesterday AM, got IVF, and now has
   hypoxia.
   - Continue home meds including torsemide
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor I/O and daily weights
   - Wean O2 as able
   - hold ACE inhibitor for now given ARF (Cr 1.3) after one dose of
   lisinopril
   .
   #. ARF: Patient had ARF when first admitted and in septic shock which
   resolved with resolution of shock. Now with ARF again after re-starting
   ACE-I yesterday. FeNa 0.1 suggesting pre-renal azotemia. As this was
   taken AFTER IVF think this is more likely pre-renal from CHF rather
   than hypovolemia - especially since on exam and CXR he seems to not be
   dehydrated.
   - Treat CHF as above
   - Would hold ACE for now
   - Would renally dose meds
   - Would check [**Hospital1 **] lytes, Cr this AM stable at 1.4.
   - Continue coreg and torsemide
   - Will likely need AICD because of low EF which can be done as an
   outpatient and will need to follow up with his primary cardiologist for
   this
   .
   #Leukocytosis: WBC this AM elevated at 12.1. Pt afebrile. Will trend
   for now.
   .
   #. Gangrenous Cholecystitis: Currently resolving, on po diet and
   surgery has signed off with the following recommendations:
   -  wet-to-dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] to abdominal wound
   - drain stays in until repeat ERCP
   - can follow up with primary general surgeon for drain removal (or [**Doctor Last Name **]
   if pt prefers)
   - Monitor JP drain output
   .
   #. Colitis: Patient has history of colitis and is on asacol as an
   outpatient.
   - Monitor stool output
   - Continue mesalamine ->may need to be renally dosed
   .
   # COPD: Patient is not currently wheezing to suggest acute COPD
   exacerbation and clinical history more consistent with HF.
   - Continue ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   .
   #. ETOH Abuse:
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   - SW consult on floor
   .
   #. Iron deficiency anemia: Diagnosed in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] prior to this transfer.
   - Continue iron
   .
   #. Seborrheic Dermatitis:
   - Continue ketoconazole cream

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and gangrenous cholecystitis. He was transferred back to the hospital with likely CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 15% and has shown improvement since the resolution of sepsis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 93/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. He is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and a stress ulcer H2 blocker. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate levels. Imaging shows no pulmonary edema or pneumonia but improved right lower lobe atelectasis. The patient's plan includes continuing home medications, monitoring intake/output and daily weights, weaning off oxygen as able, holding ACE inhibitors due to ARF, and treating CHF exacerbation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute systolic CHF exacerbation: The patient has a history of CHF with a significantly reduced EF of 15%. His clinical course is consistent with an acute CHF exacerbation, evidenced by hypoxia after not receiving diuretics and subsequent IV fluid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of severe congestive heart failure, both acute and chronic. He presented with hypoxia, and his condition has been complicated by hypotension due to medication adjustments requiring a fluid bolus. This has resulted in the patient experiencing modest volume overload and returning to the ICU with hypoxemia, persistent cough, and pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) HYPOXEMIA: The patient may have persistent hypoxemia due to peri-bronchial edema extending into interstitial regions, contributing to hypoxia. There is no evidence of new pneumonia, but the patient's significant and recurrent aspiration events with PO intake may be driving persistent hypoxia. Measures should be taken to wean O2 as tolerated, supervise for possible aspiration, provide continued O2 support, and use incentive spirometry to maintain adequate air-space patency.

2) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient has severe acute and chronic systolic heart failure. Management includes administering Coreg (25mg), Torsemide (40mg), holding ACE-I, and considering a heart failure consult if persistent failure occurs.

3) ALCOHOL ABUSE: There is no evidence of withdrawal, but it is important to monitor the patient closely.

4) SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-Resolved: The patient previously had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, but it has"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo M with h/o CHF with EF 15%, gangrenous cholecystitis transferred
   back to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with likely CHF exacerbation and ARF.
   .
   #. Acute systolic CHF: Patient with known CHF prior to admission with
   EF 15% (preadmission EF of 30%). Reasonable to assume the EF will get
   better now that the sepsis has resolved however he will likely always
   have systolic dysfunction given the preceding cardiomyopathy. Current
   CXR and clincal course consistent with acute CHF exacerbation as
   patient did not get his diuretics yesterday AM, got IVF, and now has
   hypoxia.
   - Continue home meds including torsemide
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor I/O and daily weights
   - Wean O2 as able
   - hold ACE inhibitor for now given ARF (Cr 1.3) after one dose of
   lisinopril
   .
   #. ARF: Patient had ARF when first admitted and in septic shock which
   resolved with resolution of shock. Now with ARF again after re-starting
   ACE-I yesterday. FeNa 0.1 suggesting pre-renal azotemia. As this was
   taken AFTER IVF think this is more likely pre-renal from CHF rather
   than hypovolemia - especially since on exam and CXR he seems to not be
   dehydrated.
   - Treat CHF as above
   - Would hold ACE for now
   - Would renally dose meds
   - Would check [**Hospital1 **] lytes, Cr this AM stable at 1.4.
   - Continue coreg and torsemide
   - Will likely need AICD because of low EF which can be done as an
   outpatient and will need to follow up with his primary cardiologist for
   this
   .
   #Leukocytosis: WBC this AM elevated at 12.1. Pt afebrile. Will trend
   for now.
   .
   #. Gangrenous Cholecystitis: Currently resolving, on po diet and
   surgery has signed off with the following recommendations:
   -  wet-to-dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] to abdominal wound
   - drain stays in until repeat ERCP
   - can follow up with primary general surgeon for drain removal (or [**Doctor Last Name **]
   if pt prefers)
   - Monitor JP drain output
   .
   #. Colitis: Patient has history of colitis and is on asacol as an
   outpatient.
   - Monitor stool output
   - Continue mesalamine ->may need to be renally dosed
   .
   # COPD: Patient is not currently wheezing to suggest acute COPD
   exacerbation and clinical history more consistent with HF.
   - Continue ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   .
   #. ETOH Abuse:
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   - SW consult on floor
   .
   #. Iron deficiency anemia: Diagnosed in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] prior to this transfer.
   - Continue iron
   .
   #. Seborrheic Dermatitis:
   - Continue ketoconazole cream

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and gangrenous cholecystitis. He was transferred back to the ICU with likely CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxia, and elevated white blood cell count. He has a history of COPD, colitis, ETOH abuse, iron deficiency anemia, and seborrheic dermatitis. The patient's current medications include torsemide, lopressor, and heparin. His vital signs are stable, but he requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute systolic CHF exacerbation: The patient has a known history of CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. Given his pre-existing cardiomyopathy, he is likely to have systolic dysfunction. His current CXR and clinical course are consistent with an acute CHF exacerbation. The patient's hypoxia may be due to acute CHF exacerbation as well.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has experienced ARF twice during his hospital stay. Currently, he has a creatinine level of 1.4, indicating renal dysfunction. Pre-renal azotemia is suggested by the low fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa). Treatment for ARF includes managing CHF, holding ACE inhibitors, renally dosing medications, and monitoring electrolyte levels.
3. Gangrenous Cholecystitis: The patient's gangrenous cholecystitis is currently resolving, but he requires ongoing care. Surgical recommendations include wet-to-dry dressing changes for the abdominal wound and monitoring the output of the Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain.
4. Colitis: The patient has a history of colitis and is currently on mesalamine. Close monitoring of stool output and consideration of renally dosing medications may be necessary.
5. COPD: While the patient does not currently exhibit symptoms of an acute COPD exacerbation, his respiratory status should still be closely monitored. Nebulizer treatments with ipratropium and albuterol should be continued.
6. ETOH Abuse: The patient has a history of ETOH abuse, and appropriate interventions, including thiamine and folate supplementation, should continue. A substance abuse worker (SW) consultation on the floor is recommended.
7. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia during his previous hospital stay. Iron supplementation should be continued.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his CHF, ARF, gangrenous cholecystitis, colitis, COPD, ETOH abuse, and iron deficiency anemia."

   61yo M with h/o CHF with EF 15%, gangrenous cholecystitis transferred
   back to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with likely CHF exacerbation and ARF.
   .
   #. Acute systolic CHF: Patient with known CHF prior to admission with
   EF 15% (preadmission EF of 30%). Reasonable to assume the EF will get
   better now that the sepsis has resolved however he will likely always
   have systolic dysfunction given the preceding cardiomyopathy. Current
   CXR and clincal course consistent with acute CHF exacerbation as
   patient did not get his diuretics yesterday AM, got IVF, and now has
   hypoxia.
   - Continue home meds including torsemide
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor I/O and daily weights
   - Wean O2 as able
   - hold ACE inhibitor for now given ARF (Cr 1.3) after one dose of
   lisinopril
   .
   #. ARF: Patient had ARF when first admitted and in septic shock which
   resolved with resolution of shock. Now with ARF again after re-starting
   ACE-I yesterday. FeNa 0.1 suggesting pre-renal azotemia. As this was
   taken AFTER IVF think this is more likely pre-renal from CHF rather
   than hypovolemia - especially since on exam and CXR he seems to not be
   dehydrated.
   - Treat CHF as above
   - Would hold ACE for now
   - Would renally dose meds
   - Would check [**Hospital1 **] lytes, Cr this AM stable at 1.4.
   - Continue coreg and torsemide
   - Will likely need AICD because of low EF which can be done as an
   outpatient and will need to follow up with his primary cardiologist for
   this
   .
   #Leukocytosis: WBC this AM elevated at 12.1. Pt afebrile. Will trend
   for now.
   .
   #. Gangrenous Cholecystitis: Currently resolving, on po diet and
   surgery has signed off with the following recommendations:
   -  wet-to-dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] to abdominal wound
   - drain stays in until repeat ERCP
   - can follow up with primary general surgeon for drain removal (or [**Doctor Last Name **]
   if pt prefers)
   - Monitor JP drain output
   .
   #. Colitis: Patient has history of colitis and is on asacol as an
   outpatient.
   - Monitor stool output
   - Continue mesalamine ->may need to be renally dosed
   .
   # COPD: Patient is not currently wheezing to suggest acute COPD
   exacerbation and clinical history more consistent with HF.
   - Continue ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   .
   #. ETOH Abuse:
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   - SW consult on floor
   .
   #. Iron deficiency anemia: Diagnosed in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] prior to this transfer.
   - Continue iron

   #. Seborrheic Dermatitis:
   - Continue ketoconazole cream

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and gangrenous cholecystitis. He was transferred back to the ICU with likely CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxia, and an increase in right lower lobe atelectasis on chest X-ray. He has a history of COPD, colitis, ETOH abuse, iron deficiency anemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute systolic CHF exacerbation: The patient's known CHF with an ejection fraction of 15% and clinical course suggests an acute exacerbation of systolic CHF. He will likely always have systolic dysfunction due to the preceding cardiomyopathy.
2. ARF: The patient had ARF when admitted initially and it resolved with the resolution of septic shock. Now, he has ARF again after restarting ACE inhibitors. His FeNa is 0.1, indicating pre-renal azotemia possibly due to CHF rather than hypovolemia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated at 12.1, but he is afebrile. It is being monitored for now.
4. Gangrenous cholecystitis: The patient's abdominal wound is currently resolving, and surgery has recommended wet-to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and a low ejection fraction of 15%, who was transferred back to the ICU with suspected CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has gangrenous cholecystitis, which is currently resolving, and a history of colitis. The patient also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), iron deficiency anemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

24-hour events include the administration of diuretics, a change in medication to lopressor for hypotension, sputum culture results, and consultations with various specialists.

Vital signs show hypotension, hypoxia, and an elevated white blood cell count. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 90%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -585 mL.

Imaging reveals atelectasis in the right lower lobe but no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate, as well as low levels of potassium and magnesium. Other lab abnormalities include leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes.

Plan:
1. Hypoxia: Continue to diurese, goal negative 1 to 2 liters, with home torsemide and additional lasix as necessary."

 HYPOXEMIA:  Only occasional cough, clear phlegm.  CXR without
   infiltrates.  Occ. wheeze on exam.  Agree with bronchodilators.  Mild
   CHF, now back on diuresis, received extra dose of lasix.  Plan to
   restart ACE I, start with low dose.  Follow BUN/Cr.  Weaning Fi02 as
   tolerated.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE: Had been tolerating diet.  Vomited oatmeal this
   morning.   Exam benign.  Will continue diet as tolerated.  If recurrent
   emesis will check repeat labs to be sure there is no exacerbation of
   underlying
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Seems to be at his baseline looking back at
   course in the ICU previously.  Trying to optimize CHF meds to improve

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient's chief complaints are hypotension and hypoxia. The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn (rash), cephalosporins (fever/chills), and last dose of antibiotics. The patient has been receiving various medications including torsemide, IV lasix, coreg changed to lopressor, and continues on 6 L NC.

The patient is comfortable sitting up in bed and has minimal cough with clear phlegm. They had oatmeal for breakfast and then experienced emesis, but denied feeling nauseous and had no abdominal pain. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, emesis, and fatigue.

Vital signs show t-max of 37.7 C (99.9 F), current temperature of 36 C (96.8 F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/61 to 110/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 75.2 kg and height is 70 inches.

The patient has received fluids totaling 1,215 mL, with 370 mL given over the past 24 hours. They have received 965 mL orally, 250 mL intravenously, and have had a total output of 1,800 mL of urine, with 1,440 mL output over the past 24 hours.

The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a SpO2 of 94%. The ABG results are as follows: pH: 27, PaCO2: 32, HCO3: 24, and O2 Sat: 94%.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished with PERRL eyes, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes within normal limits, normal cardiovascular exam, clear breath sounds with occasional end expiratory wheeze, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no lower extremity edema.

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo M with h/o CHF with EF 15%, gangrenous cholecystitis transferred
   back to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with likely CHF exacerbation and ARF.
   .
   #. Hypoxia:  likely due to CHF + baseline COPD.  CXR yesterday am with
   vascular congestion.  Will continue to diurese, goal negative 1 to 2
   liters, with his home torsemide, and additional lasix as necessary.
   Appreciate cardiology input.
   - Continue home meds including torsemide
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor I/O and daily weights
   - Wean O2 as able
   .
   #. CHF
 continue metoprolol, torsemide, additional diuresis as above.
   .
   #. ARF: Improved
   - Treat CHF as above
   - renally dose meds
   - Would check [**Hospital1 **] lytes, Cr this AM improved at 1.1.
   - Continue coreg and torsemide
   - Will likely need AICD because of low EF which can be done as an
   outpatient and will need to follow up with his primary cardiologist for
   this.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Resolved. WBC this AM 8.6. Pt afebrile. Will trend.
   -          trend WBC
   .
   #. Gangrenous Cholecystitis: Currently resolving, on po diet and
   surgery has signed off with the following recommendations:
   -  wet-to-dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] to abdominal wound
   - drain stays in until repeat ERCP
   - can follow up with primary general surgeon for drain removal (or [**Doctor Last Name **]
   if pt prefers)
   - Monitor JP drain output
   .
   #. Colitis: Patient has history of colitis and is on asacol as an
   outpatient.
   - Monitor stool output
   - Continue mesalamine ->may need to be renally dosed
   .
   # COPD: Patient is not currently wheezing to suggest acute COPD
   exacerbation and clinical history more consistent with HF.
   -          Continue ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   -          Consider starting [**Last Name (un) **]/steroid inhaler if she remains
   hypoxic with no e/o infection
   .
   #. ETOH Abuse:
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   - SW
   .
   #. Iron deficiency anemia: Diagnosed in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] prior to this transfer.
   - Continue iron
   .
   #. Seborrheic Dermatitis:
   - Continue ketoconazole cream

   ICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU residents, the
   assessment and plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would add
   and emphasize the following.
   Patient has been hemodynamically stable.  No further emesis, tolerated
   breakfast this morning.  No abdominal pain.  Diarrhea. Denies SOB,
   cough.  SaO2 95% on 6L NC, desats to 91% on 4L.
   Lungs with prolonged expiratory phase, occasional wheeze.  Crackles at
   bases clear with deep breathing.
   Abdomen soft, good bowel sounds
   CXR without CHF, infiltrates
   [**Month (only) 8**] benefit from further optimization of COPD regimen, will give short
   course of prednisone and initiate ICS, continue bronchodilators.
   Maintain even I/Os to slightly negative.  Agree with detailed plan as
   above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and a low ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, who was transferred to the ICU with likely CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient also has a history of gangrenous cholecystitis, colitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ethanol abuse, iron deficiency anemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

24-hour events include occasional hypotension in the 70s systolic, which was asymptomatic. The patient received a bolus of 500 ccs for hypotension, but remained negative. The patient had to discontinue beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor due to low blood pressure.

Current vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 82/56 mmHg to 113/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula, and a weight loss of 1.9 kg since admission.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1170 mL and a total output of 2855 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1685 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been weaned off mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo M with h/o CHF with EF 15%, gangrenous cholecystitis transferred
   back to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with likely CHF exacerbation and ARF.
   .
   #. Hypoxia:  likely due to CHF + baseline COPD.  CXR yesterday am with
   vascular congestion.  Will continue to diurese, goal negative 1 to 2
   liters, with his home torsemide, and additional lasix as necessary.
   Appreciate cardiology input.
   - Continue home meds including torsemide
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor I/O and daily weights
   - Wean O2 as able
   .
   #. CHF
 continue metoprolol, torsemide, additional diuresis as above.
   .
   #. ARF: Improved
   - Treat CHF as above
   - renally dose meds
   - Would check [**Hospital1 **] lytes, Cr this AM improved at 1.1.
   - Continue coreg and torsemide
   - Will likely need AICD because of low EF which can be done as an
   outpatient and will need to follow up with his primary cardiologist for
   this.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Resolved. WBC this AM 8.6. Pt afebrile. Will trend.
   -          trend WBC
   .
   #. Gangrenous Cholecystitis: Currently resolving, on po diet and
   surgery has signed off with the following recommendations:
   -  wet-to-dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] to abdominal wound
   - drain stays in until repeat ERCP
   - can follow up with primary general surgeon for drain removal (or [**Doctor Last Name **]
   if pt prefers)
   - Monitor JP drain output
   .
   #. Colitis: Patient has history of colitis and is on asacol as an
   outpatient.
   - Monitor stool output
   - Continue mesalamine ->may need to be renally dosed
   .
   # COPD: Patient is not currently wheezing to suggest acute COPD
   exacerbation and clinical history more consistent with HF.
   -          Continue ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   -          Consider starting [**Last Name (un) **]/steroid inhaler if she remains
   hypoxic with no e/o infection
   .
   #. ETOH Abuse:
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   - SW
   .
   #. Iron deficiency anemia: Diagnosed in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] prior to this transfer.
   - Continue iron

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction of 15%, who was transferred back to the hospital with likely CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). He also has a history of gangrenous cholecystitis, colitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ethanol abuse, iron deficiency anemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

The patient is currently being treated in the ICU and is receiving various medications including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, and others. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 82/56 mmHg to 113/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90%, and sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and lactate, along with decreased levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelets. Other lab values such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal range.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxia due to CHF and underlying COPD. The plan is to continue diuresis"

   Disposition: To cardiology pending decreased O2 requirement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who was admitted to the ICU for suspected acute exacerbation of CHF and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath and hypoxia. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including diuretics (torsemide and Lasix), beta-blockers (Lopressor), and corticosteroids (prednisone). He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently on inhalers and other medications to manage his symptoms. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, indicating potential renal dysfunction. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased from previous values, suggesting improvement in leukocytosis. Imaging shows resolution of fluid overload and mild atelectasis in the right upper lobe, but moderate cardiomegaly is still present. 

The patient's current medical conditions include likely CHF exacerbation, ARF, COPD, and a history of gangrenous cholecystitis. Additionally, he has been diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia and seborrheic dermatitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of CHF symptoms, further deterioration of renal function, exacerbation of COPD, and potential infections due to the presence of indwelling lines"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with shortness of breath and hypoxia. He has been in the ICU for several days, showing occasional hypotension in the 70s systolic, but remained asymptomatic. The patient received a bolus of 500 cc's for hypotension, but remained negative 475 cc. Lopressor and ACE were discontinued due to low blood pressure. Despite being negative 2.5 liters since readmission to the unit, the patient still requires 6 liters of oxygen, so prednisone and fluticasone inhalers were started.

The patient has allergies to Zosyn (rash) and cephalosporins (fever/chills). The last dose of antibiotics was on [**2174-3-27**] 09:09 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for occasional hypotension. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

Physical examination findings are not provided in the note.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values, including liver enzymes, kidney function, electrolytes, and calcium, are within normal range. Imaging shows improvement in lung volumes, resolution of overhydration, persistent mild atelect"

   Disposition: Callout to cardiology
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of hypoxia and an acute exacerbation of CHF. The patient also has a history of gangrenous cholecystitis, acute kidney injury (ARF), colitis, alcohol/cocaine abuse, iron deficiency anemia, and seborrheic dermatitis. He is currently being treated for these conditions and is showing improvement in his overall condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation indicate a potential complication related to his underlying COPD and CHF. Close monitoring of oxygen levels and adjustments to the oxygen delivery device may be necessary.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock due to further deterioration of cardiac function. Monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output will be important.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of mild atelectasis at the bases of the right upper lobe on the chest X-ray suggests a potential risk for developing pneumonia. Frequent assessment of respiratory symptoms and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics may be required.
4. Fluid overload: Although the patient's recent chest X-ray shows improvement in fluid overload, careful monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and a low ejection fraction of 15%, as well as gangrenous cholecystitis. He was transferred back to the ICU with likely CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been on 4L oxygen via nasal cannula and is currently not in acute distress. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to require a significant amount of oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show improved renal function with a creatinine level of 1.1 today. His WBC count has resolved from leukocytosis, and he is afebrile. The patient's imaging shows resolution of vascular congestion seen previously, indicating improved ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's shortness of breath and requirement for 4L oxygen suggest ongoing respiratory distress. The underlying causes could be severe CHF exacerbation or baseline COPD.
2. CHF Exacerbation: Given the patient's history of CHF with a low ejection fraction of 15%, his current symptoms are consistent with an exacerbation. Monitoring fluid balance, daily weights, and cardiac input is crucial.
3. COPD Exacerbation: Although the patient's clinical history points more towards HF, his oxygen requirement has not improved despite diuresis, suggesting a possible second process or COPD exacerbation.
