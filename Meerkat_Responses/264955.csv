The patient presented with a syncopal episode at the outpatient clinic, which was bradycardic in nature.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are as follows:

1. Loss of consciousness: The patient experienced a syncopal episode, which could be due to a vasovagal response with bradycardia, mucus plugging, or cardiac causes such as arrhythmia, myocardial infarction (MI), or aortic stenosis. An echocardiogram has been ordered to rule out outflow obstruction and wall motion abnormality. The patient will be monitored for arrhythmias on telemetry and medications like Seroquel and lorazepam will be held.

2. Aspiration pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration PNA. Treatment includes the administration of vancomycin andzosyn, obtaining sputum cultures, and monitoring for any signs of deterioration.

3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient appears somewhat volume overloaded, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated. The ejection fraction (EF) is unknown. Lasix will be given intr"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 52yo M with DM, CRF, recent motorcycle trauma s/p ex-lap, trach
   and peg, presents after bradycardic syncopal episode at outpatient
   clinic today.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness:  Possibly mucous plug or CHF exacerbation.
   ECHO yesterday not suggestive of CHF though pt. had already clinically
   improved.   Mental status today appears at baseline
   - hold seroquel and lorazepam tonight as still drowsy
   - continue to treat with broad-spectrum abxs for possible sepsis and
   follow cultures
   .
   # Aspiration PNA: Sputum growing MRSA
   - Cont. Vanc; stop zosyn
   - nasal viral swab and urine legionella
   - will attempt trach collar today without vent
   .
   #CHF: patient still appears somewhat volume overloaded.  ECHO does not
   suggest severe CHF.   Was on lasix 80 mg daily at home prior to
   accident, but has only been getting 20 mg at rehab.  Received 20 mg
   lasix after transfusion earlier this morning.
   - Lasix 40mg early this afternoon.
   - cont imdur
   - cont amlodipine
   .
   # ARF: 2.3 today.  Likely elevated due to contrast load from CTA.
   - will monitor
   - cont Phoslo 667mg PO TID
   .
   # HTN:
   - cont hydralazine, amlodipine and imdur
   .
   # CAD
   - uptitrate B-blocker as BP tolerates.
   - cont amlodipine
   - continue ASA
   - continue Imdur

   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue Gemfibrozil
   - check fasting lipids as pt. is not on many of his previous outpatient
   lipid medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and recent motorcycle trauma who presented to the outpatient clinic with a bradycardic syncopal episode. He underwent exploratory laparotomy, tracheostomy, and peg tube placement. The patient has multiple surgical incisions, some with erythema but no discharge. He is currently intubated in the ICU and is receiving invasive ventilation, which was stopped at 3:00 PM. He has a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit and has undergone various tests including a trans-thoracic echo, CTA and CT of the abdomen with PO contrast, speech and swallow consult for Passy Muir valve placement, wound care consult, and nephrologist consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia (PNA): The patient's sputum gram stain shows growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs), Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and Gram-positive rods (GPRs), suggesting a mixed bacterial infection. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin (Vanc) and Zosyn, and cultures are pending. It is important to monitor for any worsening respiratory symptoms or changes in mental status.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient appears somewhat volume overloaded, and his B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated. The patient's ejection fraction (EF)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-inch tall, 130 kg male admitted to the ICU with a history of pneumonia, aspiration, anemia, trauma, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on invasive ventilation. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics since admission, including metronidazole, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 128/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has decreased from 132 kg at admission to 130 kg currently. The patient has received a total of 3,159 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 2,660 mL. The patient is receiving medications such as lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and furosemide. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels. The patient's blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination were not assessed. The patient's condition is being managed with ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated and on invasive ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining proper lung hygiene and regularly assessing and treating any potential infections.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium infusion should be continued to prevent clot formation.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and prolonged bed rest may increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylactic medications like lansoprazole should be continued to prevent gastric ulcers.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and proper skin care should be implemented to prevent further complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a compromised respiratory system. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and timely intervention are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an ongoing infection. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored based on culture and sensitivity results to effectively treat any underlying infection."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with a motorcycle injury and multiple fractures. He has been tracheostomized and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient presented with symptoms of increasing lower extremity edema and shortness of breath, leading to cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and intubated in the emergency department before being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient has been febrile and has received two units of blood transfusion. He was found to be volume overloaded and placed back on mechanical ventilation. The note mentions that the patient is critically ill, and the attending physician agrees with the ICU resident's assessment and plan.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/63 mmHg to 159/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilatory support. The patient is receiving medications such as pantoprazole, insulin glargine, and other ICU medications.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight and has distended abdomen. The peripheral pulses are diminished in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal minimal abdominal fluid and no radiographic evidence"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital for a motorcycle injury with multiple fractures, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He experienced a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been febrile and has been receiving multiple antibiotics. He is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, and his condition has been complicated by pneumonia, trauma, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, and acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potential sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a severe compromise in lung function, which may require ongoing ventilatory support and could lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's abdominal wound requires ongoing care to prevent infection and promote healing. Breakdown of the skin barrier can increase the risk of infection and delayed wound healing.
4. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient's acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic CHF may result in fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output, potentially leading to cardiogenic shock"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 52yo M with DM, CRF, recent motorcycle trauma s/p ex-lap, trach
   and peg, presents after bradycardic syncopal episode at outpatient
   clinic today.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness:  Possibly mucous plug or CHF exacerbation.
   ECHO yesterday not suggestive of CHF though pt. had already clinically
   improved.   Mental status today appears at baseline
   - hold seroquel and lorazepam tonight as still drowsy
   - stop abx for now as pt is likely MRSA carrier and is no longer
   febrile, unlikely to have PNA
   - continue to diurese with goal -1L today
   .
   # Aspiration PNA: Sputum growing MRSA; however pt is likely colonized
   and this does not represent true PNA.
   - abx stopped; will consider restarting if persistently hypoxic or
   febrile
   - nasal viral swab and urine legionella
   - trach collar today
   .
   #CHF: patient still appears somewhat volume overloaded.  ECHO does not
   suggest severe CHF.   Was on lasix 80 mg daily at home prior to
   accident, but has only been getting 20 mg at rehab.
   - Lasix 40mg IV X 1 this AM, will assess later and aim for -1L today
   - cont imdur
   - cont amlodipine
   .
   # ARF: 2.3 today.  Likely elevated due to contrast load from CTA.  Also
   baseline had elevated creatinine which is stable.
   - will monitor
   - cont Phoslo 667mg PO TID
   .
   # HTN:
   - cont hydralazine, amlodipine and imdur
   .
   # CAD
   - uptitrate B-blocker as BP tolerates.
   - cont amlodipine
   - continue ASA
   - continue Imdur
   .
   # DM: QID fingersticks, continue lantus.
   - Humalog SS
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue Gemfibrozil
   - f/u fasting lipids.
   .
   # s/p trauma with multiple surgeries.  Wound care consult recs
   received.  Surgery reviewed and recommends damp to dry dressings
   throughout.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds started [**12-18**]; cont reglan

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and a recent motorcycle trauma who underwent an exploratory laparotomy, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient presented with a bradycardic syncopal episode at the outpatient clinic.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Loss of Consciousness: The patient may have experienced a mucous plug or an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). Although an echo yesterday did not suggest CHF, the patient has clinically improved. The mental status today appears to be at baseline, so it is recommended to hold seroquel and lorazepam tonight as the patient is still drowsy.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has sputum growing MRSA, but it is likely that the patient is colonized, and this does not represent true PNA. Therefore, antibiotics should be stopped, and the patient should be monitored for persistent hypoxia or fever. A nasal viral swab and urine legionella test should be considered.
3. CHF: The patient still appears somewhat volume overloaded. Although the echo does not suggest severe CHF, the patient was on lasix 80 mg daily at home prior to the accident but has only been receiving 20 mg at rehab. It is recommended to administer Lasix 40mg IV once and aim for a negative"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and a history of recent motorcycle trauma who underwent exploratory laparotomy, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He presented with a bradycardic syncopal episode at the outpatient clinic today. The patient has multiple medical complications including aspiration pneumonia (MRSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypercholesterolemia, and multiple surgical wounds. He is currently in the ICU for further work-up and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Loss of consciousness: The patient experienced a bradycardic syncopal episode, which could be due to a mucous plug or exacerbation of CHF. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Aspiration pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He is currently receiving appropriate antibiotics, including vancomycin, and the tracheostomy collar will be attempted without ventilation.
3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient appears somewhat volume overloaded, but the echo does not suggest severe CHF. His previous medication regimen included Lasix 80 mg daily, which has been reduced to 20 mg at rehab and"

   # Loss of Consciousness:  Possibly mucous plug or CHF exacerbation.
   ECHO yesterday not suggestive of CHF though pt. had already clinically
   improved.   Mental status today appears at baseline
   - hold seroquel and lorazepam tonight as still drowsy
   - continue to treat with broad-spectrum abxs for possible sepsis and
   follow cultures
   .
   # Aspiration PNA: Sputum growing MRSA
   - Cont. Vanc; stop zosyn
   - nasal viral swab and urine legionella
   - will attempt trach collar today without vent
   .
   #CHF: patient still appears somewhat volume overloaded.  ECHO does not
   suggest severe CHF.   Was on lasix 80 mg daily at home prior to
   accident, but has only been getting 20 mg at rehab.  Received 20 mg
   lasix after transfusion earlier this morning.
   - Lasix 40mg early this afternoon.
   - cont imdur
   - cont amlodipine

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and a recent history of motorcycle trauma who underwent exploratory laparotomy, tracheostomy, and peg tube placement. The patient presented with a bradycardic syncopal episode at the outpatient clinic today. The patient's mental status is at baseline, and there are no signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) on the recent echocardiogram. The patient is currently being treated for possible sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has aspiration pneumonia (PNA) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for which vancomycin has been continued, and Zosyn has been stopped. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/71 mmHg to 162/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention but shows a thick neck, tracheostomy tube in place without erythema or swelling. There are rhonchi on the left lower lobe and coarse crackles in the right lower lobe. The patient's abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with somewhat tense and tender midline incision, with erythema but no discharge. The patient's extrem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and prolonged hospital stay. The patient coded at an outpatient visit and is likely experiencing fluid overload and a vagal episode. 

The patient has been well since yesterday, afebrile, and tolerated tracheostomy (TM) for the day, requiring ventilation overnight and back on TM today. The patient's allergies include Lisinopril (Zestril) with a reported side effect of lightheadedness. 

The patient received various antibiotics such as Metronidazole, Levofloxacin, Piperacillin, and Vancomycin. Other medications administered include Furosemide (Lasix), glargine/SSI, calcium, lipid, hydralazine, reglan, asa, thiamine, vancomycin, protonix, lasix, norvasc, isordil, lopressor, and hep s/q.

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except as noted above and below. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), current temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 56 bpm (54-69 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 110/50-140/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (8-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. 

The patient's weight is currently 130 kg and has a height of 70 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,991 mL and output of 2,990 mL, with urine output of 2,990 mL. 

The patient is on respiratory support using a tracheostomy mask with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The tidal volume (Vt) is 478 mL (161-619 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 67. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O, and the patient's SpO2 remains at 99%.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress, normal eye/conjunctival examination, normocephalic head/ears/nose/throat examination, normal cardiovascular examination, peripheral vascular examination, respiratory/chest examination, and neurologic examination. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.1-8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 21.2-21.8%, platelet (Plt) count of 144-154 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.0-2.3 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.10-0.11 ng/mL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 34 mmol/L, glucose level of 109-135 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

   A/P: 52yo M with DM, CRF, recent motorcycle trauma s/p ex-lap, trach
   and peg, presents after bradycardic syncopal episode at outpatient
   clinic today.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness:  Likely syncopal episode and bradycardia,
   given swift response to atropine and chest compressions. Possibly
   mucous plug or CHF exacerbation.  ECHO yesterday not suggestive of CHF
   though pt. had already clinically improved.   Mental status today
   appears at baseline
   - stop abx for now as pt is likely MRSA carrier and is no longer
   febrile, unlikely to have PNA
   - continue to diurese with goal -1L today
   .
   # Aspiration PNA: Sputum growing MRSA; however pt is likely colonized
   and this does not represent true PNA.
   - abx stopped; will consider restarting if persistently hypoxic or
   febrile
   - nasal viral swab and urine legionella
   #CHF: patient still appears somewhat volume overloaded.  ECHO does not
   suggest severe CHF.   Was on lasix 80 mg daily at home prior to
   accident, but has only been getting 20 mg at rehab.  On a large
   assortment of cardiac medications
   - Transition to home dose of 80 mg PO q AM
   -PM lytes
   - cont imdur
   - cont amlodipine
   .
   # ARF: 2.3 today.  Likely elevated due to contrast load from CTA.  Pt
   is now back at baseline elevated creatinine.  Renal artery stenosis
   would cause both renal insufficiency and htn, so may be cause of both.
   - will continue to monitor BUN, Cr, and potassium.
   - cont Phoslo 667mg PO TID
   # HTN:  Given several medications, should be worked up for secondary
   causes of htn, including RAS.
   -          cont hydralazine, amlodipine and imdur
   -          hold on ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] given renal insufficiency

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and a history of recent motorcycle trauma who underwent exploratory laparotomy, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The patient presented to the outpatient clinic with a bradycardic syncopal episode, which was likely due to a mucous plug or congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's mental status appears to be at baseline.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions and has ongoing medical concerns:

1. Loss of consciousness: The patient experienced a syncopal episode with bradycardia, which responded well to atropine and chest compressions. This could be due to a mucous plug or congestive heart failure exacerbation. An echocardiogram yesterday did not suggest congestive heart failure.

2. Aspiration pneumonia (PNA): The patient's sputum is growing MRSA, but it is likely that the patient is colonized with MRSA and does not have true pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy has been stopped, but may be restarted if the patient becomes hypoxic or febrile. Nasal viral swab and urine Legionella testing have been ordered.

3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient appears somewhat volume overloaded. An echocardiogram does not suggest severe CHF. The patient was on Lasix 80 mg daily at home, but has only been receiving 20 mg at rehab"

The patient presented with a bradycardic syncopal episode at an outpatient clinic today.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 57 bpm with sinus bradycardia, blood pressure ranging from 142/68 to 158/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention but has a thick neck with a tracheostomy in place without erythema or swelling. There are rhonchi on the left lower lobe and coarse crackles in the right lower lobe of the lungs. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft with somewhat tense peritoneum along the midline incision, with an incision that has erythema but no discharge. There is diffuse swelling in the extremities due to multiple surgical incisions that are starting to heal well. The skin examination reveals psoriasis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and recent motorcycle trauma who presented with a bradycardic syncopal episode at the outpatient clinic. He has undergone an exploratory laparotomy, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's mental status appears to be at baseline, and he is no longer febrile. However, he remains drowsy and is being held on seroquel and lorazepam. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, with an SpO2 of 99%. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 163/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and sinus bradycardia. The patient's weight is currently 130 kg, and his height is 70 inches.

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including an echocardiogram, blood cultures, a nasal viral swab, urine legionella, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA). The results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin-T, and creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include loss of consciousness, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypercholesterolemia, and a recent trauma with multiple surgeries. The treatment plan involves holding seroquel and lorazepam, stopping antibiotics, continuing diuresis with the goal of removing 1 liter of fluid, restarting antibiotics if the patient becomes hypoxic or febrile, and implementing tracheostomy collar. The patient is also being managed for CHF, ARF, HTN, CAD, DM, and hypercholesterolemia. Wound care consult recommendations have been received, and the patient may be discharged to a rehabilitation facility tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Loss of consciousness: The patient's syncopal episode could be due to a mucous plug or exacerbation of congestive heart failure. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Aspiration PNA: The patient has a sputum culture growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which may indicate aspiration pneumonia. However, it is likely that the patient is colonized with MRSA rather than having true pneumonia. The decision to restart antibiotics will depend on the patient's clinical condition.
3. CHF: The patient appears somewhat volume overloaded, and the echocardiogram does not suggest severe"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 52yo M with DM, CRF, recent motorcycle trauma s/p ex-lap, trach
   and peg, presents after bradycardic syncopal episode at outpatient
   clinic today.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness:  Possibly mucous plug or CHF exacerbation.
   ECHO yesterday not suggestive of CHF though pt. had already clinically
   improved.   Mental status appears at baseline.  Unclear overall
   etiology; however patient is improved clinically.
   - - stop abx for now as pt is likely MRSA carrier and is no longer
   febrile, unlikely to have PNA
   - continue home Lasix for CHF
   .
   # Anemia: workup for anemia has included guiac which is negative, iron
   studies consistent with iron-deficiency, retic count elevated.  Pt has
   had 2 CT scans of abdomen/pelvis which are negative for any source of
   bleeding as well as CT of the leg for bleeding into the thigh which is
   negative.  Records indicate that this is a chronic problem since his
   trauma 6 weeks ago and he has had occasional transfusions.  He did
   receive 1 unit PRBCs on admission.  Pt is asymptomatic from his anemia
   without tachycardia, hypotension, lightheadedness or fatigue.
   - recommend starting iron for iron-deficiency
   - can follow-up with outpatient hematology regarding further workup as
   this is not an inpatient issue
   - will transfuse 1 unit pRBCs today despite pt being asymptomatic in
   order to increase hematocrit prior to discharge.
   .
   #CHF: patient may be somewhat volume overloaded although has been
   improving.  ECHO does not suggest severe CHF.   Was on lasix 80 mg
   daily at home prior to accident, but has only been getting 20 mg at
   rehab.
   - will continue home lasix of 80mg PO qday
   - cont imdur
   - cont amlodipine
   .
   # ARF: 1.8 today which is close to baseline.  ARF is resolved.  Likely
   elevated due to contrast load from CTA.
   - will monitor
   - cont Phoslo 667mg PO TID
   .
   # HTN:
   - cont hydralazine, amlodipine and imdur
   .
   # CAD
   - continue b-blocker
   - cont amlodipine
   - continue ASA
   - continue Imdur
   .
   # DM: QID fingersticks, continue lantus.
   - Humalog SS
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue Gemfibrozil
   .
   # s/p trauma with multiple surgeries.  Wound care consult recs
   received. Surgery recommended damp to dry dressings.
   - per trauma surgery, okay to continue with aquacel dressing changes
   per wound care
   - manage trach and peg at outpatient surgery
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds started [**12-18**]; cont reglan

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic renal failure (CRF), and a history of recent motorcycle trauma who underwent exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap), tracheostomy (trach), and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg). The patient presented with a bradycardic syncopal episode at an outpatient clinic.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Loss of Consciousness: The patient had a syncopal episode, possibly due to a mucous plug or exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). An echocardiogram (ECHO) was performed yesterday and did not suggest CHF. The patient's mental status appears to be at baseline, and the overall etiology is unclear. However, the patient has clinically improved.

2. Anemia: The patient has anemia with iron deficiency, elevated reticulocyte count, and negative guaiac test. Iron studies are consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on admission. He is asymptomatic from his anemia without experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, lightheadedness, or fatigue.

3. CHF: The patient may be somewhat volume overloaded, although he has been improving. The ECHO does not suggest severe CHF. The patient was on lasix 80 mg daily at home"
