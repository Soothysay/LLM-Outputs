   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo m with hx of sCHF, MVR, and Tricuspid ring, PAF, admitted to [**Hospital1 2259**]
   with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with
   lasix driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. Was initially
   admitted to CCU for ionotrope assisted diuresis but diuresed 7.8 L
   during his ICU stay on lasix gtt alone. Now, having further problems
   with diuresis on the floor and being transferred to the CCU again from
   inotrope-assisted diuresis.
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is in the midst
   of a prolonged hospitalization for acute on chronic systolic heart
   failure. Clinically, he appears volume overloaded, with pitting edema
   in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. Of note, his lungs are
   relatively clear on exam. His most recent echo shows an EF of <20%. His
   current weight is 164.2 lbs, which is up from his self-reported dry
   weight of 135 lbs. He was transferred to the CCU for intotrope-assisted
   diuresis. On arrival to the CCU, we increased his Lasix gtt rate and he
   has been putting out good urine since then.
   - continue Lasix gtt at 20 cc/hr
   - consider adding milrinone for inotropic support if UOP does not
   improve with lasix
   - consider Swan for hemodynamic assessment if UOP worsens
   - continue digoxin to further augment contractility
   - continue metolazone [**Hospital1 **] to help with diuresis
   - continue captopril
   - strict I/O's and daily weights, with goal of maximum diuresis as BP
   will allow
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing, repleting as needed
   - Low sodium diet with 1L fluid restriction
   - no ICD, per patient wishes
   - consider viability study this week to look for any treatable
   ischemia; will d/w with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # Runs of Vtach: Per signout from cardiology floor team, the patient
   has been having frequent runs of Vtach. Of note, the patient has
   expressed that he does not wish to have an ICD, as he requires frequent
   MRI's because of his h/o pancreatic cysts.
   - continue telemetry
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   # Paroxysmal AFib: Patient currently in atrial fibrillation.
   Uncontrolled rate could place a role in HF exacerbation; however, pt
   currently with normal HR. Beta blocker on hold [**2-26**] bradycardia.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - metoprolol on hold, as above
   - digoxin for rate control
   - continue coumadin for INR goal of [**2-27**]
   - repeat ECG
   # Acute Renal Failure: Recent baseline Cr has been ~1.2 to 1.5. Pt
   presented this hospitalization with a Cr of 2.2, likely from poor
   forward flow. With diuresis, the patient's Cr improved to 1.1, now
   increased to 1.6. FeUrea c/w pre-renal state, likely secondary to poor
   forward flow in the setting of HF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Hyponatremia: ? hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting of fluid
   overload.
   - diuresis as above
   - fluid restriction as above
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Microcytic Anemia: Per primary team notes, patient with falling Hct
   from admission. Source not clear. Pt has reportedly been guaiac
   negative. Hct recently has been stable.
   - continue to guaiac stools and trend Hct
   - maintain active type and screen
   - consider transfusion for hct<25
   # Thrombocytopoenia: Stable. Per primary team notes, HIT and ITP ruled
   out; might be due to marrow suppression.
   - continue to trend platelets
   - platelet count not low enough for bleeding complications at this
   point but will be cautious of complications if platelet count continues
   to drop
   # Cholestatic Transaminitis: likely due to hepatic congestion.
   Improving. Benign abdominal exam.
   - continue to trend LFT's
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home atorvastatin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid ring, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with lasix-driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing several medical complications.

1. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient appears volume overloaded with pitting edema in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. His most recent echo shows an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 20%. His current weight is 164.2 lbs, which is up from his self-reported dry weight of 135 lbs. The plan includes continuing Lasix gtt at 20 cc/hr, considering adding milrinone for inotropic support if urine output does not improve with Lasix, considering a Swan for hemodynamic assessment if urine output worsens, continuing digoxin to further augment contractility, and continuing metolazone to help with diuresis.

2. Runs of Vtach: The patient has been having frequent runs of ventricular tachycardia. Telemetry should be continued, and electrolytes should be monitored while diuresing.

3. Paroxysmal AFib: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation. Uncontrolled rate could place a role in HF exacerbation, but the patient is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid ring, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing persistent hypotension despite diuresis with Lasix. The patient's current weight is 164.2 lbs, which is higher than his self-reported dry weight of 135 lbs.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), a heart rate of 69 bpm with a range of 63-87 bpm, blood pressure of 84/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with an irregular rhythm.

Physical examination reveals alertness, no abnormalities in the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, an irregular rhythm, and a holosystolic murmur at the apex. There is no chest wall deformity, scoliosis, or kyphosis, and the lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen is soft, nontender, with bowel sounds present. Pitting edema is noted in the bilateral lower extremities up to the thighs, and there is also dependent pitting edema.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo m with hx of sCHF, MVR, and Tricuspid ring, PAF, admitted to [**Hospital1 2259**]
   with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with
   lasix driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. Was initially
   admitted to CCU for ionotrope assisted diuresis but diuresed 7.8 L
   during his ICU stay on lasix gtt alone. Now, having further problems
   with diuresis on the floor and being transferred to the CCU again from
   inotrope-assisted diuresis.
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is in the midst
   of a prolonged hospitalization for acute on chronic systolic heart
   failure. Clinically, he appears volume overloaded, with pitting edema
   in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. Of note, his lungs are
   relatively clear on exam. His most recent echo shows an EF of <20%. His
   current weight is 164.2 lbs, which is up from his self-reported dry
   weight of 135 lbs. He is currently being transferred to the CCU for
   intotrope-assisted diuresis.
   - will increase lasix gtt to see if that improve urine output
   - consider adding milrinone for inotropic support if UOP does not
   improve with lasix
   - consider adding pressors for BP support if necessary
   - continue digoxin to further augment contractility
   - continue metolazone [**Hospital1 **] to help with diuresis
   - continue captopril
   - strict I/O's and daily weights, with goal of maximum diuresis as BP
   will allow
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing, repleting as needed
   - Low sodium diet with 1L fluid restriction
   - no ICD, per patient wishes
   - consider viability study this week to look for any treatable
   ischemia; will d/w with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # Runs of Vtach: Per signout from cardiology floor team, the patient
   has been having frequent runs of Vtach. Of note, the patient has
   expressed that he does not wish to have an ICD, as he requires frequent
   MRI's because of his h/o pancreatic cysts.
   - continue telemetry
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   # Paroxysmal AFib: Patient currently in atrial fibrillation.
   Uncontrolled rate could place a role in HF exacerbation; however, pt
   currently with normal HR. Beta blocker on hold [**2-26**] bradycardia.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - metoprolol on hold, as above
   - digoxin for rate control
   - continue coumadin for INR goal of [**2-27**]
   - repeat ECG
   # Acute Renal Failure: Recent baseline Cr has been ~1.2 to 1.5. Pt
   presented this hospitalization with a Cr of 2.2, likely from poor
   forward flow. With diuresis, the patient's Cr improved to 1.1, now
   increased to 1.6 - poor forward flow vs. ATN.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - will obtain urine lytes
   # Hyponatremia: ? hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting of fluid
   overload.
   - diuresis as above
   - fluid restriction as above
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Microcytic Anemia: Per primary team notes, patient with falling Hct
   from admission. Source not clear. Pt has reportedly been guaiac
   negative. Hct recently has been stable.
   - continue to guaiac stools and trend Hct
   - maintain active type and screen
   # Thrombocytopoenia: Stable. Per primary team notes, HIT and ITP ruled
   out; might be due to marrow suppression.
   - continue to trend platelets
   - platelet count not low enough for bleeding complications at this
   point but will be cautious of complications if platelet count continues
   to drop
   # Bioprosthetic Mitral Valve: Goal INR [**2-27**]. Currrently at goal (INR =
   3.0).
   - continue coumadin
   - continue to trends coags
   # Cholestatic Transaminitis: likely due to hepatic congestion.
   Improving. Benign abdominal exam.
   - continue to trend LFT's
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home atorvastatin

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring, admitted to the hospital with an elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. He has been experiencing difficulties with diuresis and is currently being treated in the ICU for inotrope-assisted diuresis. The patient has several medical complications including acute on chronic systolic heart failure, frequent runs of ventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, microcytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, bioprosthetic mitral valve, cholestatic transaminitis, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's condition involves a worsening of his pre-existing systolic heart failure. This can lead to further fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Frequent runs of ventricular tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which can potentially degenerate into a life-threatening arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation.
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, and uncontrolled rate could contribute to heart failure exacerbation.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's recent baseline creat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring. He was admitted to the ICU for an elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with lasix-driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. The patient initially responded well to inotropic assisted diuresis but developed marked hypokalemia and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He is currently being transferred back to the CCU for intotropic assisted diuresis. 

Potential Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's current condition suggests worsening of his systolic heart failure, leading to volume overload and pulmonary congestion. This can be further complicated by arrhythmias and renal dysfunction.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's serum potassium level is significantly low, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
3. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): The patient's recent episode of NSVT indicates potential cardiac instability and an increased risk of more severe arrhythmias.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate possible acute renal failure, which can be caused by decreased renal perfusion due to low blood pressure and poor forward flow.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels suggest possible hyponat"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo m with hx of sCHF, MVR, and Tricuspid ring, PAF, admitted to [**Hospital1 2259**]
   with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with
   lasix driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. Was initially
   admitted to CCU for ionotrope assisted diuresis but diuresed 7.8 L
   during his ICU stay on lasix gtt alone. Now, having further problems
   with diuresis on the floor and being transferred to the CCU again from
   inotrope-assisted diuresis.
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is in the midst
   of a prolonged hospitalization for acute on chronic systolic heart
   failure. Clinically, he appears volume overloaded, with pitting edema
   in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. Of note, his lungs are
   relatively clear on exam. His most recent echo shows an EF of <20%. His
   current weight is 164.2 lbs, which is up from his self-reported dry
   weight of 135 lbs. He is currently being transferred to the CCU for
   intotrope-assisted diuresis.
   - will increase lasix gtt to see if that improve urine output
   - consider adding milrinone for inotropic support if UOP does not
   improve with lasix
   - consider adding pressors for BP support if necessary
   - continue digoxin to further augment contractility
   - continue metolazone [**Hospital1 **] to help with diuresis
   - continue captopril
   - strict I/O's and daily weights, with goal of maximum diuresis as BP
   will allow
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing, repleting as needed
   - Low sodium diet with 1L fluid restriction
   - no ICD, per patient wishes
   - consider viability study this week to look for any treatable
   ischemia; will d/w with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # Runs of Vtach: Per signout from cardiology floor team, the patient
   has been having frequent runs of Vtach. Of note, the patient has
   expressed that he does not wish to have an ICD, as he requires frequent
   MRI's because of his h/o pancreatic cysts.
   - continue telemetry
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   - Aggressive K repletion
   # Paroxysmal AFib: Patient currently in atrial fibrillation.
   Uncontrolled rate could place a role in HF exacerbation; however, pt
   currently with normal HR. Beta blocker on hold [**2-26**] bradycardia.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - metoprolol on hold, as above
   - digoxin for rate control
   - continue coumadin for INR goal of [**2-27**]
   - repeat ECG
   # Acute Renal Failure: Recent baseline Cr has been ~1.2 to 1.5. Pt
   presented this hospitalization with a Cr of 2.2, likely from poor
   forward flow. With diuresis, the patient's Cr improved to 1.1, now
   increased to 1.6 - poor forward flow vs. ATN.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - will obtain urine lytes

   - diuresis as above
   - fluid restriction as above
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Microcytic Anemia: Per primary team notes, patient with falling Hct
   from admission. Source not clear. Pt has reportedly been guaiac
   negative. Hct recently has been stable.
   - continue to guaiac stools and trend Hct
   - maintain active type and screen
   # Thrombocytopoenia: Stable. Per primary team notes, HIT and ITP ruled
   out; might be due to marrow suppression.
   - continue to trend platelets
   - platelet count not low enough for bleeding complications at this
   point but will be cautious of complications if platelet count continues

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring, admitted to the hospital with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has been experiencing frequent runs of ventricular tachycardia. He also has acute renal failure, hyponatremia, microcytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, bioprosthetic mitral valve, cholestatic transaminitis, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's current weight is 164.2 lbs, which is up from his self-reported dry weight of 135 lbs. He is being transferred to the CCU for intotropic assisted diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. This can lead to further fluid overload, worsening of pulmonary congestion, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has been having frequent runs of ventricular tachycardia. If not controlled, it can lead to hemodynamic instability, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's recent baseline creatinine level was elevated, indicating possible acute renal failure. If not managed appropriately, it can progress to chronic kidney disease and"

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo m with hx of sCHF, MVR, and Tricuspid ring, PAF, admitted to [**Hospital1 2259**]
   with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with
   lasix driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. Was initially
   admitted to CCU for ionotrope assisted diuresis but diuresed 7.8 L
   during his ICU stay on lasix gtt alone. Now, having further problems
   with diuresis on the floor and being transferred to the CCU again from
   inotrope-assisted diuresis.
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is in the midst
   of a prolonged hospitalization for acute on chronic systolic heart
   failure. Clinically, he appears volume overloaded, with pitting edema
   in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. Of note, his lungs are
   relatively clear on exam. His most recent echo shows an EF of <20%. His
   current weight is 157 lbs, which is up from his self-reported dry
   weight of 135 lbs. He is currently being transferred to the CCU for
   intotrope-assisted diuresis.
   - will continue current regimen of 20mg/hr lasix gtt as has had
   favorable response.
   - consider adding milrinone for inotropic support if UOP does not
   improve with lasix
 no need for inotropy thus far
   - consider adding pressors for BP support if necessary
   - continue digoxin to further augment contractility
   - continue metolazone [**Hospital1 **] to help with diuresis
   - continue captopril
   - strict I/O's and daily weights, with goal of maximum diuresis as BP
   will allow
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing, repleting aggressively given ectopy
   - Low sodium diet with 1L fluid restriction
   - no ICD, per patient wishes
   - consider viability study this week to look for any treatable
   ischemia; will d/w with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   - consulting Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to come evaluate the pt today
   # Runs of Vtach: Per signout from cardiology floor team, the patient
   has been having frequent runs of nonsustained Vtach. Of note, the
   patient has expressed that he does not wish to have an ICD, as he
   requires frequent MRI's because of his h/o pancreatic cysts.
   - Monitor telemetry
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   - Aggressive K repletion with IV and PO
   # Paroxysmal AFib: Patient currently in atrial fibrillation.
   Uncontrolled rate could place a role in HF exacerbation; however, pt
   currently with normal HR. Beta blocker on hold [**2-26**] bradycardia.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - metoprolol on hold, as above
   - digoxin for rate control
   - continue coumadin for INR goal of [**2-27**]
   - repeat ECG
   # Acute Renal Failure: Recent baseline Cr has been ~1.2 to 1.5. Pt
   presented this hospitalization with a Cr of 2.2, likely from poor
   forward flow. With diuresis, the patient's Cr improved to 1.1, now
   increased but stable at 1.4 - poor forward flow vs. ATN. FeUrea of 27
   is suggestive of a prerenal etiology, therefore I
d expect improvement
   with diuresis.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Hyponatremia: ? hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting of fluid
   overload.
   - diuresis as above
   - fluid restriction as above
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Microcytic Anemia: Per primary team notes, patient with falling Hct
   from admission. Source not clear. Pt has reportedly been guaiac
   negative. Hct recently has been stable.
   - continue to guaiac stools and trend Hct
   - maintain active type and screen
   # Thrombocytopoenia: Stable. Per primary team notes, HIT and ITP ruled
   out; might be due to marrow suppression.
   - continue to trend platelets
   - platelet count not low enough for bleeding complications at this
   point but will be cautious of complications if platelet count continues
   to drop
   # Bioprosthetic Mitral Valve: Goal INR [**2-27**]. Currrently at goal (INR =
   2.6.
   - continue coumadin
   - continue to trends coags
   # Cholestatic Transaminitis: likely due to hepatic congestion.
   Improving. Benign abdominal exam.
   - continue to trend LFT's
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home atorvastatin
   Diet: Low salt, cardiac heart healthy, fluid restriction
   PIV: PICC, 20 guage.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for inotropic-assisted diuresis due to acute exacerbation of systolic CHF. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia (Vtach), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib), acute renal failure, hyponatremia, microcytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, bioprosthetic mitral valve, cholestatic transaminitis, and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing the regimen of 20mg/hr lasix gtt, considering adding milrinone for inotropic support if the patient's urine output does not improve with lasix, considering adding pressors for blood pressure support if necessary, continuing digoxin to further augment contractility, continuing metolazone, continuing captopril, strict intake/output monitoring with daily weights, goal of maximum diuresis as blood pressure allows, aggressive electrolyte repletion with IV and PO, and low sodium diet with 1L fluid restriction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring, admitted to the hospital with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. He is currently experiencing volume overload, with pitting edema in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. His most recent echo shows an EF of <20%. The patient is being transferred to the CCU for intotrope-assisted diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's current condition of volume overload and elevated JVP suggests worsening heart failure. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance, diuretics, and inotropic support are necessary to prevent further exacerbation.
2. Runs of Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing frequent runs of nonsustained Vtach. Continuous monitoring of telemetry and appropriate antiarrhythmic management should be implemented to prevent any potential complications.
3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation. Rate control is crucial to prevent exacerbation of heart failure. Monitoring on telemetry, digoxin for rate control, and anticoagulation therapy with coumadin are recommended.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's recent baseline creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 1.5, indicating impaired renal function. Close monitoring"

   with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with
   lasix driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. Was initially
   admitted to CCU for ionotrope assisted diuresis but diuresed 7.8 L
   during his ICU stay on lasix gtt alone. Now, having further problems
   with diuresis on the floor and being transferred to the CCU again from
   inotrope-assisted diuresis.
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is in the midst
   of a prolonged hospitalization for acute on chronic systolic heart
   failure. Clinically, he appears volume overloaded, with pitting edema
   in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. Of note, his lungs are
   relatively clear on exam. His most recent echo shows an EF of <20%. His

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid ring, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He is currently experiencing acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure and is being treated with inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 94/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature of 36.7°C.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise, including:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of his chronic systolic heart failure. This can lead to worsening symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and reduced exercise tolerance.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may require further interventions such as the addition of pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient has a low potassium level of 2.8 mEq/L, which needs to be monitored and aggressively repleted due to the risk of ectopy.
4. Frequent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing frequent runs of Vtach, which may require further evaluation and management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring placement, who was admitted to the hospital for an acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for intotrope-assisted diuresis due to persistent hypotension. He has been experiencing frequent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. His current medications include digoxin, metolazone, captopril, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's current condition suggests an acute worsening of his chronic systolic heart failure. This can be indicated by symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and reduced exercise tolerance. Close monitoring and management of his fluid balance, along with optimizing his medication regimen, will be necessary to prevent further exacerbations.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of frequent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia indicates an increased risk for arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring should be maintained to promptly detect and manage any arrhythmias that may arise.

3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have shown fluctuations, suggesting a risk of acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of diuretic therapy will be necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Electrolyte im"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic anemia, pancytopenia, and heart failure, currently admitted to the ICU for inotrope-assisted diuresis. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation and acute renal failure, with hypotension and hyponatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have been fluctuating. The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating a significant fluid loss. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of heart failure and ongoing atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, or worsening heart failure.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed. Additionally, there is a risk of acute kidney injury due to hypotension and fluid imbalances.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's hyponatremia needs to be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications such as seizures or neurological dysfunction. Other electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia or hyponatremia should also be addressed.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

   69 yo m with hx of sCHF, MVR, and Tricuspid ring, PAF, admitted to [**Hospital1 2259**]
   with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with
   lasix driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. Was initially
   admitted to CCU for ionotrope assisted diuresis but diuresed 7.8 L
   during his ICU stay on lasix gtt alone. Now, having further problems
   with diuresis on the floor and being transferred to the CCU again from
   inotrope-assisted diuresis.
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is in the midst
   of a prolonged hospitalization for acute on chronic systolic heart
   failure. Clinically, he still appears in RHF, with pitting edema in the
   lower extremities and elevated JVP, and clear lungs. His most recent
   echo shows an EF of <20%. His current weight is 157 lbs, which is up
   from his self-reported dry weight of 135 lbs.
   - will continue current regimen of 20mg/hr lasix gtt as has had
   favorable response.
   - consider adding milrinone for inotropic support if UOP does not
   improve with lasix
 no need for inotropy thus far
   - consider adding pressors for BP support if necessary
   - continue digoxin to further augment contractility
   - continue metolazone [**Hospital1 **] to help with diuresis
   - continue captopril
   - strict I/O's and daily weights, with goal of maximum diuresis as BP
   will allow
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing, repleting aggressively given ectopy
   - Low sodium diet with 1L fluid restriction
   - no ICD, per patient wishes
   - consider viability study this week to look for any treatable
   ischemia; will d/w with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   - consulting Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to come evaluate the pt today
   # Runs of Vtach: Per signout from cardiology floor team, the patient
   has been having frequent runs of nonsustained Vtach. Of note, the
   patient has expressed that he does not wish to have an ICD, as he
   requires frequent MRI's because of his h/o pancreatic cysts.
   - Monitor telemetry
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   - Aggressive K repletion with IV and PO
   # Paroxysmal AFib: Patient currently in atrial fibrillation.
   Uncontrolled rate could place a role in HF exacerbation; however, pt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring. He was admitted to the hospital with an elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. The patient underwent ionotrope-assisted diuresis but experienced persistent hypotension. He is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a reduced ejection fraction (<20%). The patient's current weight is 157 lbs, which is above his self-reported dry weight of 135 lbs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening heart failure symptoms, including pitting edema in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. His most recent echo shows an EF of <20%, indicating severe dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension despite diuretic therapy, which may require additional support with inotropes or pressors.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. This could be due to poor forward flow secondary to heart failure.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting of fluid overload. Diuretic therapy and fluid restriction are being implemented to address this.
5. Anemia: The patient has micro"

","The patient's chief complaint is the need for inotrope-assisted diuresis. They have a history of systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring placement, and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for an elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. The patient has been diuresed 7.8 liters during their ICU stay on lasix gtt alone.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications, including atrial fibrillation (AF), acute renal failure, hyponatremia, anemia, pancytopenia, and heart failure (CHF), both systolic and diastolic. These conditions are being managed with various treatments such as lasix, milrinone, digoxin, metolazone, captopril, strict input/output monitoring, and dietary restrictions.

The patient also has a history of ventricular tachycardia (Vtach) and has expressed that they do not wish to have an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). They require frequent MRI's due to their history of pancreatic cysts. Additionally, the patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, uncontrolled rate, and is currently on coumadin for rate control.

The patient's renal function has improved from a baseline creatinine of 1.2-1.5 to 1.4, indicating improvement with diuresis. However,"

   69 yo m with hx of sCHF, MVR, and Tricuspid ring, PAF, admitted to [**Hospital1 2259**]
   with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with
   lasix driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. Was initially
   admitted to CCU for ionotrope assisted diuresis but diuresed 7.8 L
   during his ICU stay on lasix gtt alone. Now, having further problems
   with diuresis on the floor and being transferred to the CCU again from
   inotrope-assisted diuresis.
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is in the midst
   of a prolonged hospitalization for acute on chronic systolic heart
   failure. Clinically, he still appears in RHF, with pitting edema in the
   lower extremities and elevated JVP, and clear lungs. His most recent
   echo shows an EF of <20%. His current weight is 157 lbs, which is up
   from his self-reported dry weight of 135 lbs.
   - will continue current regimen of 20mg/hr lasix gtt as has had
   favorable response.
   - consider adding milrinone for inotropic support if UOP does not
   improve with lasix
 no need for inotropy thus far
   - consider adding pressors for BP support if necessary
   - continue digoxin to further augment contractility
   - continue metolazone [**Hospital1 **] to help with diuresis
   - continue captopril
   - strict I/O's and daily weights, with goal of maximum diuresis as BP
   will allow
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing, repleting aggressively given ectopy
   - Low sodium diet with 1L fluid restriction
   - no ICD, per patient wishes

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently experiencing acute exacerbations of systolic heart failure and has been admitted to the CCU for ionotrope-assisted diuresis. The patient has undergone 7.8 L of diuresis during his ICU stay on lasix alone. He also has chronic anemia, pancytopenia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and renal failure. The patient's current weight is 157 lbs, which is up from his self-reported dry weight of 135 lbs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's clinical presentation suggests ongoing heart failure with signs of right heart failure (RHF), including pitting edema in the lower extremities and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). His most recent echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 20%. This indicates severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function, which can lead to further exacerbations of heart failure and potential complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient is currently in AFib, an irregular heart rhythm that increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. Uncontrolled rate in AFib could also contribute to heart failure exacerbations. Rate control measures"
