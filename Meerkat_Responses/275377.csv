","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old lady with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer who presented with shortness of breath and low blood pressure. She was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, which resulted in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures. She is currently hemodynamically stable with Swan-Ganz and arterial line catheters in place. The patient also has pneumonia, pain control issues, and a pleural effusion that may be malignant. She has been intubated due to agitation and increased work of breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's condition could worsen if there is re-accumulation of fluid in the pericardium or if the underlying cause of the effusion, such as cancer, progresses.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's lung infection could lead to worsening respiratory distress or the development of sepsis.
3. Pleural effusion: If the effusion is malignant, it may continue to accumulate, causing respiratory compromise or further complications.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is currently impaired, which could potentially worsen if not properly managed.
5. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient's glycemic control may be affected by her acute illness and medical interventions.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and low blood pressure and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, during which 600cc of bloody fluid was removed, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable after pericardiocentesis, with swan-ganz and arterial line catheters in place. Her cardiac enzymes are negative for acute coronary syndrome, and she has no known history of coronary artery disease or chest pain. Her rhythm remains normal sinus rhythm since admission.

The patient has a right pleural effusion, which may be malignant or due to fluid overload. She also has an uncomplicated urinary tract infection, likely representing an uncomplicated UTI appropriately covered by ceftriaxone for likely pneumonia. She has respiratory distress and was intubated in the cath lab due to agitation and increased work of breathing with concurrent worsening acidosis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's acid-base disturbance is normalizing today with a pH of 7.42. She has anemia, likely due to acute blood loss in the setting of pericardial effusion and drainage. She also has presumed acute renal"

 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Cardiac Tamponade: Large pericardial effusion with tamponade
   physiology, likely malignant in etiology although the broad
   differential includes viral pericarditis given recent cough. Now
   hemodynamically stable s/p pericardiocentesis, with swan-ganz and
   A-line catheters in place.
   -Echo in AM
   -f/u CXR
   -f/u EKG
   -plan to tranfuse 1U pRBC today and recheck post-transfusion Hct
   -Follow pericardial drain output
   -f/u cytology from pericardial fluid
   - plan to remove swan today
   -Monitor hemodynamics on tele
   -Contact PCP and OSH for records
   -Holding home ACE due to hypotension
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
   -cont simvastatin
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM
   RUL opacity: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, which is
   consistent with progressive cough and dyspnea, elevated WBC and
   infiltrate on CXR. Likely a community-acquired pneumonia. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down.
   -CTX and Azithromycin for 14d course
   - sputum cx
   -follow fever curve and symptoms.
   -follow cultures
   -Discuss with PCP/oncologist in AM
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs fluid overload. Elevated BNP suggests
   some element of elevated atrial filling pressures consistent with
   tamponade physiology, but effusion is on the same side as the RUL mass
   and therefore may be malignant. Given tenuous BP in setting of
   pericardial effusion, will hold off on diuresis for now.
   -No diuresis for now
   -Correlate with OSH/[**Hospital 8333**] medical records
   [**Name9 (PRE) 8334**] Is/Os and clinical signs of HF progression
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by CTX for likely PNA.
   -continue antibiotics
   -f/u Ucx
   Respiratory Distress: Intubated in cath lab due to agitation and
   increased work of breathing with concurrent worsening acidosis.
   -Propofol for sedation
   -Will wean as tolerated
   -Consider removing groin lines later today if stable so pt can sit
   upright
   Acid/Base Disturbance: Normalizing today with pH 7.42/31/116. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   -follow ABG
   -adjust vent settings as necessary
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home.
   -transfuse 1U pRBC and recheck Hct
   -follow iron studies

The patient also has pneumonia, likely community-acquired, and is being treated with antibiotics. She has a right pleural effusion that may be malignant or due to fluid overload. Her blood pressure remains tenuous, so diuretics are being held off for now.

She has a urinary tract infection, appropriately covered by the antibiotics she is receiving for pneumonia. Her respiratory distress necessitated intubation in the cath lab due to agitation and increased work of breathing. She is sedated with propofol and will be weaned off the ventilator as tolerated.

Her acid-base disturbance is normalizing, reflecting a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress. She has anemia likely due to acute blood loss during pericardial effusion and drainage, as well as chronic anemia. She will be transfused with packed red blood cells and rechecked for hematocrit levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Cardiac Tamponade: s/p pericardiocentesis. O/N some respiratory
   distress, BPs to 90-100s down from 120-130s, but recovered with
   stimulation. Hemodynamically stable this morning in 90s-100s. No pulsus
   on A-line tracing. Likely not a reaccumulation of pericardial effusion.

   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   -follow ABG
   -adjust vent settings as necessary

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Doctor Last Name 7443**], Harish.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Borderline hypotension overnight.
   Weak with diffuse wheezing.
   ECHO this AM shows no reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
   On antibiotics for postobstructive pneumonia.
   Physical Examination
   Diffuse wheezing.   Very weak.
   Medical Decision Making
   Will ask pulmonary to see re mgmt of postobstructive pneumonia.
   Discuss goals of care and DNR status with pt with nearing endstage lung
   cancer.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

   R1 Addendum:
   We had a discussion with the patient
s husband and daughter around 1pm
   about goals of care.  They were very upset with having seen Mrs. [**Known lastname 8332**]
   intubated, and told us that she has not been healthy for almost six
   years now.  She has not wanted any treatment for her lung cancer and
   has told them before that she did not want any aggressive treatment to
   keep her alive.  They do not want her to be re-intubated if she has
   trouble breathing and do not want CPR or shocks if her heart stops.
   They would like to continue medical management but do not want a
   bronchoscopy if it means having her intubated.  They understand that a
   more
permanent
 peripheral IV could help and would like to try to
   secure a PICC line, but would prefer not to have an invasive IJ or
   sub-clavian line, though they may reconsider.  They would also like to
   avoid an NG-tube if possible.  They are eager to have her closer to
   [**Last Name (un) 5275**], but understand that she will remain at the [**Hospital1 19**] for hospital
   care.  They will try to talk to her some more and we will continue to
   discuss goals of care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and low blood pressure and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis and 600cc of bloody fluid were removed, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures. She experienced some respiratory distress overnight but recovered with stimulation. Her hemodynamics are currently stable, and there is no evidence of reaccumulation of pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially presented with cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, leading to decreased cardiac output. This can result in hypotension and compromised organ perfusion.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress overnight, which may be due to post-obstructive pneumonia or complications from the pericardiocentesis procedure. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Malignant Effusion: The large pericardial effusion is likely of malignant origin, indicating advanced lung cancer. This increases the risk of further malignant effusions and associated complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has evidence of anemia, likely due"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Cardiac Tamponade: Large pericardial effusion with tamponade
   physiology, likely malignant in etiology although the broad
   differential includes viral pericarditis given recent cough. Now
   hemodynamically stable s/p pericardiocentesis, with swan-ganz and
   A-line catheters in place.
   -Echo in AM
   -f/u CXR
   -f/u EKG
   -plan to tranfuse 1U pRBC today and recheck post-transfusion Hct
   -Follow pericardial drain output
   -f/u cytology from pericardial fluid
   - plan to remove swan today
   -Monitor hemodynamics on tele
   -Contact PCP and OSH for records
   -Holding home ACE due to hypotension
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
   -cont simvastatin
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM
   RUL opacity: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, which is
   consistent with progressive cough and dyspnea, elevated WBC and
   infiltrate on CXR. Likely a community-acquired pneumonia. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down.
   -CTX and Azithromycin for 14d course
   - sputum cx
   -follow fever curve and symptoms.
   -follow cultures
   -Discuss with PCP/oncologist in AM
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs fluid overload. Elevated BNP suggests
   some element of elevated atrial filling pressures consistent with
   tamponade physiology, but effusion is on the same side as the RUL mass
   and therefore may be malignant. Given tenuous BP in setting of
   pericardial effusion, will hold off on diuresis for now.
   -No diuresis for now
   -Correlate with OSH/[**Hospital 8333**] medical records
   [**Name9 (PRE) 8334**] Is/Os and clinical signs of HF progression
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by CTX for likely PNA.
   -continue antibiotics
   -f/u Ucx
   Respiratory Distress: Intubated in cath lab due to agitation and
   increased work of breathing with concurrent worsening acidosis.
   -Propofol for sedation
   -Will wean as tolerated
   -Consider removing groin lines later today if stable so pt can sit
   upright
   Acid/Base Disturbance: Normalizing today with pH 7.42/31/116. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.

   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home.

   Presumed ARF: Mild improvement O/N from 1.5 to 1.3. Baseline Cre
   unknown on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given
   hypotension in setting of tamponade. FeNa =0.3, consistent with a

","The patient is an 83-year-old lady with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath and low blood pressure and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc of bloody fluid were removed, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable post-pericardiocentesis, with Swan-Ganz and arterial line catheters in place. She is receiving IV fluids and has been started on antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. Her right pleural effusion is likely due to fluid overload or malignancy.

She has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which suggests elevated atrial filling pressures consistent with tamponade physiology, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the effusion.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with WBCs and bacteria likely representing an uncomplicated UTI, appropriately covered by ceftriaxone for suspected pneumonia.

She is intubated due to agitation and increased work of breathing with concurrent worsening acidosis. She requires sedation with propofol and will be weaned off mechanical ventilation as tolerated.

Her acid-base disturbance is normalizing today with a pH of 7.42/31/116. She has mild acute kidney injury (AKI) with a baseline creatinine unknown on admission but likely due to hypotension in the setting of tamponade.

She also has anemia likely due to acute blood loss in the setting of pericardial effusion and drainage, as well as baseline chronic anemia given her iron pill use at home. She requires a blood transfusion and recheck of hematocrit (Hct).

Her presumed acute renal failure (ARF) is showing mild improvement overnight from 1.5 to 1.3. She has a baseline creatinine unknown on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given hypotension in the setting of tamponade.

She has diabetes mellitus type 2 and will continue with her home basal insulin dose with SSI coverage. Her feeding will be through tube feeds, repleting electrolytes as needed.

The patient has peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, an arterial line, and a central venous line (CVL) with a Swan-Ganz catheter in place. She is receiving various prophylactic measures, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with heparin subcutaneously, pain management with acetaminophen (APAP), and bowel regimen with senna/colace.

The patient is presumed to have full code status and will be discharged to the coronary care unit (CCU) for now. Her healthcare power of attorney is her daughter, who can be contacted at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8336**]."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Cardiac Tamponade: s/p pericardiocentesis. O/N some respiratory
   distress, BPs to 90-100s down from 120-130s, but recovered with
   stimulation. Hemodynamically stable this morning in 90s-100s. No pulsus
   on A-line tracing. Likely not a reaccumulation of pericardial effusion.
   -Hct trending down
 tx goal >21.0
   -f/u cytology from pericardial fluid
   -f/u records from PCP yesterday
   [**Name9 (PRE) 8372**] home ACE due to hypotension
   - Repeat echo today to evaluate for re-accumulation of pericardial
   effusion
   RUL PNA: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, likely CAP. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down. Given respiratory distress o/n, will get
   pulm involved to consider options, e.g. bronchoscopy +/- stenting.
   - day 3 of Levo/Flagyl.
   - f/u again with PCP and family re: goals of care
   - pulm consult
   - sputum cx
   - follow fever curve and symptoms.
   - follow cultures
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs infectious. Given tenuous BP in
   setting of pericardial effusion, will hold off on diuresis for now.
   -f/u pulm rec
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by Levofloxacin for likely PNA.
   -continue antibiotics
   -f/u Ucx
   Respiratory Distress: Extubated, RR 18 this morning w/ strong cough.
   Requiring 95% FiO2 on FM.
   -cont atrovent, start albuterol nebs PRN
   -monitor on tele
   Acid/Base Disturbance: ABG today pH 7.34/41/87/23 on FiO2 95%. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   -follow ABG
   -adjust vent settings as necessary
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home. Hct 21 this morning but re-checked,
   now 23.4
   -trending down, transfusion goal Hct>21.0
   -follow iron studies
   .
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
   -cont simvastatin
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM
   .
   Presumed ARF: Seems to be resolved, Cre now 1.0. Baseline Cre unknown
   on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given
   hypotension in setting of tamponade.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and low blood pressure and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures. 

The patient experienced some respiratory distress overnight, with blood pressures dropping to the 90s-100s from 120-130s, but recovered with stimulation. She is currently hemodynamically stable with blood pressures in the 90s-100s. There is no pulsus paradoxus on the arterial line tracing, suggesting that it is unlikely to be a reaccumulation of pericardial effusion. 

The patient has a right upper lobe pneumonia, which is likely post-obstructive pneumonia, possibly community-acquired pneumonia. She remains afebrile and her white blood cell count is trending down. Given the respiratory distress overnight, a pulmonary consult has been requested to consider options such as bronchoscopy +/- stenting. 

The patient's left pleural effusion is suspected to be either malignant or infectious. Due to her tenuous blood pressure in the setting of pericardial effusion, diuretic therapy has been withheld for now.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Cardiac Tamponade: Large pericardial effusion with tamponade
   physiology, likely malignant in etiology although the broad
   differential includes viral pericarditis given recent cough. O/N some
   respiratory distress, BPs to 90-100s down from 120-130s, but recovered
   with stimulation. Hemodynamically stable this morning. Likely not a
   reaccumulation of pericardial effusion.

   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
   -cont simvastatin
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM
   RUL opacity: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, which is
   consistent with progressive cough and dyspnea, elevated WBC and
   infiltrate on CXR. Likely a community-acquired pneumonia. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down.
   - day 2 of Levo/Flagyl.
   - sputum cx
   - follow fever curve and symptoms.
   - follow cultures
   - f/u again with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Pleural effusion: Malignant vs fluid overload. Given tenuous BP in

   Acid/Base Disturbance: ABG today pH 7.34/41/87. ABG post cath showed pH
   7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and normal PCO2. Given
   hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade, this may reflects a
   resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory alkalosis in the
   setting of respiratory distress.
   -follow ABG
   -adjust vent settings as necessary
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home. Hct 21 this morning but re-checked,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and low blood pressure and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. 

The patient underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures. She experienced some respiratory distress, and her blood pressure fluctuated from 120-130s to 90-100s, but recovered with stimulation. 

The assessment and plan include monitoring for reaccumulation of pericardial effusion, following up on cytology from pericardial fluid, obtaining records from the primary care physician, and contacting home ACE due to hypotension. 

The patient also has right upper lobe opacity, which is likely post-obstructive pneumonia, and there is a suspicion of a pleural effusion that may be malignant or due to fluid overload. Diuretics are being held off for now. 

There is also a mention of urinary tract infection, respiratory distress, acid-base disturbance, anemia, presumed acute renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of various complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old lady with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer who presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis and is now hemodynamically stable with a Swan-Ganz and arterial line catheters in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient had a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to decreased cardiac output and shock.
2. Malignant Pericardial Effusion: The effusion is likely malignant in nature, indicating metastatic spread of lung cancer to the pericardium.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress, possibly due to pneumonia or pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac tamponade.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Cardiac Tamponade: s/p pericardiocentesis. O/N some respiratory
   distress, BPs to 90-100s down from 120-130s, but recovered with
   stimulation. Hemodynamically stable this morning in 90s-100s. No pulsus
   on A-line tracing. Likely not a reaccumulation of pericardial effusion.
   -Hct trending down
 tx goal >21.0
   -f/u cytology from pericardial fluid
   -f/u records from PCP yesterday
   [**Name9 (PRE) 8372**] home ACE due to hypotension
   - Repeat echo today to evaluate for re-accumulation of pericardial
   effusion
   RUL PNA: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, likely CAP. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down. Given respiratory distress o/n, will get
   pulm involved to consider options, e.g. bronchoscopy +/- stenting.
   - day 3 of Levo/Flagyl.
   - f/u again with PCP and family re: goals of care
   - pulm consult
   - sputum cx
   - follow fever curve and symptoms.
   - follow cultures
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs infectious. Given tenuous BP in
   setting of pericardial effusion, will hold off on diuresis for now.
   -f/u pulm rec
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by Levofloxacin for likely PNA.
   -continue antibiotics

   Respiratory Distress: Extubated, RR 18 this morning w/ strong cough.
   Requiring 95% FiO2 on FM.
   -cont atrovent, start albuterol nebs PRN
   -monitor on tele
   Acid/Base Disturbance: ABG today pH 7.34/41/87/23 on FiO2 95%. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   -follow ABG
   -adjust vent settings as necessary
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home. Hct 21 this morning but re-checked,
   now 23.4
   -trending down, transfusion goal Hct>21.0
   -follow iron studies

   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
   -cont simvastatin
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM

   Presumed ARF: Seems to be resolved, Cre now 1.0. Baseline Cre unknown
   on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given
   hypotension in setting of tamponade.

   -renally dose meds
   DM-2: Continue home basal lantus dose with SSI coverage.

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Doctor Last Name 7443**], Harish.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Borderline hypotension overnight.
   Weak with diffuse wheezing.
   ECHO this AM shows no reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
   On antibiotics for postobstructive pneumonia.
   Physical Examination
   Diffuse wheezing.   Very weak.
   Medical Decision Making
   Will ask pulmonary to see re mgmt of postobstructive pneumonia.
   Discuss goals of care and DNR status with pt with nearing endstage lung
   cancer.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and low blood pressure and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, with 600cc of bloody fluid removed. Her systemic and pulmonary pressures normalized following the procedure. The patient experienced some respiratory distress overnight, but recovered with stimulation. Her blood pressure has trended down to the 90s-100s from the 120-130s, but is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, indicating a possible infection. She has a right pleural effusion, which may be malignant or infectious. The patient also has a urinary tract infection, for which she is receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage. She has been extubated and requires supplemental oxygen. Her acid-base disturbance may be resolving lactic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis. The patient's anemia is likely due to acute blood loss and chronic anemia. Her coronary arteries are not significant. Her rhythm has been normal since admission, and she has no known history of arrhythmia. Her renal function has improved. She has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is receiving insulin coverage. She requires prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and pain management. The patient's code status is presumed full, and her disposition is to the CCU."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Cardiac Tamponade: Large pericardial effusion with tamponade
   physiology, likely malignant in etiology although the broad
   differential includes viral pericarditis given recent cough. Now
   hemodynamically stable s/p pericardiocentesis, with swan-ganz and
   A-line catheters in place.
   -Echo in AM
   -f/u CXR
   -f/u EKG
   -plan to tranfuse 1U pRBC today and recheck post-transfusion Hct
   -Follow pericardial drain output
   -f/u cytology from pericardial fluid
   - plan to remove swan today
   -Monitor hemodynamics on tele
   -Contact PCP and OSH for records
   -Holding home ACE due to hypotension
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
   -cont simvastatin
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM
   RUL opacity: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, which is
   consistent with progressive cough and dyspnea, elevated WBC and
   infiltrate on CXR. Likely a community-acquired pneumonia. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down.
   -CTX and Azithromycin for 14d course
   - sputum cx
   -follow fever curve and symptoms.
   -follow cultures
   -Discuss with PCP/oncologist in AM
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs fluid overload. Elevated BNP suggests
   some element of elevated atrial filling pressures consistent with
   tamponade physiology, but effusion is on the same side as the RUL mass
   and therefore may be malignant. Given tenuous BP in setting of
   pericardial effusion, will hold off on diuresis for now.
   -No diuresis for now
   -Correlate with OSH/[**Hospital 8333**] medical records
   [**Name9 (PRE) 8334**] Is/Os and clinical signs of HF progression
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by CTX for likely PNA.
   -continue antibiotics
   -f/u Ucx
   Respiratory Distress: Intubated in cath lab due to agitation and
   increased work of breathing with concurrent worsening acidosis.
   -Propofol for sedation
   -Will wean as tolerated
   -Consider removing groin lines later today if stable so pt can sit
   upright
   Acid/Base Disturbance: Normalizing today with pH 7.42/31/116. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   -follow ABG
   -adjust vent settings as necessary
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home.
   -transfuse 1U pRBC and recheck Hct
   -follow iron studies
   .
   Presumed ARF: Mild improvement O/N from 1.5 to 1.3. Baseline Cre
   unknown on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given
   hypotension in setting of tamponade. FeNa =0.3, consistent with a
   prerenal etiology.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and low blood pressure, and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc of bloody fluid were removed, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures. The patient is now hemodynamically stable post-pericardiocentesis, with swan-ganz and arterial line catheters in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially presented with a large pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.
2. Malignant Pericardial Effusion: Given the patient's history of lung cancer, there is a high likelihood that the pericardial effusion is of malignant origin. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress, leading to endotracheal intubation in the cath lab. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure poses a risk for organ perfusion and may require careful"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Goals of care: Moving towards more comfort driven care.  Hoping to have
   her move to hospice.
   -consult palliative care.
   Cardiac Tamponade: s/p pericardiocentesis. O/N some respiratory
   distress, BPs to 90-100s down from 120-130s, but recovered with
   stimulation. Hemodynamically stable this morning in 90s-100s. No pulsus
   on A-line tracing. Likely not a reaccumulation of pericardial
   effusion.  Cytology from pericardial fluid negative for malignant
   cells.
   -Hct stable for now
 tx goal >21.0
   RUL PNA: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, likely CAP. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down. Given respiratory distress o/n.
   - day 4 of Levo/Flagyl for 10 day course.
   - sputum cx pending
   - follow fever curve and symptoms.
   - follow cultures (Blood pending, urine Ag Legionella neg)
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs infectious. Given tenuous BP in
   setting of pericardial effusion, will hold off on diuresis for now.
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by Levofloxacin for likely PNA.  Cultures came
   back negative.
   -continue antibiotics
   Respiratory Distress: Extubated, RR 18 this morning w/ strong cough.
   Requiring 95% FiO2 on FM.  Most likely pneumonia and tumor burden in
   lungs.
   -cont atrovent, albuterol nebs PRN
   -monitor on tele
   Acid/Base Disturbance: ABG today pH 7.34/41/87/23 on FiO2 95%. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home.
   -stable, transfusion goal Hct>21.0
   .
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
   -cont simvastatin
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM
   .
   Presumed ARF: Seems to be resolved, Cre now 1.0. Baseline Cre unknown
   on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given
   hypotension in setting of tamponade.
   -follow Cre
   DM-2: Continue home basal lantus dose with SSI coverage.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath and low blood pressure, and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis and 600cc of bloody fluid was removed, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures.

The patient's current goals of care are focused on comfort, with the hope of transitioning to hospice care. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient previously experienced cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, compressing the heart and impairing its ability to pump effectively. Although she underwent pericardiocentesis, there is a possibility of recurrence or reaccumulation of the effusion.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains at risk for respiratory distress due to her underlying lung cancer and post-obstructive pneumonia. Given her compromised respiratory function, she may experience further episodes of respiratory distress.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with post-obstructive pneumonia, which is an infection of the lung typically caused by bacteria. This condition can worsen her respiratory status and may require aggressive treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Goals of care: Moving towards more comfort driven care.  Hoping to have
   her move to hospice.
   -consult palliative care.
   Cardiac Tamponade: s/p pericardiocentesis. O/N some respiratory
   distress, BPs to 90-100s down from 120-130s, but recovered with
   stimulation. Hemodynamically stable this morning in 90s-100s. No pulsus
   on A-line tracing. Likely not a reaccumulation of pericardial
   effusion.  Cytology from pericardial fluid negative for malignant
   cells.
   -Hct stable for now
 tx goal >21.0
   RUL PNA: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, likely CAP. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down. Given respiratory distress o/n.
   - day 4 of Levo/Flagyl for 10 day course.
   - sputum cx pending
   - follow fever curve and symptoms.
   - follow cultures (Blood pending, urine Ag Legionella neg)
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs infectious. Given tenuous BP in
   setting of pericardial effusion, will hold off on diuresis for now.
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by Levofloxacin for likely PNA.  Cultures came
   back negative.
   -continue antibiotics
   Respiratory Distress: Extubated, RR 18 this morning w/ strong cough.
   Requiring 95% FiO2 on FM.  Most likely pneumonia and tumor burden in
   lungs.
   -cont atrovent, albuterol nebs PRN
   -monitor on tele
   Acid/Base Disturbance: ABG today pH 7.34/41/87/23 on FiO2 95%. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home.
   -stable, transfusion goal Hct>21.0
   .
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
   -cont simvastatin
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM
   .
   Presumed ARF: Seems to be resolved, Cre now 1.0. Baseline Cre unknown
   on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given
   hypotension in setting of tamponade.
   -follow Cre
   DM-2: Continue home basal lantus dose with SSI coverage.
   .
   FEN: S/S cleared for thickened liquids w/ nurse supervision; replete
   lytes PRN.
   ACCESS: R PIV. No PICC placement necessary if going to facility.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with Heparin SC

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath and low blood pressure, and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in the normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures. 

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient had a previous episode of cardiac tamponade, which was treated with pericardiocentesis. She experienced some respiratory distress overnight but recovered with stimulation. Her hemodynamics are stable, and there is no evidence of reaccumulation of pericardial effusion. Cytology from the pericardial fluid is negative for malignant cells.
2. Right Upper Lobe Pneumonia (RUL PNA): The patient is likely experiencing post-obstructive pneumonia, likely community-acquired pneumonia. She remains afebrile, and her WBC count is trending down. She is on day 4 of Levo/Flagyl for a 10-day course. Sputum culture results are pending.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old lady with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and low blood pressure and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures.

The patient experienced some respiratory distress overnight but recovered with stimulation. Her hemodynamics are stable this morning, and there is no evidence of reaccumulation of pericardial effusion. However, her hematocrit (Hct) is trending down, so the treatment goal is to maintain Hct above 21.0. A follow-up cytology from pericardial fluid is also recommended.

The patient has readmission with likely post-obstructive pneumonia, which is likely community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). She remains afebrile, and her white blood cell count is trending down. Considering her respiratory distress overnight, a pulmonologist will be involved to consider options such as bronchoscopy +/- stenting. She is currently on day 3 of Levo/Flagyl.

The patient also has a right pleural effusion, which is likely malignant versus infectious. Given her tenuous blood pressure in the setting of peric"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer who to OSH with SOB and low BP and found to have a large
   pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant
   etiology, for which she was transferred here for pericardiocentesis. On
   arrival there are few prior hospital records available. She underwent
   pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc of bloody fluid were
   removed resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures.
   Goals of care: Moving towards more comfort driven care.  Hoping to have
   her move to hospice.
   - Per nursing, has been approved to be moved to nh/hospice nearer to
   [**Hospital1 1233**].
   - Occasionally complains of pain at drain site, responds well to
   percocet.  Frequent nausea treated with Zofran and Phenergan.
   Cardiac Tamponade: s/p pericardiocentesis. Occasional respiratory
   distress with coughing, recovers well by calming down. Hemodynamically
   stable this morning in 90s-100s. Cytology from pericardial fluid
   negative for malignant cells.
   RUL PNA: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, likely CAP. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down, remains afebrile.  Sputum culture shows
   rare yeast, but clinical picture does not fit systemic yeast infection.
   - day 5 of Levo/Flagyl for 10 day course.
   - follow fever curve and symptoms.
   - follow cultures (Blood pending, urine Ag Legionella neg, sputum cx
   rare yeast)
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs infectious. Given tenuous
   hemodynamics, will not diurese at this time.
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by Levofloxacin for likely PNA.  Cultures came
   back negative.
   -continue antibiotics
   Respiratory Distress: Extubated, RR 18 this morning w/ strong cough.
   Requiring 95% FiO2 on FM.  Most likely pneumonia and tumor burden in
   lungs. Responds to calming and suctioning
   -cont atrovent, albuterol nebs PRN
   Acid/Base Disturbance: ABG today pH 7.34/41/87/23 on FiO2 95%. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home.  Hct has been stable, today 24.0.
   -stable, transfusion goal Hct>21.0
   .
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.  Off simvastatin given comfort focus
   of care.
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   .
   Presumed ARF: Seems to be resolved, Cre now 1.0. Baseline Cre unknown
   on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given
   hypotension in setting of tamponade.
   -follow Cre
   DM-2: Continue home basal lantus dose with SSI coverage.
   .
   FEN: S/S cleared for thins w/ crushed pills; replete lytes PRN.
   ACCESS: R PIV. No PICC placement as going to hospice.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old lady with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer. She was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and low blood pressure and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and 600cc of bloody fluid were removed, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures.

The goals of care have shifted towards comfort-driven care, and the patient is being considered for transfer to a nursing home/hospice facility near her home. She occasionally complains of pain at the drain site, which responds well to percocet. The patient also experiences frequent nausea, treated with Zofran and Phenergan.

The patient's medical conditions include cardiac tamponade (resolved after pericardiocentesis), right upper lobe pneumonia (likely post-obstructive pneumonia, likely community-acquired pneumonia), right pleural effusion (malignant vs infectious), urinary tract infection (uncomplicated), respiratory distress (extubated, requiring high flow oxygen), and acid-base disturbance (resolving lactic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis).

The patient has anemia (likely due to acute blood loss and chronic anemia), presumed acute kidney injury (resolved), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (managed with basal insulin). She also has a history of presumed atrial"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer. She was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and low blood pressure, and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. The effusion was likely of malignant origin, and she underwent pericardiocentesis to remove 600cc of bloody fluid. This resulted in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures. The patient's goals of care are now focused on comfort, with plans to transfer her to a nursing home/hospice facility near her home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient had a large pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. Although she underwent pericardiocentesis, there is a risk of recurrence or ongoing compression of the heart due to malignant involvement.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient has occasional respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia and tumor burden in the lungs. This may require continued support with nebulizers and close monitoring.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urinary catheter in place, which increases the risk of developing a UTI. The presence of WBCs and bacteria in the urine suggests an uncomplicated UTI, and appropriate antibiotics have been started.

4. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a right-sided pleural effusion, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer s/p RLL resection who p/w to OSH with SOB and low BP and
   found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade,
   likely of malignant etiology, for which she was transferred here for
   pericardiocentesis. On arrival there are few prior hospital records
   available. She underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc
   of bloody fluid were removed resulting in normalization of systemic and
   pulmonary pressures.
   Goals of care: Moving towards more comfort driven care.  Hoping to have
   her move to hospice.
   -consult palliative care.
   Cardiac Tamponade: s/p pericardiocentesis. O/N some respiratory
   distress, BPs to 90-100s down from 120-130s, but recovered with
   stimulation. Hemodynamically stable this morning in 90s-100s. No pulsus
   on A-line tracing. Likely not a reaccumulation of pericardial
   effusion.  Cytology from pericardial fluid negative for malignant
   cells.
   -Hct stable for now
 tx goal >21.0
   RUL PNA: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, likely CAP. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down. Given respiratory distress o/n.
   - day 4 of Levo/Flagyl for 10 day course.
   - sputum cx pending
   - follow fever curve and symptoms.
   - follow cultures (Blood pending, urine Ag Legionella neg)
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs infectious. Given tenuous BP in
   setting of pericardial effusion, will hold off on diuresis for now.
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by Levofloxacin for likely PNA.  Cultures came
   back negative.
   -continue antibiotics
   Respiratory Distress: Extubated, RR 18 this morning w/ strong cough.
   Requiring 95% FiO2 on FM.  Most likely pneumonia and tumor burden in
   lungs.
   -cont atrovent, albuterol nebs PRN
   -monitor on tele
   Acid/Base Disturbance: ABG today pH 7.34/41/87/23 on FiO2 95%. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home.
   -stable, transfusion goal Hct>21.0
   .
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.

   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old lady with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and low blood pressure. She was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures.

The patient's goals of care are moving towards more comfort-driven care, with the hope of transferring her to hospice. The patient has multiple medical complications, including cardiac tamponade, respiratory distress, pneumonia, pleural effusion, urinary tract infection, anemia, presumed acute kidney injury, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially presented with cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac compresses the heart and impairs its ability to pump blood effectively. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, which relieved the pressure on the heart and improved her hemodynamics.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress, which may be attributed to pneumonia and tumor burden in the lungs. This can lead to decreased oxygenation and ventilation, resulting in hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The patient requires supplemental oxygen and may require intubation and mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure occurs.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old lady with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia and
   lung cancer who to OSH with SOB and low BP and found to have a large
   pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant
   etiology, for which she was transferred here for pericardiocentesis. On
   arrival there are few prior hospital records available. She underwent
   pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and 600cc of bloody fluid were
   removed resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures.
   Goals of care: Moving towards more comfort driven care.  Hoping to have
   her move to hospice.
   - Per nursing, has been approved to be moved to nh/hospice nearer to
   [**Hospital1 1233**].
   - Occasionally complains of pain at drain site, responds well to
   percocet.  Frequent nausea treated with Zofran and Phenergan.
   Cardiac Tamponade: s/p pericardiocentesis. Occasional respiratory
   distress with coughing, recovers well by calming down. Hemodynamically
   stable this morning in 90s-100s. Cytology from pericardial fluid
   negative for malignant cells.
   RUL PNA: Read as likely post-obstructive pneumonia, likely CAP. Remains
   afebrile, WBC trending down, remains afebrile.  Sputum culture shows
   rare yeast, but clinical picture does not fit systemic yeast infection.
   - day 5 of Levo/Flagyl for 10 day course.
   - follow fever curve and symptoms.
   - follow cultures (Blood pending, urine Ag Legionella neg)
   R Pleural effusion: Malignant vs infectious. Given tenuous
   hemodynamics, will not diurese at this time.
   UTI: U/A with WBCs and bacteria likely represents an uncomplicated UTI,
   appropriately covered by Levofloxacin for likely PNA.  Cultures came
   back negative.
   -continue antibiotics
   Respiratory Distress: Extubated, RR 18 this morning w/ strong cough.
   Requiring 95% FiO2 on FM.  Most likely pneumonia and tumor burden in
   lungs.
   -cont atrovent, albuterol nebs PRN
   Acid/Base Disturbance: ABG today pH 7.34/41/87/23 on FiO2 95%. ABG post
   cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and
   normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade,
   this may reflects a resolving lactic acidosis along with respiratory
   alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
   .
   Anemia: Likely due to acute blood loss in setting of pericardial
   effusion and drainage. Likely also baseline chronic anemia given that
   she was taking iron pills at home.  Hct has been stable, today 24.0.
   -stable, transfusion goal Hct>21.0
   .
   CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
   Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.  Off simvastatin given comfort focus
   of care.
   RHYTHM: NSR since admission, no known h/o arrhythmia.
   -Monitor on tele
   -repeat EKG in AM
   .
   Presumed ARF: Seems to be resolved, Cre now 1.0. Baseline Cre unknown
   on admission, but a component of prerenal ARF is likely given
   hypotension in setting of tamponade.
   -follow Cre
   DM-2: Continue home basal lantus dose with SSI coverage.
   .
   FEN: S/S cleared for thickened liquids w/ nurse supervision; replete
   lytes PRN.
   ACCESS: R PIV. No PICC placement as going to hospice.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with Heparin SC
   -Pain management with APAP
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace

   DISPO: CCU for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old lady with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer. She was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and low blood pressure, and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, likely of malignant etiology. 

The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and 600cc of bloody fluid were removed, resulting in normalization of systemic and pulmonary pressures. The goals of care have shifted towards comfort-driven care, with plans for the patient to be moved to a nursing home/hospice facility near her home.

The patient's current condition includes occasional complaints of pain at the drain site, which responds well to Percocet. She also experiences frequent nausea treated with Zofran and Phenergan. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include cardiac tamponade, right upper lobe pneumonia (RUL PNA), right pleural effusion (malignant vs infectious), urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory distress, acid-base disturbance, anemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmia, acute renal failure (ARF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM-2), fecal incontinence (FEN), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis."
