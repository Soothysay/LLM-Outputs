   There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
   severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is present

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note mentions that the SHEATH - START and SHEATH - STOP procedures were performed on [**2128-2-26**] at 05:51 PM and 07:41 PM, respectively. This suggests that the patient may have had a central venous catheter inserted or manipulated during this time.

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamides), shellfish, and iodine, with an unknown reaction to the latter. The last dose of antibiotics given to the patient is not specified.

The patient is receiving various infusions and other ICU medications, but the specific names and dosages are not provided. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history mentioned.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. However, the specific details of the review of systems are not provided.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 67 bpm with a normal range of 60-69 bpm, blood pressure of 155/55 mmHg (with a previous range of 110/41-196/95 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with an inspiration pattern, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

   #  Syncope
   No further episodes. Syncope in the context of AS is rare, but can
   happen with severe disease. Likely developed AF with unstable rhythm
   and likely loss of
atrial kick

   20s-30s in the context of AF, which with loss of atrial kick may have
   caused drop in CO and cerebral perfusion in setting of vomitting and
   diarrhea.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in 2024. She presents with critical aortic stenosis, as determined by a valve area of 0.68cm2 and a gradient of 25 by catheterization on 12/7. The patient experienced an episode of syncope earlier this morning, which is rare but can occur with severe aortic stenosis. It is likely that she developed atrial fibrillation with an unstable rhythm and loss of atrial kick, leading to a drop in cardiac output and cerebral perfusion.

The patient has also been experiencing chest pain of unclear etiology, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mild acute renal failure. The chest pain may be related to dehydration, stress, or gastrointestinal causes. The patient's renal failure is likely due to dehydration in the setting of poor oral intake, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and antihypertensive medications have been held.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. She is scheduled for aortic valve valvuloplasty today. After the procedure, she will be restarted on carvedilol, lisinopril, and possibly other medications as her condition allows. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status, but will be full"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She presented with an episode of syncope and was found to have critical aortic stenosis, with a valve area of 0.68cm2 and a gradient of 25 by catheterization. She underwent successful valvuloplasty to open up the aortic valve, resulting in an increased valve area to 0.96cm2 and a reduction in the gradient. The patient also has hypertension and is being started on lisinopril and carvedilol for blood pressure control. Other medical issues include chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mild acute kidney injury, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive on the floor after the procedure. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and restart her home medications, including carvedilol and lisinopril, as tolerated. If she becomes hypertensive or tachycardic, consider restarting an antihypertensive medication.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient experienced syncope in the context of aortic stenosis, which can be associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) with an unstable rhythm and loss of atrial kick. Monitor the patient for tachycardia or arrhythmias, and consider restarting carvedilol first, followed by other medications as"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She presented with an episode of syncope and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.68cm2 and a gradient of 25 by catheterization on 12-7. The patient underwent successful valvuloplasty, and post-procedure, she was started on lisinopril and carvedilol for hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient had severe aortic stenosis prior to the valvuloplasty. While the procedure improved the valve area, there is still a risk of complications such as recurrent syncope, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death.

2. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive post-procedure and was started on lisinopril and carvedilol. It is important to monitor blood pressure and adjust medications as needed to maintain blood pressure within the target range.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient experienced an episode of syncope that was likely related to atrial fibrillation with unstable rhythm. Monitoring for tachycardia or arrhythmias is important, and the cardiologist may consider a holter monitor for further evaluation.

4. Chest Pain: The patient had chest pain that resolved, but its etiology was unclear. It could be"

","The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease who presented to the ICU with severe aortic stenosis and syncope. She underwent a successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty, resulting in an increased aortic valve area and improved symptoms. However, she experienced hypertension post-procedure, which was managed with medication adjustments.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient had several other medical issues that were addressed. These included chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and acute kidney injury. The chest pain was resolved and its etiology remains unclear. The gastrointestinal symptoms were consistent with viral gastroenteritis, leading to mild hypovolemia. The acute kidney injury was likely secondary to dehydration in the setting of poor oral intake, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The patient's current medications include lisinopril and carvedilol for hypertension, as well as aspirin and a statin for her history of coronary artery disease. She is also on a low-sodium diet and receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure ranging from 155/55 mmHg to 196/95 mmHg, heart rate between 60-69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for a 1+ difference in pulses between her right and left"

   0.68cm2 and gradient of 25 by cath [**12-7**]) who presents from outside
   hospital after an episode of syncope at home earlier this morning.
   .
   # Critical AS
   Pt s/p successful valvuloplasty. Either primarily or indirectly related
   to syncope. Echo confirms successful valvuloplasty. No neurologic
   sequelea noted.
   - Likely call out to floor today vs discharge home
   #  HTN: Hypertensive on floor after procedure.
   - Restarting home meds: Carvedilol 25 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **], Lisinopril 20 mg
   PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]
   - Make sure to check pressures on R arm.
   #  Syncope
   No further episodes. Syncope in the context of AS is rare, but can
   happen with severe disease. Likely developed AF with unstable rhythm
   and likely loss of
atrial kick
. Also tachy-brady syndrome with HR in
   20s-30s in the context of AF, which with loss of atrial kick may have
   caused drop in CO and cerebral perfusion in setting of vomitting and
   diarrhea.
   - Monitor tele for tachycardia or arrythmias
   - Valvuloplasty scheduled for today.
   - F/u with C-[**Doctor First Name 458**] re future AVR
   - Hold carvedilol, lisinopril, and diaril given recent bradycardia and
   hypotension
 restart piece-meal as pressure comes up
 restart
   carvedilol first then others (maybe not lisinopril, depending renal
   function).
   - If becomes hypertensive or tachycardic consider restarting a
   antihypertensive, preferably short acting BB if heart rate allows
   - Avoid nitrates
   .
   #  Chest pain: resolved
   Unclear etiology, pt not a clear historian, but valves are innervated
   and valular pain also, albeit less likely, on differential.  Possibly
   demand ischemia in setting of dehydration, stress. Possibly
   gastrointestinal causes given N/V and diarrhea. Currently, pt in normal
   sinus rhythm without significant ST-T wave changes. Pt ruled out for

","The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She presents with critical aortic stenosis, as evidenced by a valve area of 0.68 cm2 and a gradient of 25 by catheterization on 12/7. She experienced an episode of syncope at home earlier this morning and was brought to the hospital. She underwent successful valvuloplasty, with an increase in aortic valve area from 0.68 cm2 to 0.96 cm2, and mild aortic regurgitation was noted. Her blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits. She has no neurologic sequelae. 

The patient's past medical history includes hypertension, for which she is restarted on carvedilol and lisinopril, with the dosage to be increased gradually. She also has a history of chest pain, which resolved and may be related to valvular pain or demand ischemia. She had symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which resolved and may be consistent with viral gastroenteritis leading to mild hypovolemia. 

The patient's renal function is mildly impaired, possibly due to dehydration in the setting of poor oral intake, vomiting, and diarrhea. She has a history of coronary artery disease and is planned to continue with statin therapy. She also has hyperlipidemia and is advised to continue with statin therapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent successful valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis. She presented with syncope, which is rare in severe aortic stenosis but can occur due to atrial fibrillation and loss of atrial kick. The patient's hypertension post-procedure was managed with lisinopril and carvedilol. She also had chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mild acute renal failure, likely due to dehydration from poor oral intake and gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's condition has improved, and she is expected to be called out to the floor for further management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic stenosis: The patient had critical aortic stenosis, which can lead to syncope, chest pain, and heart failure.
2. Hypertension: The patient experienced hypertension post-valvuloplasty, which required medication management.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient may develop atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias, especially in the setting of valvular disease.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient had mild acute renal failure, possibly due to dehydration and poor renal perfusion.
5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient had symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which could be related to viral gastroenteritis or medication side effects.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD"
