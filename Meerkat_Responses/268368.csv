","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male presenting with shortness of breath (SOB) and wheezing for the past three days. He also has peripheral edema and has gained 5 pounds in the past day. The patient's room air saturation is 77% at home. He was given levofloxacin at [**Hospital3**]. In the emergency room, his oxygen saturation was 83% on room air and he was given ASA, lasix, CTX, and azithromycin. The patient's initial temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. An EKG showed mild ST depressions, although cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), and other medical conditions. Review of systems revealed dyspnea as the most notable symptom. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 96/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) and is receiving non-rebreather oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1159 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with a non-rebreather mask and his ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with complaints of shortness of breath, wheezing, and pulmonary distress. He has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (MI), and hypertension (HTN). The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/63 to 104/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and a temperature of 36.5°C. The patient is on respiratory support with a non-rebreather mask and has been given various medications including levofloxacin, aspirin, lasix, corticosteroids, and azithromycin. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, right lower extremity edema, and mild ST depressions on EKG. Laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, and imaging reveals widespread hazy infiltrates and fluid in the major fissure right.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is critically ill with potential medical complications such as:
1. CHF exacerbation: The presence of crackles in the chest, edema, and hazy infiltrates on imaging suggest fluid overload, which can indicate an exacerbation of the patient's CHF.
2. Infection: The patient has been given antibiotics (levofloxacin and azithromycin), indicating"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and a past medical history (PMH) of congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with three days of dyspnea and found to have pulmonary edema, possible pneumonia, and hypoxemic respiratory distress. An echocardiogram this morning showed a possible acute chordae rupture and acute mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing hypoxemia and requires supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, distended abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Imaging shows moderate pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, and a moderate-sized hiatal hernia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a first-degree AV block, ST depressions in V3 and V4, and early R wave progression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% indicates inadequate oxygenation. This could progress to severe respiratory failure and respiratory arrest if not managed appropriately.
2. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with three days of dyspnea and found to have pulmonary edema and hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient also has a possible acute chordae rupture and mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/56 to 117/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on several medications including Zocor, metoprolol, aspirin, heparin, and Xanax.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels, which can lead to further respiratory complications if not managed properly.
2. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema: The patient has signs of fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can worsen if not treated appropriately.
3. Possible acute mitral valve disease: The patient may have an acute rupture of the chordae tendineae and mitral regurgitation, which can lead to heart failure and other cardiac complications if not addressed.
4. Possible pneumonia: The patient's symptoms could be due to a bacterial or viral infection in the lungs, which needs to"
