   gastric varices and recent presentation for variceal bleed s/p failed
   TIPS returns with hematemesis.
   .
   * UGIB: Patient states his first ever UGIB was about 1 month ago. He
   had OSH EGD with confirmed varices. He presents now with recurrent
   hematemesis with HCT drop from recent baseline of 28 to 18. After
   several units blood overnight HCT has recovered steadily to 27 this
   morning. Bleed was immediately concerning for a recurrent variceal
   bleed in this complicated man with known esophageal and gastric
   varices.
   Now s/p successful TIPS placement
   - Continue octreotide today
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] IV PPI
   - 5d course of ceftriaxone
   - Follow Hct q8hrs today, transfuse Hct>25 or active bleed
   - RUQ u/s to check TIPS 1 week
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * Cirrhosis: Etiology is being worked up in the outpatient setting.
   Most likely hepatitis B related. Patient states he has been seeing Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**].  Per records, Hep B serologies are consistent with cleared
   hepatitis B. He also had prior CMV viral inclusions on biopsies.Workup
   to date includes negative AMA, negative ANCA and negative Alpha 1
   antitrypsin. Ferritin not indicative of hemachromatosis and recent
   ceruloplasmin labs still pending.
   - will check HBV and HCV viral loads as serologies may be falsely
   negative in setting of advanced immunosuppression (pt has AIDS by CD4)
   - f/up ceruloplasmin, A1AT
   - f/up liver recs
   -
   .
   * HIV/AIDS: Contact[**Name (NI) **] patient's outpatient ID physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2956**] to
   verify HAART regimen above. She states he has had recent undetectable
   viral load on current combination of medications. Unclear how patient
   contracted virus, possible sexual contact vs. tattoos. Denies h/o IVDU.
   - continue outpatient HAART with boosted darunavir and lamivudine
   (should be 150mg [**Hospital1 7**] given CrCl)
   - continue dapsone prophylaxis
   .
   * HTN: Well controlled now and normotensive with SBps 110-130s, recent
   low BPs in setting of GIB however

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and cirrhosis who presented for a variceal bleed and underwent successful TIPS placement. He has a history of esophageal and gastric varices and was transfused 2 units of blood overnight. No further bleeding occurred. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and octreotide infusions in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, and he has shown improvement in his hemoglobin levels. Laboratory results indicate ongoing liver dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels. Hepatitis B and C viral loads are pending. The patient's HIV status is well-controlled with HAART therapy, but his hypertension is not currently being treated due to recent bleeding. The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis. He has a code status of full code and will be discussed for disposition on the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent variceal bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and recent presentation for the same. Although he underwent successful TIPS placement, there is still a risk of recurrent bleeding.
2. Hepatitis B and C infection: The patient has hepatitis B and C, and viral loads are pending. If the viral loads are positive, it may indicate ongoing viral replication and potential progression of liver disease.
3. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis and ongoing liver dysfunction as indicated"

   * UGIB: Patient states his first ever UGIB was about 1 month ago. He
   had OSH EGD with confirmed varices. He presents now with recurrent
   hematemesis with HCT drop from recent baseline of 28 to 18. After
   several units blood overnight HCT has recovered steadily to 27 this
   morning. Bleed was immediately concerning for a recurrent variceal
   bleed in this complicated man with known esophageal and gastric
   varices.
   Now s/p successful TIPS placement
   - Continue octreotide today then d/c tomorrow
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] IV PPI
   - 5d course of ceftriaxone
   - Follow Hcts [**Hospital1 7**], transfuse Hct>25 or active bleed
   - RUQ u/s to check TIPS 1 week
   - Liver recs appreciated
   - start back nadolol today as BPs stable now
   .
   * Cirrhosis: Etiology is being worked up in the outpatient setting.
   Most likely hepatitis B related. Patient states he has been seeing Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**].  Per records, Hep B serologies are consistent with cleared
   hepatitis B. He also had prior CMV viral inclusions on biopsies.Workup
   to date includes negative AMA, negative ANCA and negative Alpha 1
   antitrypsin. Ferritin not indicative of hemachromatosis and recent

   viral load on current combination of medications. Unclear how patient
   contracted virus, possible sexual contact vs. tattoos. Denies h/o IVDU.
   - continue outpatient HAART with boosted darunavir and lamivudine
   (should be 150mg [**Hospital1 7**] given CrCl)
   - continue dapsone prophylaxis

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, on HAART therapy, hepatitis B virus infection, and cirrhosis. He has esophageal and gastric varices and recently presented for variceal bleeding. The patient underwent a successful Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) placement. He experienced recurrent hematemesis, but his hematocrit levels have recovered after receiving blood transfusions. The patient continues to receive octreotide, pantoprazole, and ceftriaxone. His vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented. Laboratory results show normal liver function tests, except for elevated PT and PTT. The patient's HIV viral load is undetectable on his current HAART regimen. The etiology of cirrhosis is being worked up in the outpatient setting, with hepatitis B being the most likely cause. The patient also has a history of CMV infection. He is being followed up with HBV and HCV viral load testing, as well as ongoing liver function monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent variceal bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding episodes.
2. Hepatitis B-related complications: The patient has hepatitis B, which can lead to liver cirrhosis and its associated complications.
3. HIV/AIDS-related complications: The patient is immunocompromised"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU for bradycardia and hypotension overnight. The patient has been on HAART therapy for his HIV/AIDS, which has resulted in an undetectable viral load. He also has a history of esophageal and gastric varices, for which he underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient's current condition includes mild expiratory wheezes, a regular S1 S2 III/VI systolic murmur, and ecchymoses on the right lower abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis B-related complications: Given the patient's history of hepatitis B, there is a risk of liver-related complications such as liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma.
2. HIV/AIDS-related complications: As an immunocompromised patient, the patient is at risk for opportunistic infections and other HIV/AIDS-related complications like HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.
3. Cirrhosis-related complications: The patient's cirrhosis increases the risk of complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The presence of a systolic murmur suggests a possible underlying cardiac condition that may require further evaluation and management.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for bradycardia and hypotension. The patient has undergone several interventions including increasing the dose of lamivudine, advancing his diet to clears, and discontinuing nadolol due to its effects on heart rate and blood pressure. The patient's Hct has decreased, and he has been given one unit of packed red blood cells. He is currently on IV pantoprazole, ceftriaxone, and levophed. His vital signs are stable, but his ABG shows some abnormalities. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, and his physical examination is notable for occasional expiratory wheezes, a systolic murmur throughout the precordium, and ecchymoses on the right lower abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The assessment and plan include continued treatment for UGIB, monitoring of Hcts, transfusion if below 25, and follow-up with outpatient ID physician to verify HAART regimen. The patient's HIV/AIDS, cirrhosis, and hepatitis B are being worked up further. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU."

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, cirrhosis, and esophageal and gastric varices who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure for a variceal bleed. He presented with bradycardia and hypotension overnight. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 54 to 76 mmHg systolic and 35 to 46 mmHg diastolic. His heart rate has been consistently low, ranging from 46 to 76 beats per minute. 

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit level, platelet count, and liver enzymes. His electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

The patient's medical history includes a recent TIPS procedure, esophageal and gastric varices, suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and cirrhosis. 

The assessment and plan include holding nadolol due to suspected beta-blocker sensitivity, continuing intravenous fluids, and monitoring the patient's condition closely. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of the patient's hemodynamic status, development of hepatic encephalopathy, worsening liver function, and possible infections. 

Further diagnostic tests and treatments are planned, including checking HBV and HCV viral loads, following up with liver function tests, ruling out other etiologies for cir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and cirrhosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for bradycardia and hypotension. The patient has undergone a TIPS procedure for variceal bleeding and is on HAART therapy for HIV. He has been experiencing poor oral intake, leukocytosis, and a decreased hemoglobin level. He is receiving IV fluids, pressor support, and has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal coagulation parameters. Additional tests are planned to determine the cause of his cirrhosis and monitor his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition occurs due to the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream that are normally removed by the liver.
2. Hepato-renal syndrome: Given the patient's compromised liver function and possible hypoperfusion, there is a risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by acute kidney injury in patients with severe liver disease.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV/AIDS increases the risk of infections. The presence of leukocytosis and recent hypotension raises concern for possible sepsis.
4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient"

   gastric varices s/p TIPS for variceal bleed with bradycardia and
   hypotension overnight.
   # Bradycardia
 overnight dropped to high 30s range and stayed low in
   40-60 range after nadolol. [**Month (only) 51**] be associated with BB sensitivity along
   with poor PO lately as he has associated hypotension as well.  Did not
   require and atropine and slowly resolved.  EKG and presentation
   inconsistent for ACS, recent CEs negative.
   .
   - holding nadolol for now , favor norvasc
   -  continue IVFs gently , given boluses overnight
   .
   # Hypotension:  given recent leukocytosis there was concern for
   infection overnight but no fevers and  lactate 1.5 now, CXR
   unremarkable and no growth on blood cultures now.  He has poor overall
   PO intake as well which may be contributing. Additional medication
   effects from beta blocker also likely played a role.  On pressor
   briefly but this was discontinued.
   -f/up bld/ urine cultures
   -consider diagnostic paracentesis
   -trending WBCs, continue to watch for fevers

   - Follow Hcts [**Hospital1 7**], transfuse Hct>25 or active bleed
   - RUQ u/s to check TIPS 1 week
   - Liver recs appreciated

   # Cirrhosis: Etiology is being worked up in the outpatient setting.
   Most likely hepatitis B related. Patient states he has been seeing Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**].  Per records, Hep B serologies are consistent with cleared
   hepatitis B. He also had prior CMV viral inclusions on biopsies.Workup
   to date includes negative AMA, negative ANCA and negative Alpha 1
   antitrypsin. Ferritin not indicative of hemachromatosis and recent
   ceruloplasmin labs still pending.
   - will check HBV and HCV viral loads as serologies may be falsely
   negative in setting of advanced immunosuppression (pt has AIDS by CD4)
   - f/up ceruloplasmin, A1AT

   viral load on current combination of medications. Unclear how patient
   contracted virus, possible sexual contact vs. tattoos. Denies h/o IVDU.
   - continue outpatient HAART with boosted darunavir and lamivudine
   (should be 150mg [**Hospital1 7**] given CrCl)

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and cirrhosis who presented with esophageal and gastric varices. He underwent a TIPS procedure for variceal bleeding and experienced bradycardia and hypotension overnight. The patient's current condition includes ongoing UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), suspected sepsis, and liver cirrhosis. He has been receiving IV fluids, blood transfusions, and medications such as PPI (proton pump inhibitor), ceftriaxone, and octreotide. The patient's HIV/AIDS is being managed with HAART therapy, and he is also on dapsone prophylaxis. His nutritional intake has been advanced to clears, and he is receiving Ensure shakes. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's low heart rate may be due to the use of beta-blockers like nadolol. This could potentially worsen his hypotension and decrease cardiac output.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be caused by various factors including sepsis, poor oral intake, and medication effects. It is important to monitor for signs of shock and provide appropriate fluid resuscitation and pressor support if needed.
3. UGIB: Despite receiving blood transfusions and octreotide, the patient continues to experience upper"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, cirrhosis, and recent presentation for variceal bleeding. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing recurrent hematemesis and a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. The patient underwent a successful TIPS procedure, received multiple blood transfusions, and is currently on supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent variceal bleeding: Given the patient's history of variceal bleeding and known esophageal and gastric varices, there is a potential risk of further bleeding episodes.
2. Infection: The patient is immunocompromised due to HIV/AIDS, which increases the risk of infections. Prophylactic antibiotics have been given, but monitoring for signs of infection is essential.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: As a result of advanced liver disease, the patient may develop hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.
4. Hepatitis B reactivation: Although the patient has cleared hepatitis B in the past, reactivation can occur, especially in the setting of immunosuppression.
5. Hepatocellular carcinoma: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a potential risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
6. Hypotension and bradycardia: The patient's recent episodes of hypotension and bradycardia, possibly related to nad"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and cirrhosis presenting with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to esophageal and gastric varices. He has undergone a successful Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) placement. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 28 to 18, but has recovered to 27 after receiving several units of blood overnight. He is currently hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure ranging from 110-130 mmHg and a heart rate in the high 40s-low 50s beats per minute. The patient's other vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. He is receiving octreotide, pantoprazole, ceftriaxone, and nadolol. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased platelet count. His liver function tests are abnormal with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. The patient's HIV/AIDS is being managed with a combination of antiretroviral medications, and he is also on dapsone prophylaxis. He has a history of hypertension which is currently well-controlled.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with HIV/AIDS and HBV cirrhosis who underwent a TIPS procedure for recurrent variceal bleeding. He is currently hemodynamically stable without further evidence of bleeding. The patient's medical history includes esophageal and gastric varices, UGIB, cirrhosis, hypoxia, HIV/AIDS, HTN, and an unclear etiology for cirrhosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient had a recent variceal bleed, which is a common complication of esophageal and gastric varices. The TIPS procedure was performed to control the bleeding, but there is a risk of rebleeding or other gastrointestinal bleeding events.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient has HBV-induced cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatic hydrothorax.
3. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels (SpO2: 93%), which may be due to lung infection, respiratory distress, or other respiratory complications.
4. HIV/AIDS: The patient has an advanced HIV infection, making him susceptible to opportunistic infections and immunodeficiency-related complications.
5. HTN: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
6. TIPS procedure:"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with HIV/AIDS on HAART and HBV cirrhosis who underwent a TIPS procedure for recurrent variceal bleeding. He presented with HoTN (high oxygen transport), bradycardia, and abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg, heart rate of 47 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. He is hemodynamically stable without further evidence of bleeding. The patient has a history of smoking and has undergone recent banding for esophageal varices.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of HBV cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as altered mental status or confusion.
2. Hepatoxicity: The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including HAART and PPI, which may have hepatotoxic effects. Monitoring liver function tests is essential to detect any potential liver injury.
3. Infection: Patients with HIV/AIDS are at higher risk for infections, including bacterial infections. The patient's immune system may be compromised, making him more susceptible to infections.
4. Bleeding: Although the patient has stabilized after the TIPS procedure, there is still a risk of rebleeding or development of new bleeding sites due to his"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 64 y/o male with HIV/AIDS on HAART and HBV cirrhosis c/b
   esophageal and gastric varices now s/p TIPS for recurrent variceal
   bleeding. Hemodynmically stable without further evidence of bleeding.
   #. HoTN and bradycardia: Likely [**12-31**] nadolol administration. Now
   resolved. Will follow. Pan cultured.
   - Diagnostic para today to r/o SBP given abdominal pain overnight
   #. UGIB: Most consistent with variceal bleed. S/p recent banding. Now
   resolved with TIPS procedure. Hct stable with appropriate bump after 1
   unit for HoTN.
   - Continue PPI
   #. Cirrhosis: Unclear etiology, but could be due to HBV.
   - Liver consult
   - CTX prophylaxis x 5 days
   - HBV viral loads pending; HCV undectable
   #. Hypoxia: CXR clear. H/o smoking.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat 89-92%
   - IS, OOB to chair
   #. HIV/AIDS
   - Continue outpatient HAART
   - Continue dapsone prophylaxis
   #. HTN
   - Hold antihypertensives in setting of GIB and HoTN overnight
   #. FEN: Nutrition consult for cachexia

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with HIV/AIDS, on HAART, and has HBV cirrhosis. The patient's chief complaint is not explicitly mentioned in the note. However, it can be inferred that the patient has been experiencing complications related to his medical conditions.

The patient underwent a TIPS procedure for recurrent variceal bleeding, which has now resolved. He also had an episode of hypotension (HoTN) and bradycardia, likely due to nadolol administration, but it has since resolved.

The patient's current assessment includes the following potential medical complications:

1. Bradycardia and hypotension: These symptoms occurred after nadolol administration, but resolved after switching to levo overnight and weaning off.

2. Abdominal pain: The patient experienced abdominal pain overnight, and diagnostic paracentesis was performed to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient's symptoms are most consistent with variceal bleeding, which has been resolved with the recent banding procedure and TIPS procedure.

4. Cirrhosis: The etiology of the patient's cirrhosis is unclear, but it could be due to HBV infection. A liver consult has been ordered, along with prophylaxis for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and HBV viral load testing.

5. Hypoxia: The patient has a history"
