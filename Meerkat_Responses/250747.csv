","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and a history of aspiration. He presented to the hospital on [**2127-11-4**] with a C5 fracture after a fall. He was intubated due to respiratory failure, suspected aspiration pneumonia, and left lung whiteout. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and is tolerating CPAP at 5/5. He will undergo a CT scan and spine evaluation before considering extubation.

The patient also has a C5 fracture and potentially lumbar/thoracic spine fracture. Neurosurgery evaluated him at OSH, and he has been placed in a hard collar. An ortho spine consultation has been made, and a CT head, neck, and torso are needed to assess for spinous injury and lung parenchyma for any intrinsic pathology.

The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and has no history of atrial fibrillation per his wife. His medical stress may have contributed to the development of atrial fibrillation. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no changes, and the patient will be monitored for cardiac events. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels will be checked, and consideration will be given to a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

The patient has mild hypernatremia, most likely due to mild dehydration. Elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He was intubated due to respiratory failure and possible aspiration pneumonia. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 119/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP support. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, and plans are underway to address his cervical fracture before considering extubation. The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 8.2 to 9.8 K/uL, and his troponin T levels remain low at 0.02. The patient's medical history includes multiple falls, a history of hiatal hernia, and esophageal strictures requiring dilatations. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and continued antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

2. Cervical Fracture: The patient has a C5 fracture, which may require surgical intervention. Orthopedic consultation is planned to assess the need for further studies and potential surgery.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's history"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of aspiration and is currently on CPAP support. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to the left lung whiteout caused by a possible mucous plug. 

2. Cervical fracture: The patient has a C5 fracture, along with a suspected L5 fracture. He has been evaluated by Neurosurgery and is wearing a hard collar. Ortho/neuro surgery consultation is planned for the morning.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, but his wife denies any prior episodes. Rate control measures are being implemented, and consideration will be given to low-dose beta-blockers depending on the results of certain tests. Anticoagulation is being withheld due to the acute fracture.

4. Mild hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which is likely due to mild dehydration. Gentle IV hydration is planned to address this issue.

5. Borderline creatinine elevation: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Further evaluation and monitoring are required.

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  On CXR RLL PNA, likely secondary to
   aspiration.  Left lung whiteout due to possible mucous plug which has
   improved now after intubation. The patient is on minimal vent settings
   and may be able to extubate however, goals of care are an issue right
   now. The question is whether he would benefit from a trach, since he is
   a high risk of aspiration and is a difficult intubation. His mental
   status is somewhat improved this morning but this may be transient and
   needs to be followed.
   - continue broad coverage abx for aspiration PNA
   -try wean on vent, and discuss w/family if trach vs extubation is
   consistant w/goals of care
   - Sputum Cx, BCx
   - also consider if pt going to OR may not want to extubate today

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to aspiration, a C5-C6 fracture with possible anterior long ligament tear, mild hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of multiple falls. He is currently intubated and on minimal vent settings. There are concerns about his mental status and the need for a tracheostomy due to high risk of aspiration. The patient's goals of care need to be discussed with the family, and further imaging and orthopedic consultation are required. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the current intervention fails to improve his condition or if there is further aspiration.
2. Cervical Fracture: There is a risk of spinal cord injury or compression due to the C5-C6 fracture. Surgical intervention may be necessary to stabilize the fracture.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to complications such as clot formation and potential embolization.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's risk of aspiration pneumonia may increase if he is not properly managed with appropriate airway protection.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition may result in further complications such as weight loss,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and acute respiratory failure. 

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy that revealed significant thickened sputum in the left main bronchus and segmental bronchi. A nasogastric (NG) tube was placed, and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed a c5-c6 fracture and a left transverse process fracture at L2-L3. Orthopedic recommendations included an MRI and switching to an Aspen collar.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include ICU-specific medications for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131-162/70-94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure. He has a history of multiple falls and a hiatal hernia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and the presence of thickened sputum in the left main bronchus suggest the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and infection.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. If left untreated, these clots can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. It is essential to monitor for signs of infection and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat VAP.
4. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility in the ICU can lead to pressure ulcers, which are sores that develop due to prolonged pressure on certain areas of the body. Regular repositioning and proper skin care are crucial to prevent"

","The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia, and is currently intubated on CPAP. The plan is to continue with antibiotics coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient also has a suspected cervical and thoracic spine fracture, evaluated by neurosurgery at OSH. A hard collar has been placed, and orthopedic spine consultation has been done. CT scans of the head, neck, and torso are recommended to assess for any intrinsic pathology.

The patient was in atrial fibrillation but is currently in sinus rhythm. A TSH check, EKG changes, and consideration of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) will be done.

The patient has mild hypernatremia, which is likely due to mild dehydration. Gentle IV hydration is planned. Borderline coronary artery disease is mentioned but no EKG changes were observed. A cardiac evaluation will be considered.

The patient's hypertension is likely related to pain but may resolve after addressing acute issues. A low-dose beta-blocker may be considered.

The patient has a history of esophageal strictures, requiring an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) evaluation. He is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and history of aspiration. He presented to the hospital on [**2127-11-4**] with a C5 fracture after a fall.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may have aspiration pneumonia due to his history of aspiration and current respiratory failure. This is suggested by the presence of significant thickened sputum in the left main bronchus and segmental bronchi. The patient will continue receiving zosyn, and vancomycin and ciprofloxacin will be added to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia. A sputum culture and blood culture are needed.

2. C5 fracture: The patient also has a suspected lumbar/thoracic spine fracture. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient at OSH, and a hard collar was placed. A CT scan of the head, neck, and torso is recommended to assess for spinous injury and lung parenchyma for any intrinsic pathology.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was in atrial fibrillation but is currently in sinus rhythm. His medical stress may have contributed to this condition. A urinalysis and blood culture should be done, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be checked.

4. Mild hyper"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o gentleman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal
   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  On CXR RLL PNA, likely secondary to
   aspiration.  Left lung whiteout due to possible mucous plug which has
   improved now after intubation. The patient is on minimal vent settings
   and may be able to extubate however, goals of care are an issue right
   now. The question is whether he would benefit from a trach, since he is
   a high risk of aspiration and is a difficult intubation. His mental
   status is somewhat improved this morning but this may be transient and
   needs to be followed.
   - continue broad coverage abx for aspiration PNA
   -try wean on vent, and discuss w/family if trach vs extubation is
   consistant w/goals of care
   - Sputum Cx, BCx
   - also consider if pt going to OR may not want to extubate today
   .
   # C5 fracture:  MRI prelim read notes known C5-C6 fractures also
   question of anterior long ligament tear.  No cord compression. Final
   reads on both MRI and CT are pending. Ortho is following, likely to
   offer surgery for cervical fracture.
   - Aspen collar
   - f/u ortho spine
   - f/u final reads on imaging
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  No history of afib per wife.  Currently in
   sinus rhythm.
   - in sinus currently
   .
   # Mild hypernatremia:  Most likely mild dehydration.  With elevated
   BUN/Cr ratio consistent with it.
   - resolved w/IV hydration
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. TTE ? Monday.
   - no EKG changes
   .
   # Hypertension: may be in setting of pain, and worse w/decreased
   sedation. Can use short acting meds if needed to control HTN for now.
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures:  At least 3 dilatations this year per
   outside hospital verbal signout.  Unable to place NG tube or OG tube
   per signout.
   - get [**Hospital 3393**] records on previous procedures and treatments
   - NPO for now given aspiration, possible OR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a right lower lobe pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration. He is currently intubated on minimal sedation and may be able to extubate soon. However, there is a concern about his high risk of aspiration, and the decision regarding tracheostomy or extubation needs to be made considering his goals of care.

2. C5 fracture: The patient has a known C5-C6 fractures with a question of an anterior long ligament tear. There is no cord compression, and orthopedic surgery is likely to offer surgery for the cervical fracture.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but there is no history of atrial fibrillation according to the patient's wife. Monitoring and further evaluation are recommended.

4. Mild hypernatremia: The patient has mild dehydration with an elevated BUN/Cr ratio, which has resolved with IV hydration.

5. Borderline CE at OSH: There were no EKG changes here, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned for Monday.

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o gentleman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal
   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  On CXR RLL PNA, likely secondary to aspiration
   vs. nosocomial.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation. The patient is on minimal vent settings and
   may be able to extubate however, going to OR for Cspine fracture this
   AM. He was a difficult intubation and may benefit with trach placement
   if post-extubation period is difficult. His mental status waxes and
   wanes which may also be a barrier to extubation, although he only
   tolerates low vent settings (5/0) for short periods of time due to
   tachypnea.
   - continue broad coverage abx for aspiration PNA
   - continue to wean as tolerated post-op
   - sedation is off at this time
   - touch base w/thoracic service for trach placement, and discuss goals
   of care w/family
   .
   # C5 fracture:  MRI prelim read notes known C5-C6 fractures also
   question of anterior long ligament tear.  To OR today for C5-C6
   fracture repair. Will touch base with surgery post-op for
   recommendations.
   - Aspen collar for now
   - f/u spine recs
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures, hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. GI service
   was consulted over the weekend and felt PEG placement is not
   appropriate in the state of active illness. Now that the patient is
   post-op and likely to get extubated will touch base with GI (and
   possibly thoracic service) to reassess whether PEG placement is
   possible at this time.
   - get [**Hospital 3393**] records on previous procedures and treatments
   - GI consult today re: PEG
   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Currently in
   atrial flutter, hemodynamically stable.
   - no active issues
   .
   # ?History of multiple fall:
   - PT/OT eval once acute issues are taken care of
   - nutrition recs once established airway is decided upon
   # Mild hypernatremia:  Most likely mild dehydration.  With elevated
   BUN/Cr ratio consistent with it.
   - resolved w/IV hydration
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. TTE ? Monday.
   - no EKG changes
   .
   # Hypertension: may be in setting of pain, and worse w/decreased
   sedation. Consider restarting HTN medications now that sedation is off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia. He is intubated and on minimal ventilator settings, with plans for extubation post-operation for cervical spine fracture repair. The patient also has a history of multiple falls, mild hypernatremia, borderline CE at OSH, hypertension, and altered mental status. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, IV hydration, and prophylactic medications. The patient's family has been consulted regarding goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is further deterioration in lung function or if there are complications related to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cervical Spine Fracture: The patient's cervical spine fracture may lead to complications during surgery or post-operative period, such as neurological deficits or non-union of the fracture.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia may progress and cause further respiratory distress or systemic complications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may result in hemodynamic instability or embolic events if not adequately managed.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a chief complaint of mental status changes. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for spine surgery and has undergone imaging studies including an MR head. The MR head reveals loss of flow void in the right distal vertebral artery, which may indicate slow flow or partial thrombosis. There is also a punctate area of possible restricted diffusion, indicating an acute infarct in the left periventricular region. However, this finding can be too small to be accurately characterized and may otherwise represent an artifact. No surrounding mass effect or edema is noted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration. He presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall and was diagnosed with respiratory failure due to aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia. The patient underwent cervical spine fusion surgery and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of aspiration and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cervical spine fracture: The patient underwent cervical spine fusion surgery. Postoperative complications such as infection, hematoma, or neurological deficits could occur.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias or embolic events.
4. Esophageal strictures: The patient has a history of esophageal strictures. There is a risk of further narrowing or complications related to feeding and hydration.
5. Dehydration: The patient has mild hypernatremia and an elevated BUN/Cr ratio, suggesting possible dehydration. Inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses may contribute to this condition.
6. Falls: The patient has a history of multiple falls. There is a risk of further falls due to immobility or other factors.
7. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o gentleman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal
   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  On CXR RLL PNA, likely secondary to aspiration
   vs. nosocomial.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation. The patient is on minimal vent settings and
   may be able to extubate however, going to OR for Cspine fracture this
   AM. He was a difficult intubation and may benefit with trach placement
   if post-extubation period is difficult. His mental status waxes and
   wanes which may also be a barrier to extubation, although he only
   tolerates low vent settings (5/0) for short periods of time due to
   tachypnea.
   - continue broad coverage abx for aspiration PNA
   - continue to wean as tolerated post-op
   - sedation is off at this time
   - touch base w/thoracic service for trach placement, and discuss goals
   of care w/family
   .
   # C5 fracture:  MRI prelim read notes known C5-C6 fractures also
   question of anterior long ligament tear.  To OR today for C5-C6
   fracture repair. Will touch base with surgery post-op for
   recommendations.
   - Aspen collar for now
   - f/u spine recs
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures, hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. GI service
   was consulted over the weekend and felt PEG placement is not
   appropriate in the state of active illness. Now that the patient is
   post-op and likely to get extubated will touch base with GI (and
   possibly thoracic service) to reassess whether PEG placement is
   possible at this time.
   - get [**Hospital 3393**] records on previous procedures and treatments
   - GI consult today re: PEG
   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Currently in
   atrial flutter, hemodynamically stable.
   - no active issues
   .
   # ?History of multiple fall:
   - PT/OT eval once acute issues are taken care of
   - nutrition recs once established airway is decided upon
   # Mild hypernatremia:  Most likely mild dehydration.  With elevated
   BUN/Cr ratio consistent with it.
   - resolved w/IV hydration
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. TTE ? Monday.
   - no EKG changes
   .
   # Hypertension: may be in setting of pain, and worse w/decreased
   sedation. Consider restarting HTN medications now that sedation is off.
   -monitor SBP
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now; replete lytes prn.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: sc heparin, PPI
   .
   # Access: PIV. Consider PICC placement since he will need IV abx.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration. He presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He has respiratory failure due to aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia, which improved after intubation. The patient underwent cervical spine fusion surgery and may benefit from a tracheostomy placement if the post-extubation period is difficult. His mental status fluctuates, making extubation challenging. He tolerates minimal ventilator settings and may be extubated soon. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued for aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and a significant hiatal hernia, preventing successful placement of an oral gastric or nasogastric tube. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is not recommended in the current state of active illness but may be reassessed after the patient recovers from surgery. The patient is also in atrial flutter, hemodynamically stable, and has mild hypernatremia and borderline creatinine elevation. His blood pressure may be due to pain and decreased sedation, and consideration should be given to restarting hypertension medications. The patient's sodium levels have resolved with IV hydration. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and pantoprazole."

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old male with a chief complaint of bloody emesis. The patient is currently intubated and on minimal sedation. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 119/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of atrial flutter, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, respiratory failure, acute alteration in nutrition, and hematuria. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine and BUN levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for low magnesium level. The patient's imaging studies are not available at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal kidney function may indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or other infections is necessary.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, indicating potential hemodynamic instability. Monitoring for signs of hypotension or shock is important.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's immobil"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o gentleman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal
   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation.  He is doing very well on minimal vent
   settings this morning with minimal secretions. He will likely be ready
   to extubate over the next 24-48hrs, however it is unclear whether or
   not we will move towards trach after this. Today will work on
   continuing to wean off the vent and if ready for extubation, will
   monitor and assess whether he will need further support with trach (in
   which case ideally this could be done in the OR on Friday along w/PEG
   placement).  Also, fluid overload may play a role in terms of
   extubation- will give lasix 20 IV today and monitor.
   - continue cipro, zosyn. Today day 5 of 8 day course.
   - continue to wean as tolerated
   .
   # C5 fracture:  C5-C6 fractures s/p neurosurgery repair.  Aspen collar
   to stay on if patient will be upright and moving, otherwise ok to
   remove. Will leave on for now in case we extubate today.
   - Aspen collar for now
   - f/u any new recs from spine
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. Will have PEG
   placement with thoracic service Friday. Pre-op things to do: AM labs,
   active T&C, ? pre-op EKG. NG was removed yesterday due to small amount
   of emesis yesterday and given that we weren
t using it, it was likely
   causing irritation.
   -          f/u thoracic recs
   -          NPO
   -          Nutrition consult, ? PPN (he has not received nutrition in 5
   days)
   .
   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Hemodynamically
   stable, rate controlled.
   - no active issues
   .
   # ?History of multiple falls:
   - PT/OT eval once acute issues are taken care of
   # Mild hypernatremia:  Most likely mild dehydration.  With elevated
   BUN/Cr ratio consistent with it.
   - resolved w/IV hydration
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. Stable
   -telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension: currently normotensive. Will hold off restarting any
   nodal agents at this time. Reasses prior to d/c.
   -monitor SBP
   .
   # FEN:  PEG Friday, PPN for nutrition, FS 150s; lack of BMs will give
   enema today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He has been treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The left lung whiteout at OSH due to a mucous plug has improved after intubation. He is doing well on minimal vent settings and is expected to be ready for extubation in the next 24-48 hours. It is unclear whether a tracheostomy will be performed after extubation. The patient has been weaned off the ventilator and is showing improvement. Fluid overload may affect the decision for extubation, and Lasix will be given today to address this issue. The patient's current medications include ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, heparin sodium, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The risk of respiratory failure may still exist if the patient does not recover fully or if there is a recurrence of aspiration.
2. C5 Fracture: The patient has a cervical fracture (C5-C6) that was surgically repaired. There is a risk of complications such as non-union, malunion, or neurological deficits if proper care and immobilization are not maintained.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a chief complaint of bloody emesis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has several medical complications and conditions, including hematuria, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/60 mmHg to 163/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, the creatinine level is elevated at 1.0 mg/dL, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, for which she is awaiting a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and possibly a tracheostomy. The patient's nutritional status is altered, and she requires"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o gentleman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal
   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  On CXR RLL PNA, likely secondary to aspiration
   vs. nosocomial.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation. The patient is on minimal vent settings and
   may be able to extubate however, going to OR for Cspine fracture this
   AM. He was a difficult intubation and may benefit with trach placement
   if post-extubation period is difficult. His mental status waxes and
   wanes which may also be a barrier to extubation, although he only
   tolerates low vent settings (5/0) for short periods of time due to
   tachypnea.  B/c of neck fusion and difficulty reintubating, pt not
   current candidate for extubation.  Trach may be a good alternative to
   transitioning respiratory support.
   - continue broad coverage abx for aspiration PNA
   - continue to wean as tolerated post-op
   - sedation is off at this time
   - thoracic service consulted for trach/peg placement
   - discuss goals of care w/family
   .
   # C5 fracture:  MRI prelim read notes known C5-C6 fractures also
   question of anterior long ligament tear.  To OR today for C5-C6
   fracture repair. Ortho spine recs are to cont hard collar ahen upright,
   limit wearing in supine to prevent skin breakdown.
   - Aspen collar for now
   - f/u any new recs from spine
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. GI service
   was consulted over the weekend and felt PEG placement is not
   appropriate in the state of active illness. GI eval
d pt and felt
   complexity of hernia limited placing PEG via scope.  Thoracic onboard
   to eval for trach/peg .
   - strictures related to benign cause per records from [**Hospital3 **]
   - thoracic to see today
   .
   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Hemodynamically
   stable, rate controlled.
   - no active issues
   .
   # ?History of multiple falls:
   - PT/OT eval once acute issues are taken care of
   - nutrition recs once established airway/nutirition is decided upon
   # Mild hypernatremia:  Most likely mild dehydration.  With elevated
   BUN/Cr ratio consistent with it.
   - resolved w/IV hydration
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. TTE ? Monday.
   - no EKG changes

   # Hypertension: may be in setting of pain, and worse w/decreased
   sedation. Consider restarting HTN medications now that sedation is off.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and previous aspiration. He presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure due to aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia, C5 fracture, atrial fibrillation, mild hypernatremia, and hypertension.

The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by the presence of right lower lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray, likely secondary to aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia. The patient was intubated and placed on minimal ventilation settings. The note suggests that the patient may benefit from a tracheostomy placement if the post-extubation period is difficult.

The patient also has a C5 fracture, which will require surgical intervention today. An MRI preliminary read notes known C5-C6 fractures and a question of an anterior long ligament tear. The orthopedic spine recommends continuing hard collar use when upright, limiting wearing in supine position to prevent skin breakdown. The patient is currently wearing an Aspen collar.

The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and hernia, which has prevented successful placement of an orogastric (OG)/nasogastric (NG) tube. The gastroenterology service consulted over the weekend felt that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is not appropriate in the state of active illness. The"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o gentleman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal
   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation.  He is doing very well on minimal vent
   settings this morning with minimal secretions. He will likely be ready
   to extubate over the next 24-48hrs, however it is unclear whether or
   not we will move towards trach after this. Today will work on
   continuing to wean off the vent and if ready for extubation, will
   monitor and assess whether he will need further support with trach (in
   which case ideally this could be done in the OR on Friday along w/PEG
   placement).  Also, fluid overload may play a role in terms of
   extubation- will give lasix 20 IV today and monitor.
   - continue cipro, zosyn. Today day 5 of 8 day course.
   - continue to wean as tolerated
   .
   # C5 fracture:  C5-C6 fractures s/p neurosurgery repair.  Aspen collar
   to stay on if patient will be upright and moving, otherwise ok to
   remove. Will leave on for now in case we extubate today.
   - Aspen collar for now
   - f/u any new recs from spine
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. Will have PEG
   placement with thoracic service Friday. Pre-op things to do: AM labs,
   active T&C, ? pre-op EKG. NG was removed yesterday due to small amount
   of emesis yesterday and given that we weren
t using it, it was likely
   causing irritation.
   -          f/u thoracic recs
   -          NPO
   -          Nutrition consult, ? PPN (he has not received nutrition in 5
   days)
   .
   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Hemodynamically
   stable, rate controlled.
   - no active issues
   .
   # ?History of multiple falls:
   - PT/OT eval once acute issues are taken care of
   # Mild hypernatremia:  Most likely mild dehydration.  With elevated
   BUN/Cr ratio consistent with it.
   - resolved w/IV hydration
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. Stable
   -telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension: currently normotensive. Will hold off restarting any
   nodal agents at this time. Reasses prior to d/c.
   -monitor SBP
   .
   # FEN:  PEG Friday, PPN for nutrition, FS 150s; lack of BMs will give
   enema today.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: sc heparin, PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration. He presented to the hospital on 11/4/2127 with a C5 fracture after a fall. The patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intubated due to respiratory failure caused by a mucous plug in the left lung. He is currently doing well on minimal ventilator settings with minimal secretions. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator and assess whether further support with tracheostomy is needed. Fluid overload may affect extubation decisions, so Lasix will be given today to monitor fluid balance. 

Medical Complications:
1. C5 fracture: The patient has cervical spine fractures that were surgically repaired. An Aspen collar has been placed, and spine follow-up recommendations are pending.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intubated to improve oxygenation. Weaning off the ventilator is ongoing, and potential tracheostomy placement is being considered.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled and hemodynamically stable.
4. Esophageal strictures/hernia: The patient has significant esophageal strictures and a hiatal hernia, preventing successful placement"

   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation.  He is doing very well on minimal vent
   settings this morning with minimal secretions. Pt had successful SBT
   yesterday, but will remain intubated for his PEG surgery tomorrow.
   Comfortable on PSV 5/5 will continue.
   - continue cipro, zosyn. Today day 6 of 8 day course.
   .
   # C5 fracture:  C5-C6 fractures s/p neurosurgery repair.  Aspen collar
   to stay on if patient will be upright and moving, otherwise ok to
   remove.
   - Aspen collar removed while intubated and bed-bound by surgery
   - f/u any new recs from spine
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. Will have PEG
   placement with thoracic service Friday. Pre-op things to do: AM labs,
   active T&C, ? pre-op EKG. NG was removed due to small amount of emesis
   yesterday and given that we weren
t using it, it was likely causing
   irritation.
   -          f/u thoracic recs
   -          NPO
   -          Nutrition consult, ? PPN (he has not received nutrition in 5
   days)
   .
   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Hemodynamically
   stable, rate controlled.
   - no active issues
   .
   # ?History of multiple falls:
   - PT/OT eval once acute issues are taken care of
   # Mild hypernatremia:  Most likely mild dehydration.  With elevated
   BUN/Cr ratio consistent with it.
   - resolved w/IV hydration
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. Stable
   -telemetry

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration. He presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He has been treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intubated due to respiratory failure. The left lung whiteout was due to a mucous plug, which improved after intubation. The patient successfully passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday but will remain intubated for his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) surgery tomorrow. He is comfortable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will continue with minimal settings. The patient also has a history of multiple falls, mild hypernatremia, borderline creatinine elevation, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are any complications during or after the PEG surgery.
2. C5 fracture: The patient may experience complications related to the cervical fracture, such as further neurological deficits or non-union.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to complications like thromboembolism or heart failure.
4. Aspiration: The patient is at risk for recurrent aspiration due to his history of aspiration and esophageal stricture.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition can"

The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 11/12/2127 at 9:40 PM, ciprofloxacin on 11/13/2127 at 10:11 PM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 11/14/2127 at 2:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) since 11/14/2127 at 12:04 AM and fentanyl since 11/14/2127 at 4:00 AM. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (69-91 bpm), blood pressure of 164/74 mmHg (97-164/60-78 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (17-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter. The total fluid intake since 12 AM is 2,371 mL, with 795 mL given intravenously. The total fluid output is 5,780 mL, with 340 mL being blood products. The urine output is also 5,780 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 37, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results of pH ///26. The patient's ventilation rate is 15.8 liters per minute.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 6.6 to 9.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 26.8% to 31.8%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 190 to 292 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.8 to 1.0 mg/dL, troponin T levels below the normal range, glucose levels ranging from 107 to 134 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with hematuria, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), alteration in nutrition, and alteration in mental status. 

In the ICU, the patient is receiving peripheral parenteral nutrition, and glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has two lines: a PICC line inserted on 11/11/2127 at 9:35 AM and a 20-gauge line inserted on 11/13/2127 at 4:47 AM. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being provided."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He was treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The left lung whiteout at OSH due to a mucous plug, which has improved after intubation. Postoperatively, he was maintained on AC and will continue the antibiotic course. The plan is to assist with extubation by giving 40mg IV lasix x1 for diuresis. He has a C5-C6 fractures that underwent neurosurgery repair. An Aspen collar was applied, but it was removed at this time. He also has a history of esophageal strictures/hernia, and despite attempts at repair, a successful G and J tube placement was done, unable to repair the hernia. He is currently on G tube gravity feeding and J tube will start feeds in the morning. No medications will be given through the J tube at this time. He has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, but no history of afib per wife. His rate is controlled and he is hemodynamically stable. Other issues include mild hypernatremia, resolved with IV hydration, borderline CE at OSH with no EKG changes, stable hypertension currently normotensive, and a previous fall resulting in a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, alteration in nutrition, and hematuria. The patient's current medications include sc heparin and PPI. He is currently on ICU care and is being moved towards possible extubation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He was treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent neurosurgery repair for C5-C6 fractures. He has a history of esophageal strictures and hiatal hernia, preventing successful placement of an OG/NG tube. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is scheduled for Friday. The patient has mild hypernatremia, which resolved with IV hydration. He is currently stable, with controlled atrial fibrillation. The patient's hypertension is currently normotensive, and any nodal agents will be reassessed prior to discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, especially since he remains intubated for his upcoming PEG surgery.
2. C5 Fracture: The patient's cervical fracture should be evaluated regularly for any signs of neurological deficits or spinal cord injury.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm should continue to be monitored, and any changes should be promptly addressed.
4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored, considering his recent lack of oral intake and the planned PEG placement.
5. Hematuria: The presence"

   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall now s/p G, J tube placement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation.  Out of the OR he was maintained on AC then
   transitioned to PSV. Plan to wean off PSV, currently on SBT with plans
   for possible extubation when more awake. No recent CXR to assess volume
   status but may need Lasix 40 IV if develops any respiratory distress
   after extubation since no longer has positive pressure.
   - will discontinue cipro, zosyn, vanco after today. Today day 8 of 8
   day course.
   -lasix for diuresis as needed
   -On SBT, plan to extubate
   .
   # C5 fracture:  C5-C6 fractures s/p neurosurgery repair.  Aspen collar
   to stay on if patient will be upright and moving, otherwise ok to
   remove.
   - Aspen collar off at this time; will replace now prior to extubation
   and as needed when more awake
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. S/p OR
   yesterday with successful G and J tube placement, unable to repair
   hernia.
   -          G tube to gravity for now, will start J tube trophic feeds
   at 20cc/hour
   -          NPO
   .
   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Hemodynamically
   stable, rate controlled.
   - no active issues
   .
   # leukocytosis: WBC increased today likely [**12-21**] post-op stress from
   demargination. No fevers. Will CIS, follow WBC trend. Possible sources
   include VAP although resp status improved, UTI with foley in place,
   post op wound infection.
   -          CIS
   -          Trend WBC
   .
   # ?History of multiple falls:
   - PT/OT eval once acute issues are taken care of
   # Mild hyponatremia:  Was most likely dilutional [**12-21**] intraop fluids.
   Hyponatremia improved overnight.
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. Stable
   -telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension: currently normotensive. Will hold off restarting any
   nodal agents at this time and will continue to assess. Was on
   Lisinopril 2.5 [**Hospital1 **], metoprolol 25 daily at home, can restart as BP
   tolerates.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital on 11/4/2127 with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent G and J tube placement. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics. His left lung was initially whiteout due to a mucous plug, which improved after intubation. He is currently on spontaneous ventilation mode (PSV) and is being weaned off sedation. The plan is to extubate the patient when he is more awake.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia and is currently on PSV. There is a concern for possible respiratory distress after extubation, so Lasix 40 IV may be given if needed.

2. C5 Fracture: The patient had a C5-C6 fractures that underwent neurosurgery repair. An Aspen collar was placed to immobilize the neck.

3. Esophageal Stricture/Hernia: The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and a significant hiatal hernia. He underwent G and J tube placement during surgery, but the hernia could not be repaired. The G tube is being used for gravity feeding, and the J tube will be used for trophic feeds.

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided information. However, based on the 24-hour events, the patient received various medications including sedation and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 80 bpm with a range of 65-86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/61 mmHg to 170/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute with a range of 11-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%, and the respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 90.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,654 mL, including 623 mL of parenteral nutrition. The output includes 3,190 mL of urine and 1,240 mL of blood products. There is a negative balance of 617 mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, sodium level of 121 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose level of 134 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated levels of CK, CKMB, troponin-T, ALT, AST, LDH, and lactic acid. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient has multiple medical problems, including hematuria, cervical fracture (without spinal cord injury), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), respiratory failure, acute alteration in nutrition, and alteration in nutrition. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's respiratory failure and AFIB may increase the risk of pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The presence of a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury could lead to complications related to immobility and pressure ulcers. The patient's altered nutrition status may contribute to delayed wound healing and infection risk. The elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, troponin-T) suggest possible myocardial injury or ischemia.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory status, cardiac function, fluid balance, nutrition, and potential complications related to immobility and infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital on [**2127-11-4**] with a C5 fracture after a fall. He was treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intubated due to respiratory failure caused by a mucous plug in his left lung. Post-operatively, he was maintained on assisted ventilation and will continue with planned weaning off sedation and extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there is a recurrence of aspiration or if he develops ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. C5 Fracture: The patient may be at risk for further complications related to the cervical fracture, such as spinal cord injury or non-union of the fracture.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could progress to unstable rhythms or lead to the development of thromboembolic events.
4. Esophageal Stricture/Hernia: The patient may continue to experience difficulties with swallowing and nutrition due to the esophageal stricture and hiatal hernia.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's mild hyponatremia should be monitored closely to prevent worsening or symptomatic manifestations.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed appropriately to"

   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall now s/p G, J tube placement
   and hernia reduction.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation.  Out of the OR he was maintained on AC then
   transitioned to PSV. Plan to wean off PSV, currently on [**6-24**], plan for
   SBP, possible extubation when more awake. At this time will continue
   and finish off antibiotic course.  To assist w/extubation Lasix given
   for diuresis.
   - will discontinue cipro, zosyn. Today day 8 of 8 day course.
   -lasix for diuresis
   -PS and wean off with plan to extubate
   .
   # C5 fracture:  C5-C6 fractures s/p neurosurgery repair.  Aspen collar
   to stay on if patient will be upright and moving, otherwise ok to
   remove.
   - Aspen collar off at this time; will replace if more awake and moving
   around
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. S/p OR this
   AM, successful G and J tube placement, unable to repair hernia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital on 11/4/2127 with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent G, J tube placement and hernia reduction. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. He has been treated for aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics. His left lung initially had whiteout due to a mucous plug, which improved after intubation. The plan is to wean off PSV and possibly extubate the patient when he is more awake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which poses risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to positive pressure ventilation.
2. C5 Fracture: The patient has a C5 fracture that was surgically repaired. There is a risk of non-union or malunion, as well as potential neurological deficits if there is any injury to the spinal cord.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolism.
4. Esophageal Strictures/Hernia: The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and significant hiatal hernia,"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o gentleman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal
   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall now s/p G, J tube placement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation.  Out of the OR he was maintained on AC then
   transitioned to PSV. Plan to wean off PSV, currently on SBT with plans
   for possible extubation when more awake. No recent CXR to assess volume
   status but may need Lasix 40 IV if develops any respiratory distress
   after extubation since no longer has positive pressure.
   - will discontinue cipro, zosyn, vanco after today. Today day 8 of 8
   day course.
   -lasix for diuresis as needed
   -On SBT, plan to extubate
   .
   # C5 fracture:  C5-C6 fractures s/p neurosurgery repair.  Aspen collar
   to stay on if patient will be upright and moving, otherwise ok to
   remove.
   - Aspen collar off at this time; will replace now prior to extubation
   and as needed when more awake
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. S/p OR
   yesterday with successful G and J tube placement, unable to repair
   hernia.
   -          G tube to gravity for now, will start J tube trophic feeds
   at 20cc/hour

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital on 11/4/2127 with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent surgery and had a tracheostomy tube placed.

The patient was initially on mechanical ventilation but was extubated on 11/15/2127. He was receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, which improved after intubation. He was maintained on assisted control (AC) ventilation and then transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The plan was to wean off PSV and perform spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) with the goal of possible extubation.

The patient also has a C5-C6 fracture that underwent neurosurgical repair. He is advised to wear an Aspen collar to stabilize his neck during movement.

The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and hiatal hernia. He underwent an operation to place a gastrojejunal (G-J) tube due to unsuccessful oral gastric (OG/NG) tube placement. The hernia could not be repaired during the operation.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled and hemodynamically stable. There are no active issues with this condition.

There is an increase in white blood cell count, likely due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent surgical repair of the fracture and placement of a G and J tube due to his esophageal strictures/hernia. The patient was intubated initially but has now been extubated. He is currently on noninvasive ventilation and being weaned off positive airway pressure support. There are concerns about continued aspiration as evidenced by ronchorchus breath sounds and minimal cough.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of aspiration and current symptoms suggest ongoing respiratory issues. Close monitoring for any signs of distress or deterioration in oxygenation is necessary.
2. C5 fracture: Although the fracture has been surgically repaired, there is a risk of complications such as nonunion, malunion, or neurological deficits. Regular follow-up with orthopedics is recommended.
3. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient is hemodynamically stable and rate-controlled without medications at the moment. However, careful monitoring for any changes in heart rhythm or symptoms is essential.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Trending the WBC count and obtaining cultures if fever spikes or worsening WBC is advised.
5. Hyponatremia:"

   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall now s/p G, J tube placement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation.  Out of the OR he was maintained on AC then
   transitioned to PSV. Plan to wean off PSV, currently on SBT with plans
   for possible extubation when more awake. No recent CXR to assess volume
   status but may need Lasix 40 IV if develops any respiratory distress
   after extubation since no longer has positive pressure.   Off Abx,
   extubated but ronchorus breath sounds with min cough suggest continued
   aspiration.  Latest CXR suggests aspiration PNA recurrence.  WBC count
   rising with temp 100.8
   - restart Cipro, Vanc, Zosyn
   - will readdress the goals of care with family based on chronic
   aspiration
   - lasix PRN
   - AM CXR

   # C5 fracture:  C5-C6 fractures s/p neurosurgery repair.  Aspen collar
   to stay on if patient will be upright and moving, otherwise ok to
   remove.
   - Ortho spine following
   - Aspen collar on with pt awake and moving
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. S/p OR
   yesterday with successful G and J tube placement, unable to repair
   hernia.
   - G tube to gravity for now, restart J tube feeds at 20cc/hour

   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Hemodynamically
   stable, rate controlled sans meds.  Normotensive.
   - no active issues

   # Leukocytosis: rising WBC increased yesterday, now decreasing with no
   fevers over last 24 hours.
   - Trend WBC
   - pan culture if fever spikes/worsening WBC

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent G and J tube placement but could not be repaired for his hiatal hernia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has near white-out of the left lung on chest X-ray, indicating possible aspiration pneumonia. His respiratory failure has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and he is being weaned off pressure support ventilation (PSV) with plans for possible extubation when more awake. The patient's white blood cell count is rising with a temperature of 100.8, suggesting an infection. He also has leukocytosis with no recent fever, a history of multiple falls, mild hyponatremia, and hypertension that is currently normotensive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to recurrent aspiration pneumonia, especially since he has not fully recovered from the previous episode.
2. C5 Fracture: The patient's cervical fracture may lead to further complications such as spinal cord injury or neurological deficits if not properly managed.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient's AF may progress and cause hemodynamic instability or embolic events if not appropriately managed.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's mild hyponatremia may require careful"

","Summary:
The patient is a 9-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical problems. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and hematuria. The patient's vital signs show fever, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and altered liver function tests. The patient's fluid balance shows a significant loss of fluids. The patient is receiving various medications, including sedatives, pain medication, antibiotics, diuretics, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Nosocomial infection due to invasive procedures and catheters.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure due to hypotension, decreased renal perfusion, and medications.
5. Pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility and pressure on the skin.
6. Pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis due to aspiration of gastric contents while sedated and intubated.

   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which has
   improved after intubation.  Out of the OR he was maintained on AC then
   transitioned to PSV. Plan to wean off PSV, currently on SBT with plans
   for possible extubation when more awake. No recent CXR to assess volume
   status but may need Lasix 40 IV if develops any respiratory distress
   after extubation since no longer has positive pressure.   Off Abx,
   extubated but ronchorus breath sounds with min cough suggest continued
   aspiration
   - off Cipro, Vanc, Zosyn, afebrile overnight, with decrease in WBC
   - will d/w family goals of care (need for trach)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent G and J tube placement but could not repair his hiatal hernia. The patient has been treated for respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and has shown improvement in lung whiteout due to mucous plug. He was intubated but is now extubated and on spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) with plans for possible extubation. The patient's recent lab results indicate leukocytosis, mild hyponatremia, and borderline CEA levels. He has a history of multiple falls and is being evaluated for cervical fracture without spinal cord injury. His current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and lasix. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/50 to 151/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration and acute respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for re-intubation.
2. Cervical Fracture: The patient has a cervical fracture that requires careful management to prevent any complications"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They were intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to failed extubation. The patient has a history of cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure. They are also experiencing hematuria. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 mmHg to 151/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, irregular rhythm, ronchorchus breath sounds, and minimal cough. The patient is unresponsive and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, which are signs of infection. VAP is a potential complication in this case due to the prolonged intubation.
2. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished as indicated by alteration in nutrition. Malnutrition can delay recovery and increase the risk of infections.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's lab results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Dehydration is a possible cause of ARF in this case.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (D"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they require invasive ventilation. The patient has been reintubated, indicating that previous attempts at mechanical ventilation were unsuccessful or inadequate.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), which is slightly elevated, suggesting a possible infection. The heart rate is within normal range at 66 bpm, but the blood pressure is on the lower side at 104/58 mmHg. The respiratory rate is set at 14 breaths per minute with the assistance of the ventilator, and the oxygen saturation level is maintained at 98%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient has atrial fibrillation, as indicated by the heart rhythm reading of AF (Atrial Fibrillation). The patient also has a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 18.3 K/uL, which could suggest an infection. The hemoglobin level is within normal range at 29.9 g/dL, but the platelet count is slightly low at 383 K/uL. The blood glucose level is elevated at 152 mg/dL, indicating a need for glycemic control. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium are within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital on 11/4/2127 with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent G, J tube placement and was treated for aspiration pneumonia (APN) with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's left lung was initially white out on chest X-ray due to a mucous plug, which improved after intubation but re-aspiration occurred after extubation, requiring re-intubation. The latest chest X-ray suggests a recurrence of APN, but no chest X-ray is available today. The patient's white blood cell count rose yesterday with a temperature of 100.8°F, but he is now afebrile with a declining white blood cell count on antibiotics. He is currently on assist-control ventilation (AC) but can be changed to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of repeated aspiration, which increases the risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Cervical Fracture (without spinal cord injury): The patient has a C5 fracture that requires ongoing management and stabilization.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has an ulcer on the anterior neck, indicating impaired skin integrity.
5. Hematuria: The patient has mild hematuria, which may indicate a urinary tract issue.
6. Malnutrition: The patient has alteration in nutrition due to his recent inability to eat orally.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which needs to be monitored and managed.
8. Anemia: The patient has a mild drop in hemoglobin concentration, indicating possible anemia.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required to provide a more comprehensive assessment."

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly gentleman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration who presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent G and J tube placement and was treated for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with broad-spectrum antibiotics. His left lung was whiteout due to a mucous plug, which improved after intubation. He was maintained on assisted control ventilation (AC) then transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The plan was to wean off PSV and possibly extubate when more awake. However, he developed respiratory distress and recurrent aspiration, and his latest chest X-ray suggested recurrent aspiration PNA. His WBC count is rising along with a fever of 100.8°F. He will be restarted on ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Goals of care will be discussed with the family, considering tracheostomy. Lasix will be given as needed, and an AM chest X-ray will be done.

The patient also has a C5-C6 fracture that underwent neurosurgery repair, and he is advised to wear an Aspen collar if upright and moving, otherwise it is okay to remove. He has a history of esophageal strictures/hernia, which required at least three dilatations this year. He underwent an unsuccessful operation to repair the hernia yesterday due to"

The patient has impaired skin integrity, hematuria, a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), alteration in nutrition, and altered mental status. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has been given several medications to manage their conditions.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, their blood pressure is slightly low, heart rate is stable, respiratory rate is normal, and oxygen saturation is good. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and other parameters indicating proper ventilation.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The liver enzymes are normal, as well as the kidney function tests. Other lab results indicate elevated lactate levels and decreased albumin level.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and currently receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. There have been efforts to extubate the patient but failed, resulting in the need for continued mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has atrial fibrillation (irregular rhythm) and minimal cough with ronchorus breath sounds.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.8 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 27.8%, platelet count of 292 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 16.2 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose of 134 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment includes impaired skin integrity, hematuria, cervical fracture (without spinal cord injury), atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure (acute), and alteration in nutrition. The respiratory failure is due to failed extubation and worsening chest x-ray with fevers and leukocytosis. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn, Cipro).

The blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some readings being within normal range and others being slightly elevated. The electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium, are within normal limits.

The patient has multiple medical problems, including impaired skin integrity, hematuria, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is due to failed extubation and subsequent worsening of the patient's condition, including fevers and leukocytosis. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding, and efforts are being made to advance the feeding. Glycemic control is also being monitored and managed.

The patient's disposition remains in the ICU, and the attending physician spent a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and hematuria. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 89. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/67 mmHg to 154/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum cultures should be done to prevent and detect this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or pharmacological prophylaxis should be considered.

3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o gentleman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal
   stricture and history of aspiration presented to [**Hospital3 519**] on
   [**2127-11-4**] with C5 fracture after a fall now s/p G, J tube placement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Treated for aspiration PNA with broad coverage
   antibiotics.  Left lung whiteout at OSH due to mucous plug which had
   improved after intubation then re-aspirated after extubation and
   re-intubated.  Likely will repeatedly aspirate so need to discuss and
   decide on possibility of trach with family.  Latest CXR suggests
   aspiration PNA recurrence but no CXR today.  WBC count had risen
   yesterday with temp 100.8, but now afebrile with declining WBC on abx.
   Currently on AC but can change over to PSV, atttempt SBT
   - restart Cipro, Vanc, Zosyn Day [**12-27**] althouggh may need longer course
   - follow up mini BAL
   - will readdress the goals of care with family based on chronic
   aspiration, consider trach
   - lasix PRN, will attempt to keep even for now
   - AM CXR
   - CIS
   - PSV, possible SBT if tolerates
   .
   # C5 fracture:  C5-C6 fractures s/p neurosurgery repair.  Aspen collar
   to stay on if patient will be upright and moving, otherwise ok to
   remove.
   - Ortho spine following
   - Aspen collar on with pt awake and moving
   .
   # H/o esophageal strictures/hernia:  At least 3 dilatations this year
   per outside hospital verbal signout.  Also has significant hiatal
   hernia which has prevented successful placement of OG/NG. S/p OR with
   successful G and J tube placement, unable to repair hernia.
   - G tube to gravity for now
   -  J tube feeds at 20cc/hour, will increase as tolerated, check
   residuals
   - NPO
   .
   # Atrial fib/flutter:  No history of afib per wife.  Hemodynamically
   stable, rate controlled sans meds.  Normotensive.
   - no active issues
   .
   # Leukocytosis: rising WBC increased yesterday, now decreasing 9 from
   16 with no fevers over last 24 hours.
   - Trend WBC
   - pan culture if fever spikes/worsening WBC
   - continue abx
   .
   # History of multiple falls:
   - PT/OT eval once acute issues are taken care of
   # Mild hyponatremia:  Improved.  Will cont to monitor.
   .
   # Boderline CE at OSH: no EKG changes here. Stable
   -telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension: currently normotensive. Will hold off restarting any
   nodal agents at this time and will continue to assess. Was on
   Lisinopril 2.5 [**Hospital1 **], metoprolol 25 daily at home, can restart as BP
   tolerates.
   -monitor SBP

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and a history of aspiration. The patient presented to the hospital with a cervical fracture after a fall and subsequently underwent gastric and jejunostomy tube placement. 

The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, and their heart rate is stable.

The patient has been receiving intravenous Lasix to improve urine output, which was previously low. They have also been receiving antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro) for a suspected pneumonia, and their fever has resolved along with leukocytosis. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased from 18.3 to 16.2 K/uL.

The patient's creatinine levels have remained stable within the normal range, indicating no significant kidney dysfunction. The patient's electrolyte levels are also within normal limits.

The patient's nutritional status is being managed with a fib"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and altered nutrition. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 100.2°F (37.9°C), heart rate of 81 bpm with an irregular rhythm (atrial fibrillation), blood pressure ranging from 133/69 mmHg to 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on the ventilator. 

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.3 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 9.4 g/dL, normal platelet count (Plt) within the range of 350-383 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 152 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's recent medical events include failed extubation and subsequent reintubation, worsening chest X-ray with fevers and leukocytosis, and ongoing discussions with the family regarding the possibility of tracheostomy. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprof"

","Summary:
The patient is an ICU admission with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They were intubated due to failed extubation caused by mucus plugging and hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 133/69 mmHg to 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. The healthcare team is administering antibiotics as a preventive measure.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising serum creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and ensuring adequate fluid balance is crucial.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and proper skin care are essential to prevent skin breakdown.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or pharmacological intervention may be necessary.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient is susceptible to various nosocomial infections"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He was intubated due to mucus plugging and hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, hematuria, cervical fracture (without spinal cord injury), atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.2°F (37.9°C), heart rate between 66-85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82-145/46-93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 89. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.51, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (PaO2) of 375.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Vancomycin) for potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent gastric and jejunostomy tube placement and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He is receiving antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam) and other ICU medications. His vital signs are stable, but he has had low-grade fevers. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. The patient's recent medical history includes a cervical fracture that was surgically repaired, esophageal strictures/hernia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, anemia, hematuria, and alteration in nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia is a significant concern. It is important to closely monitor his oxygenation and ventilation parameters and adjust the ventilator settings as needed.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular surveillance cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent or manage this"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and previous aspiration episodes. He presented to the hospital with a cervical fracture after a fall and was subsequently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration pneumonia. The patient has undergone surgical repair for the cervical fractures.

Currently, the patient is on day 3 of antibiotic therapy with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro. His fever has resolved, and leukocytosis has improved. The patient is receiving assisted ventilation with a pressure support of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. His respiratory status is stable with an ABG indicating metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's urine output has been fluctuating but has responded to Lasix administration. Fluid balance is positive, and the goal is to maintain an even urine output of 20-30 cc/hr.

The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and hernia, for which G and J tubes have been placed for feeding. The G tube is being fed at gravity, while the J tube is providing nutrition at a goal of 40 cc/hr.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled without medication. His blood pressure is currently within normal"

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the emergency department with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent gastrointestinal tube placement and is currently admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 133/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressures support of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated creatinine (Cr), and slightly low potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-) levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin. His ABG shows metabolic alkalosis, and he is receiving PS 10/5 and 40% FiO2. The plan includes continuing the current antibiotics, readdressing the possibility of tr"

The patient has impaired skin integrity, hematuria, a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), alteration in nutrition, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/79 to 145/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume of 490 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 57.

The physical examination reveals an irregular rhythm, rales in the bilateral lung bases, minimal cough, presence of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube), and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows the patient tracks and responds to voice but does not reliably follow commands.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the ICU with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission and has shown improvement in aeration on chest X-ray. Current antibiotics include Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Ciprofloxacin. Mini BAL cultures are pending, with initial results showing no growth of bacteria but fungal culture pending.

The patient's condition remains stable, with ongoing efforts to wean off the ventilator. Fluid balance is positive overall, with fluctuating urine output that responds to Lasix. The patient's metabolic alkalosis could be due to fluid contraction or gastrointestinal losses through the G-tube.

The patient also has a C5 fracture that has been repaired neurosurgically, and an aspen collar will be maintained if the patient is upright and moving. Ortho spine follow-up is planned.

The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and hernia, with G and J tubes placed for feeding. The G-tube output will be monitored as a potential source of alkalosis, while J-tube feeds will be initiated at 40cc.

The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter is rate-controlled without medications, and he is hemodynamically stable and normotensive. Hypertension management will be reassessed, and previous medications (Lisinop"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a  [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of continued alkalosis. The family meeting decided that a tracheostomy (trach) will be performed, and they need to contact general surgery in the morning. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various antibiotics since admission. 

Infusions include pantoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted below. 

Vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 115/56 mmHg to 158/85 mmHg, heart rate between 68-77 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,480 mL and output of 843 mL, with urine output at 668 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation. ABG results indicate continued alkalosis, worsening in nature, with unclear etiology.

Physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, small ulcer on the anterior neck midline, irregular heart sounds, coarse rhonchorous breath sounds, and a gastrointestinal tube in place. Neurological examination shows alertness, awake, with motor and sensory evaluation intact.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and a previous aspiration pneumonia. He presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall and subsequently developed aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

The patient's current vital signs show a stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. His temperature is within normal range. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His respiratory support indicates that he is in need of assisted ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, coarse rhonchi in the lungs, and a small ulcer on the anterior neck midline near the suture line. His abdominal examination is unremarkable, with no signs of hepatosplenomegaly or fluid wave. The patient has a gastrojejunostomy (G) tube and a jejunostomy (J) tube in place.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's blood chemistry reveals a high bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic alkalosis. The kidney function tests are within normal limits, but there are elevated levels of l"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues. They have respiratory failure due to failed extubation and mucus plugging, resulting in hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has shown improved left-sided aeration on chest X-ray. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which the patient is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has hematuria, a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, and an unclear cause of alkalosis. The patient is planned to undergo tracheostomy consultation and is currently receiving ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if there is another episode of mucus plugging or if there is an infection that affects their lung function.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation. It is important to monitor their clinical improvement and follow-up culture results to prevent and manage this condition.
3. Alkalosis: Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's alkalosis. If left untreated or unmanaged, it could lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. Proper skin care and repositioning should be implemented to prevent further deterioration.
5. Hematuria: The cause of the patient's hematuria needs to be identified and managed appropriately. If it is related to a urinary tract infection or injury, timely intervention is crucial to prevent complications.
6. Cervical Fracture: The patient's cervical fracture without spinal cord injury requires careful management to prevent any complications related to immobility or potential neurological deficits.
7. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's AFIB should be closely monitored, and appropriate management strategies should be implemented to prevent thromboembolic events or cardiac rhythm disturbances."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support system in place. The vital signs indicate a heart rate within normal range, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for impaired skin integrity, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. 

The physical examination shows the patient is intubated, has an irregular rhythm, minimal cough, and trace edema. Neurologically, the patient responds to voice but does not reliably follow commands. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Liver enzymes are within normal range, as well as kidney function tests. Blood glucose levels are also within normal limits. 

The patient has impaired skin integrity, a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure. The nutrition plan includes providing Fibersource HN at a rate of 55 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being monitored, and prophylaxis measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple ongoing medical issues requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration pneumonia. He presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall and was subsequently placed on a G, J tube for feeding. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure from aspiration pneumonia. He is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has leukocytosis which has resolved. His urine output is fluctuating and responds to lasix. The patient is planned for a tracheostomy today. He has a C5-C6 fracture that was surgically repaired, and he is advised to wear an aspen collar if he will be upright and moving. The patient's history of esophageal strictures/hernia is noted, with G and J tubes placed for feeding. His atrial fibrillation/flutter is rate-controlled without medications and he is hemodynamically stable. The patient's hypertension is currently normotensive, and restarting nodal agents will be assessed. His anemia is stable with a hematocrit level of 27%. The patient requires nutritional support and repletion of electrolytes."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has a history of cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and altered nutrition. The patient continues to be on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is receiving supplemental oxygen. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/59 to 144/79 mmHg, respiratory rate between 21-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies include a chest X-ray showing improved left-sided aeration.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, altered nutrition, and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation due to mucus plugging and hypoxemic respiratory distress. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and receiving supplemental oxygen. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, including VAP.
2. Alkalosis: The etiology of the patient's alkalosis is unclear"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is in the ICU due to respiratory failure.
- The patient has ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).
- The patient failed extubation due to mucus plugging and hypoxemic respiratory distress. They are currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and receiving antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient also has an unclear etiology of alkalosis, possibly due to GI losses. Diuretics and bicarbonate are being used for management.
- The patient requires refeeding issues to be addressed by nutrition.
- The patient has a history of a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury and alteration in nutrition.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and requires close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent further deterioration.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation. Regular assessment and prompt treatment are necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.
4. Pressure ulcers: Due to impaired"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and previous aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent gastrostomy (G) and jejunostomy (J) tube placement and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on day 5 of vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. His respiratory failure has improved, and his white blood cell count has resolved. He is tolerating CPAP well. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and his urine output and metabolic alkalosis have improved. He has a history of esophageal strictures and hernia but no current changes. G and J tubes were placed for feeding. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled without medications and is hemodynamically stable. His hypertension is currently controlled, and he may restart his previous medications if tolerated. The patient has stable hemoglobin levels at 26% and is being monitored for anemia. He requires nutrition re-evaluation to address tube feeds and has replete electrolytes as needed. He is NPO prior to surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the tracheostomy procedure is not successful or if there are any post-operative complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure"

The patient's blood gas improving on diamox indicates that there has been some improvement in their respiratory function. It is also mentioned that a tracheostomy will be performed, and the thoracics will contact spine regarding neck extension. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. They have received antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and piperacillin, but no adverse reactions have been reported.

The patient is currently on several medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), which is used to prevent stress ulcers in critically ill patients. Other medications are mentioned as well, but their specific names and purposes are not provided in the given information.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature within the normal range, heart rate is slightly low but within acceptable limits for an ICU patient, blood pressure is slightly low as well, respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 100%.

The patient is receiving hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and nutritional support through an IV line. They have received a total of 2,135 mL of fluids since midnight, with 1,325 mL of that being total output (including urine output of 1,495 mL). 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a set volume (Vt) of 416 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. Their ABG results show a pH of 7.26, indicating respiratory acidosis. Their respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 47, which suggests a high risk of extubation failure.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, decreased platelet count (Plt), and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values are within normal limits or show no significant changes.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, and their neurologic examination is incomplete due to lack of assessment in certain areas.

The patient has multiple medical issues, including ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, hematuria, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), alteration in nutrition, and possibly altered mental status. 

ICU care includes nutrition support through a feeding tube and glycemic control. The patient has a PICC line in place for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

No specific comments or code status are mentioned in the provided information."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and altered nutrition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/47 to 143/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 446 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The respiratory system is being supported with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 47 and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count within normal limits. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT/AST), kidney function tests (creatinine), and electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium). Other lab values such as albumin, lactate, troponin-T, and cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 446 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's respiratory support parameters are within normal limits, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 47, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2 of 90 mmHg.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 63 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 100/47 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,135 mL and a total output of 1,595 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 540 mL. Urine output is 1,495 mL, and the patient has received a total of 1,103 mL of intravenous fluids.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.3 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.2 g/dL, elevated hematocrit (Hct) of 30.2%, and a platelet count (Plt) of 346 K/uL. Blood chemistry reveals elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.1 mg/dL and lactic acid at 1.6 mmol/L. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and alteration in nutrition. The patient's physical examination findings include ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, and hematuria.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and delirium. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory parameters to prevent these complications and ensure optimal care in the ICU."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall.
- The patient underwent gastrostomy (G) and jejunostomy (J) tube placement and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in aeration on chest X-ray.
- The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and he is afebrile.
- The patient's acute respiratory failure has improved, and he is tolerating CPAP well.
- The patient's acute kidney injury has resolved, and his urine output has improved.
- The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and hernia, with no current changes.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter is stable, rate-controlled without medications, and normotensive.
- The patient's hypertension is currently under control, and medications can be restarted if blood pressure allows.
- The patient has stable hemoglobin levels at 26%.
- The patient has impaired skin integrity and ineffective coping.
- The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin and Piperacillin on 11/24/2127 at 06:16 AM.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 123/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should continue to be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration.
2. ARF (Acute Respiratory Failure): Although the patient's respiratory failure has improved, there is still a risk of further complications or deterioration.
3. C5 Fracture: The patient has a cervical fracture, and appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent any spinal cord injury.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are stable at 26%, but regular monitoring is necessary to prevent or manage anemia.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.
6. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is currently under control, regular monitoring is necessary to prevent recurrence.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation should be closely monitored for any changes in heart rhythm or rate.
8. Malnutrition: The patient has altered nutrition due to the inability to take oral intake, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure adequate nutrition.
9. Hematuria: The patient has a history of hematuria, which may require further investigation and management.
10. Cervical Fracture (without spinal cord injury): The patient's cervical fracture should be managed appropriately to prevent complications.
11. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status may continue to be compromised due to the inability to take oral intake.
12. Ineffective Coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms may contribute to overall poor health outcomes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and previous aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent G, J tube placement and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on day 5 of Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Cipro. His respiratory failure has improved, and his leukocytosis has resolved. He is tolerating CPAP well. His acute renal failure has resolved, and his metabolic alkalosis has improved. The patient had neurosurgical repair for C5-C6 fractures. He is wearing an Aspen collar and will have it removed if he is awake and moving. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled without medication, and his blood pressure is stable. His anemia is stable with a hematocrit of 26. The patient is being prepared for surgery and will be NPO after midnight. He has impaired skin integrity and ineffective coping. Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, impaired nutrition, hematuria, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation, and alteration in nutrition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. He underwent neurosurgery repair for his C5-C6 fractures. The patient has been on Vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for his aspiration pneumonia and is now on the last day of antibiotics. His acute respiratory failure has improved, and he has resolved acute kidney injury and metabolic alkalosis. He has a history of esophageal strictures/hernia and has had a G and J tube placed for feeding. The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter is rate-controlled without medication, and his hypertension is currently normotensive. His hemoglobin level is stable at 26%. The patient has impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and impaired nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. Although he has shown improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if he aspirates again.
2. Hematuria: The presence of pinpoint pupils may indicate opioid use or potential opioid overdose, which can cause respiratory depression and decreased level of consciousness. This can potentially lead to catheterization-related trauma or infection.
3. Cervical Fracture (Without Spinal Cord Injury): The patient has a history of a C5 fracture, which has been surgically repaired. There is a risk of non-union or malunion of the fracture, leading to persistent neck pain and limited range of motion.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of AF, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. Anticoagulation therapy may be required to reduce this risk.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has an ulcer on the anterior neck midline, which indicates impaired skin integrity. This can lead to infection or further breakdown of the skin.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired nutrition can increase the risk of delayed wound healing, infections, and compromised immune function.
7. Falls: Given the patient's age and history of falls, there is a high risk of recurrent falls, especially with impaired mobility and sensory deficits.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of esophageal strictures/hernia, and the presence of a G and J tube increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if there is trauma during tube placement or if the tubes become dislodged.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent this complication.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU since admission and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He is receiving various medications including diuretics, antibiotics, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 113/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is also on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to high airway pressures from mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: As the patient is on prolonged antibiotic therapy, there is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridium difficile infection.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization and central venous catheter use.
4. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, especially due to prolonged bed rest.
5. Hematuria: The presence of hematuria indicates a potential urinary tract infection or trauma to the urinary system.
6. Cervical Fracture:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He was intubated, diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, and placed on Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro. His respiratory failure has improved, and he is now afebrile with resolved leukocytosis. He is scheduled for a tracheostomy today. His acute renal failure has resolved, and he is maintaining a urine output of 20-30cc/hr. He has a C5-C6 fracture that underwent neurosurgery repair, and he is advised to wear an aspen collar when upright or moving. The patient also has a history of esophageal strictures/hernia, with G and J tubes placed for feeding. His atrial fibrillation/flutter is rate-controlled without medication and he is hemodynamically stable. His hypertension is currently normotensive, and medications will be restarted as tolerated. He has stable hematocrit levels at 26% and is being monitored for any signs of anemia. The patient's nutrition is being addressed with tube feeds, and he is NPO pending surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has improved, but there is still a risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to his history of aspiration.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal"

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and previous aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent surgery for the fracture and was found to have an aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has completed a course of antibiotics. His respiratory failure has improved, but he still requires mechanical ventilation.

The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) has resolved, with improved urine output and resolution of metabolic alkalosis. His goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 2 liters daily. He will receive lasix 40mg IV today and will be reassessed daily.

The patient also has a C5-C6 fracture that underwent neurosurgical repair, and he is wearing an Aspen collar. He will continue to wear the collar when awake and moving.

The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and hernia, and G and J tubes have been placed for feeding. The G tube is being kept to gravity for now, monitoring output as a potential source for alkalosis. J tube feeds are being given with a goal of 40cc.

The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter is hemodynamically stable, and his heart rate is controlled without medications. He is normotensive and has no active issues. His hypertension is currently under control, and he may restart his previous medications if his blood pressure tolerates.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and previous aspiration pneumonia. He presented to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall and underwent surgical repair. He was found to have acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and was placed on a tracheostomy tube. The patient's acute kidney injury has resolved, and he is now maintaining a negative fluid balance with the help of diuretics. The patient's cervical fracture is stable, and he is wearing an Aspen collar for immobilization. His atrial fibrillation is well-controlled without medication, and his blood pressure is within normal limits. The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level of 26%. He is being fed through a gastrostomy tube, and his electrolytes are being monitored and managed as needed. The patient's skin integrity is compromised due to immobility, and there are concerns about malnutrition. Potential complications include ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, hematuria, cervical fracture (without spinal cord injury), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), respiratory failure, acute alteration in nutrition, and alteration in nutrition. The patient is currently in the ICU for further monitoring and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a chief complaint of ineffective coping. The patient has a history of cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, atrial fibrillation (AFib), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hematuria, alteration in nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient underwent thoracic surgery and had a tracheostomy placed on 11/25/2127. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/56 mmHg to 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's weight has increased from 54.1 kg at admission to 59.2 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,200 mL and a total output of 2,632 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,432 mL. The patient received various medications including furosemide (Lasix), midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, vecuronium, and heparin sodium.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 303 K/uL, elevated glucose levels ranging from 86 mg/dL to 142 mg/dL, and slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ineffective coping
2. Impaired skin integrity
3. Hematuria
4. Cervical fracture (without spinal cord injury)
5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib)
6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
7. Alteration in nutrition

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheterization.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobility.
4. Infection due to impaired immune system function and prolonged hospital stay.
5. Kidney injury due to hypotension and dehydration.
6. Prolonged sedation and delirium due to the use of midazolam (Versed) and vecuronium.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration presenting to the hospital with a C5 fracture after a fall. He underwent neurosurgery repair for the fractures and was admitted to the ICU. The patient had respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, which improved with antibiotics and tracheostomy placement. He also had acute renal failure, which resolved with fluid management and diuretics. The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and hernia, for which G and J tubes were placed for feeding. His atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled without medication, and his blood pressure is currently stable. The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level of 26%. He has impaired skin integrity and ineffective coping. The patient is scheduled for surgery and is NPO (nothing by mouth) for the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had previous respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrence if proper airway management and ventilation are not maintained.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient previously experienced acute renal failure, which resolved with appropriate fluid management and diuretics. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
3. Esophageal Strictures/Hernia: The patient has a history of esophageal strictures and hernia. There is a risk of further complications related"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ineffective ventilation. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since [**2127-11-26**] 08:06 AM. The patient's plan is to go to Hospital 858 for rehabilitation today. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, and Ampicillin, on [**2127-11-25**]. The patient is currently receiving Pantoprazole (Protonix), Furosemide (Lasix), and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) in the ICU. Other medications include Fibersource HN for nutrition and Glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax 37.2 C (99%), Tcurrent 36.9 C (98.4%), HR 62 bpm (57-91), BP 120/66 mmHg (79-147/83-100), RR 15 insp/min (14-25), SpO2 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation with a heart rhythm of AF.

The patient's weight is currently 59.2 kg, an increase from admission weight of 54.1 kg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,427 mL and total output of 2,067 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 640 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with a ventilator mode set to standby. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.31.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic assessment not assessed, and labs/radiology results provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a history of respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure if the ventilatory support is not adequately managed.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not managed properly.
3. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, which could be indicative of a urinary tract infection or other renal complications.
4. Cervical Fracture: The patient has a history of a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury. This may pose a risk of further complications related to the cervical spine.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is impaired, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition status may increase the risk of delayed wound healing, infections, and impaired immune function.
7. Medication Complications: With the patient receiving multiple medications, there is a potential risk of drug interactions, adverse effects, or medication errors.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization and invasive procedures.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP."
