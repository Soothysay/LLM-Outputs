","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, desaturation events, and difficulty breathing. He has been diagnosed with probable viral myocarditis, as evidenced by recent viral illness, mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and absence of gross volume overload. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He is currently on respiratory support with 100% NRB and showing signs of improvement. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent viral illness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac failure: The patient's myocarditis can lead to cardiac failure, characterized by symptoms such as fluid retention, decreased cardiac output, and organ dysfunction.
2. Arrhythmias: Myocarditis can cause arrhythmias, which may include ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or other irregular heart rhythms.
3. Septic shock: Given the patient's fever and leukocytosis, there is a possibility of concurrent bacterial infection leading to septic shock, characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low PaO2 despite being on 100% NRB indicate a risk of respiratory failure if adequate oxygenation cannot be maintained.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's fluid balance shows positive fluid intake and output, but there is a significant difference of 869"

   # Myocarditis/Pericarditis
 Unclear if pt has component of
   pericardiitis in addition to myocarditis given positional nature of
   pain, ? rub on exam today and new ECG changes although ECG findings
   are not typical for pericarditis. Appears acute (and not fulminant) in
   the setting of a recent viral illness. Treatment is largely supportive.
   Has developed volume overload with worsened pulmonary edema and episode
   overnight suggesting more depressed EF than was evident on echo done
   yesterday. He was given gentle IVF which may have triggered acute pulm
   edema episode. Symptoms improved with repositioning and Lasix. Most
   likely etiology viral ([**Location (un) 2636**], vs. HIV vs. CMV/EBV, hep) although
   other considerations include Lyme, bacterial such as strep if concern
   for pancarditis, Chagas since from El [**Country 2613**], other viral ex. MMR,
   rheumatic (although clinically does not fit this picture and no other
   findings c/w rheumatological disease.  TB also consideration although
   he denies known TB contacts.
   -- monitor on telemetry
   -- trend CE's daily to assess for ongoing myocardial necrosis, CKs
   trending down
   -- daily EKGs
   -- Follow daily CXR to eval pulmonary vascular overload. Will give
   Lasix IV 40 this am given CXR clinical exam
   -- repeat echo given clinical picture of worsening heart failure and
   echo which only showed mildly depressed EF however may have component
   oif diastolic dysfxn as well

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain. He has been admitted to the ICU due to elevated cardiac enzymes following a viral illness, suggestive of myocarditis/pericarditis. The patient has developed volume overload with worsened pulmonary edema and an episode of acute pulmonary edema overnight. He was given gentle IV fluids, which may have triggered the episode. Symptoms improved with repositioning and Lasix. The most likely etiology is viral, but other considerations include Lyme disease, bacterial infection such as strep, Chagas disease, other viral infections like MMR or rheumatic fever, and tuberculosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocarditis/Pericarditis: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and recent viral illness indicate myocarditis/pericarditis. This condition can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and potentially cardiogenic shock.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has shown signs of worsening pulmonary edema, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly. This may require further interventions such as diuretics and position changes.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is being treated with Cipro for a possible UTI. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to worsening infection and sepsis.
4. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, which may be related to his ongoing acute illness. If not properly managed"

 Unclear if pt has component of

   pain, ? rub on exam today and new ECG changes although ECG findings
   are not typical for pericarditis. Appears acute (and not fulminant) in
   the setting of a recent viral illness. Treatment is largely supportive.
   Has developed volume overload with worsened pulmonary edema and episode
   overnight suggesting more depressed EF than was evident on echo done
   yesterday. He was given gentle IVF which may have triggered acute pulm
   edema episode. Symptoms improved with repositioning and Lasix. Most
   likely etiology viral ([**Location (un) 2636**], vs. HIV vs. CMV/EBV, hep) although
   other considerations include Lyme, bacterial such as strep if concern
   for pancarditis, Chagas since from El [**Country 2613**], other viral ex. MMR,
   rheumatic (although clinically does not fit this picture and no other
   findings c/w rheumatological disease.  TB also consideration although

s note and agree with the
   findings and plan of care. I would add that the patient
s desaturation
   last night, and improvement with lasix suggested CHF, which is present
   on CXR.  This would suggest an LVEF lower than the 50% seen on
   yesterday
s echo.  The presumed dx is a myocarditis, possibly viral.
   Though echo shows no pericardial effusion his positional chest pain and
   his precordial exam do suggest possible pericarditis.  We will ask
   Cardiology to follow the patient with us, and advise regarding further
   cardiac studies and whether it is better to push diuresis or afterload
   reduction.   The patient had NSVT last night and has rising troponin
   and evolving EKG, so he needs to remain in the CCU with monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes following a viral illness. The patient has been diagnosed with myocarditis, possibly viral in origin. His condition is complicated by volume overload and pulmonary edema, for which he has been given Lasix. The patient's troponin levels are rising, and he experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening heart failure and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
2. Arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or complete heart block, given the NSVT episode and rising troponin levels.
3. Respiratory failure due to severe pulmonary edema and difficulty breathing.
4. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal function due to dehydration and potential use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Infection, including urinary tract infection (UTI) and possible pneumonia, indicated by leukocytosis and pending sputum culture.
6. Hepatic dysfunction, suggested by elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT).
7. Electrolyte imbalances, specifically hyponatremia and hypokalemia, which require close monitoring and correction.

It is important to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status, respiratory function, renal function, liver enzymes, electrolyte levels, and infection parameters. Timely intervention and appropriate"
