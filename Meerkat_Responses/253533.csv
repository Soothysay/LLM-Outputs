   # Cryptococcal Meningitis
  recurrent infx
 has been on ambisone and
   attempted to start flucytosine but not tolerating orally.
   - s/p lumbar drain; refusing MRI
   - goal drain pressure <25mmHg
   - Lumbar drain on continuous drainage for now
   - daily CSF to be sent for WBC, glucose, protein
   - continue ambisome and attempt to give flucytosine
   - ID is following, appreciate recommendations
   - repeat cryptococcal antigen titer is pending
   - neurosurgery recs, pt may need VP shunt if drain dose not work
   - continue to discuss MRI brain with pt to r/o further infection
   (consider possible elective intubation for MRI)
   - may need ophtho consult if pressures remain elevated per neuro recs
   - continue ambisome, vanco, and flucytosine
   #Leukocytosis
   -pt
s WBC is rising
   - was diaphoretic last night
 blood cx drawn
   - will follow

   # Diarrhea: having continuous diarrhea, unclear cause. C. Diff x 1
   negative
   - recheck c. diff
   - continue flagyl treatment
   .
   # N/V: likely from increased ICP.
   - clears, advance as tolerated
   - drain to reduce ICP
   .
   # Delerium: Likely secondary to menigitis and increased ICP
   - continue monitoring MS
   - pt has increased somnolence with PO dilaudid
 with transition to
   fentanyl patch
   - drain to reduce ICP

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV admitted to the ICU for recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. He has been treated with Ambisome and attempted to start flucytosine but not tolerating orally. The patient underwent a second lumbar drain placement due to increasing lumbar pressures. The goal drain pressure is less than 25mmHg, and the lumbar drain is on continuous drainage. Daily CSF analysis for WBC, glucose, and protein will be conducted. The patient continues to receive Ambisome, attempt to give flucytosine, and is being followed by ID. Repeat cryptococcal antigen titer is pending, and the patient may need a VP shunt if the drain does not work. Neurosurgery recommendations include discussing an MRI brain to rule out further infection and considering possible elective intubation for MRI. Ophthalmology consult may be required if pressures remain elevated per neuro recommendations. The patient's WBC count is rising, and he was diaphoretic last night, with blood cultures drawn. 

Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent cryptococcal meningitis: The patient has a history of this condition, which is causing increased lumbar pressures and requires ongoing management with antifungal medications.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is rising, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, likely secondary to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV admitted to the ICU for recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. He has been on ambisome therapy but is not tolerating oral flucytosine. A lumbar drain has been placed, and the goal is to keep drain pressure below 25mmHg. Daily CSF analysis for WBC, glucose, and protein is ongoing. The patient continues on ambisome, vancomycin, and flucytosine. There are concerns about the possibility of needing a VP shunt if the lumbar drain does not work and the need for an MRI to rule out further infection. Ophthalmology consultation may be required if pressures remain elevated as per neurology recommendations.

Other findings include leukocytosis with a rising WBC count, hypokalemia likely due to frequent diarrhea and vomiting, ongoing diarrhea (C. diff negative), nausea/vomiting likely secondary to increased intracranial pressure, delirium possibly due to meningitis and increased ICP, thrush in the oropharynx, acute renal failure now improving, chronic asthma, and multiple wounds on the back requiring wound care and ID consultations.

The patient is currently on TPN with lipids and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI. Prophylactic measures include SQ UF heparin for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV who has recurrent cryptococcal meningitis, increasing lumbar pressures, and is currently on ambisome therapy. He is experiencing intolerance to oral flucytosine and has undergone a second lumbar drain placement. The goal is to maintain drain pressure below 25mmHg. Daily CSF analysis for WBC, glucose, and protein will be conducted. The patient's WBC count is rising, and he was diaphoretic last night, prompting blood culture collection. The patient has a history of HIV with a CD4 count of 175 and undetectable viral load. HAART medication was initially changed for renal dosing but was stopped due to nausea and vomiting from increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The patient is also experiencing hypokalemia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, delirium, thrush, acute renal failure (ARF), and asthma. The patient is currently on TPN and has a PICC line in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent cryptococcal meningitis with increasing lumbar pressures may lead to further neurological complications if not adequately managed.
2. The rising WBC count could indicate an ongoing infection or a complication such as leukocytosis.
3. Hypokalemia needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. The continuous diarrhea could be due to Clostridium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old individual with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis, increasing lumbar pressures, and a recent lumbar drain placement. They are experiencing multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, hypokalemia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, delirium, thrush, acute renal failure (ARF), and asthma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cryptococcal Meningitis: The patient has recurrent cryptococcal meningitis, which is an infection of the brain and spinal cord caused by the fungus Cryptococcus. This can lead to increased intracranial pressure, neurological symptoms, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is rising, indicating an infection or inflammation in the body. Further investigation and treatment are required to determine the underlying cause.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which may be due to frequent diarrhea and vomiting. Aggressive repletion of potassium is necessary to correct this electrolyte imbalance.
4. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing continuous diarrhea, with an unclear cause. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) testing has been negative, so alternative causes need to be explored.
5. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient is likely experiencing nausea and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure. These symptoms need to be managed appropriately to prevent further complications.

   # Cryptococcal Meningitis
  was treated for first episode [**9-13**] with
   ambisome and flucytosine, then maintained on Fluconazole. Now with
   recurrent infection. Cryptococcal antigen titer is >1:64. He has been
   on ambisone and attempted to start flucytosine but not tolerating
   orally. He has had high opening pressures on LP up to 41. Now s/p
   Lumbar drain. Pt refuses MRI.
   - goal drain pressure <25mmHg
   - Lumbar drain on continuous drainage for now
   - daily CSF to be sent for WBC, glucose, protein
   - continue ambisome and attempt to give flucytosine
   - ID is following, appreciate recommendations
   - repeat cryptococcal antigen titer is pending
   - neurosurgery recs, pt may need VP shunt if drain dose not work
   - continue to discuss MRI brain with pt to r/o further infection
   - may need ophtho consult if pressures remain elevated per neuro recs
   .
   # HIV: CD4 175, viral load undectable. meds were changed initially for
   renal dosing, now off of HAART secondary to nausea and vomiting from
   increased ICP.
   - Will restart HAART meds once able to tolerated orals, or will try NGT
   if vomitting reoccurs
   - ID recs appreciated
   - Bactrim ppx

   # Hypokalemia: K has been low for last several days, likely secondary
   to frequent diarrhea and vomitting
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - replete potassium aggressively
   .
   # Diarrhea: having continuous diarrhea, unclear cause. C. Diff x 1
   negative
   - recheck c. diff
   - continue flagyl treatment
   .
   # N/V: likely from increased ICP. Also possible other infection souce
   due to immunocompromised state, or may been side effect of medication.
   However elevated ICP more likely due to projectile nature of emesis.
   - clears and ADAT
   - drain to reduce ICP
   .
   # Delerium: Likely secondary to menigitis and increased ICP. Has
   improved after drain was placed today.
   - continue monitoring MS

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis, increasing lumbar pressures, and intolerance to oral medications. He has been treated with ambisome and flucytosine, but the infection has recurred. The patient's current vital signs are within normal ranges, with a blood pressure of 160/85 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving multiple IV medications, including heparin sodium, lorazepam, hydromorphone, and others. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and low potassium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Cryptococcal Meningitis: The patient's cryptococcal meningitis has recurred despite previous treatment with ambisome and flucytosine. It is crucial to continue appropriate antifungal therapy to prevent further complications.
2. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's high opening pressures on lumbar puncture (up to 41 mmHg) indicate increased ICP. This can lead to neurological deterioration and requires immediate management, such as lumbar drain placement and monitoring.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels (3.9 mEq/L) may contribute to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of HIV and recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. He is currently in the ICU for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) related to the meningitis. The patient underwent a second lumbar drain placement to manage the increased ICP. 

The patient has several medical complications including leukocytosis, hypokalemia, renal failure, delirium, oral thrush, and diarrhea. He is also experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to CNS irritation. The cause of his diarrhea is unclear, but Clostridium difficile has been ruled out. 

The patient has a CD4 count of 175 and an undetectable viral load. HAART medications have been restarted once the patient could tolerate orals. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has a history of recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. This can lead to complications such as increased ICP, seizures, and neurological deficits.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is rising, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. This could potentially lead to sepsis if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, which can result in cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory distress.
4. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which can worsen if not properly managed. This"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV who has been admitted to the ICU for recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and increasing lumbar pressures. The patient underwent a lumbar drain placement and is currently on continuous drainage with a goal drain pressure less than 25 mmHg. The patient's white blood cell count is rising, and he has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He has a history of HSV lesions on his buttock and is being treated with acyclovir. The patient's potassium levels are low, and he has acute renal failure. He has thrush in his mouth and chronic asthma. The patient has multiple wounds on his back, and a wound care consult has been ordered. The patient is intubated and will undergo an elective MRI of the head and spine today. The patient's current medications include acetaminophen, acyclovir, albuterol inhaler, ambisome, clotrimazole, darunavir, diphenhydramine, emtricitabine-enfuvirtide, fentanyl patch, flucytosine, heparin, ipratropium bromide MDI, lorazepam, metronidazole, nystatin oral suspension, ondansetron, pantoprazole, polyethylene glycol, prochlorperazine, propofol, raltegravir ritonavir, sulfameth/trimethoprim SS, and vancomycin. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires aggressive treatment and close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has recurrent cryptococcal meningitis, which is a serious infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be secondary to meningitis or other underlying conditions. Delirium increases the risk of falls, respiratory complications, and worsening of overall prognosis.

3. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and abnormal heart rhythms.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can be caused by sepsis, dehydration, or nephrotoxic drugs. It is important to monitor renal function closely and adjust medications accordingly.

5. Diarrhea: The patient has continuous diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition if not managed appropriately.

6. Thrush: The patient has thrush in his mouth, which can spread to other parts of the body if not treated promptly with antifungal medications.

7. Wound Infections: The patient has multiple wounds on his back, and there is a risk of wound infections, especially considering his immunocompromised state.

8. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient has chronic asthma, and any exacerbation can lead to respiratory distress and increased risk of complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV who has been admitted to the ICU for recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and increasing lumbar pressures. The patient underwent a second lumbar drain placement, and the goal is to keep the drain pressure below 25mmHg. The patient is currently on continuous drainage with the lumbar drain. Daily CSF tests will be sent for WBC, glucose, and protein levels. The patient is also on ambisome and attempting to take flucytosine orally, although not tolerating it well. ID is following up, and recommendations are appreciated. The patient's CD4 count is 175 with an undetectable viral load. HAART medications will be restarted once the patient can tolerate orals, and Bactrim prophylaxis has been started. The patient also has leukocytosis, hypokalemia, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, delirium, thrush, acute renal failure, asthma, and various wounds on his back. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and multiple interventions are ongoing to manage his various medical complications."

- Daily CSF will be sent for WBC, glucose, and protein.
- Ambisome and flucytosine will be continued, and ID will follow up.
- Repeat cryptococcal antigen titer is pending.
- Neurosurgery recommends a VP shunt if the drain does not work.
- MRI brain with/without and MRI TLS spine are scheduled for today with elective intubation.
- Continue ambisome, vanco, and flucytosine.

2. Leukocytosis:
- The patient's WBC count is rising.
- The patient remains afebrile at present.
- An MRI today may help identify the CNS source.
- Will follow up.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of HIV, presenting with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and increasing lumbar pressures. He underwent a second lumbar drain placement and is currently on continuous drainage with the goal of keeping drain pressure below 25 mmHg. The patient is also receiving treatment with ambisome and attempting to start flucytosine, but not tolerating it orally. He has been diagnosed with candidiasis, leukocytosis, hypokalemia, renal failure, delirium, diarrhea, and thrush. The patient's CD4 count is 175, and his viral load is undetectable. He is currently intubated and will undergo an MRI of the brain and spine today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has recurrent cryptococcal meningitis, which is a serious infection that can lead to complications such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and neurological deficits.
2. Candidiasis: The patient has oral candidiasis, which can spread to other parts of the body if not treated appropriately.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and abnormal heart rhythms.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old individual with HIV who has been admitted to the ICU for recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and increasing lumbar pressures. The patient underwent a second lumbar drain placement and is currently on continuous drainage with a goal drain pressure less than 25 mmHg. 

The patient's medical history includes a previous episode of cryptococcal meningitis, oral thrush, and a low CD4 count of 175 with an undetectable viral load. They have been started on HAART medications but are experiencing difficulty tolerating oral intake. A post-pyloric tube will be placed to deliver HAART and nutrition.

The patient is also diagnosed with leukocytosis, HSV lesions on the buttock, hypokalemia, diarrhea (negative for C. diff), nausea/vomiting (initially thought to be related to increased ICP, but now believed to be related to CNS irritation), delirium likely secondary to meningitis, and oral thrush.

Renal function has improved from a peak creatinine level of 1.9 to the current level of 1.2. The patient has chronic asthma and is on TPN with lipids while intubated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of cryptococcal meningitis, development of further opportunistic infections due to immunocompromised state, progression of renal failure, worsening of asthma, and potential complications related to the placement and management of"

   # Cryptococcal Meningitis
  recurrent infx
 has been on ambisome and
   attempted to start flucytosine but not tolerating orally.
   - s/p lumbar drain with goal pressure < 25
 set to continuous drainage
   - daily CSF to be sent for WBC, glucose, protein
 WBC and protein
   increasing; glucose overall steady
 ID following results; will
   follow-up CSF results
   - continue ambisome and attempt to give flucytosine
 appreciate that
   flucytosine itself can cause nausea
   - will continue vanc for coag neg staph in CNS per ID rec.
   - sent CSF for cytology and will send CSF for repeat crypto antigen
   - also, supposed trauma to LP drain during MRI yesterday; pt with fever
   and increased WBC; CSF becoming more blood-tinged and pt had increased
   drain pressure last night
 will send CSF cx today
 in light of this,
   would also like to pull lumbar drain today; will contact neurosurgery
   - [**Name2 (NI) **]-cultured with fever last night
 will f/u
   - MRI showed meningeal irritation
   # Mechanical Ventilation
   - pt was electively intubated for procedures yesterday
   - will plan to extubate today
 will contact all teams involved to make
   sure this is ok
   #Leukocytosis
   - trending up (now at 20) and pt was febrile last night
   - [**Name2 (NI) **]-cultured
 will f/u
   - will send CSF cultures today
 will f/u
   - MRI identified no CNS focus of infection
   - consider adding gram negative coverage to pt
s abx regimen
   .
   # HIV
 CD4 175, viral load undectable
   - will restart HAART once post-pyloric tube is in place and pt
   tolerating PO
   - Bactrim ppx
   .
   #HSV: HSV lesions on buttock
   - will finish course of acyclovir
   - will follow wound care recs
   - derm felt that HSV lesions looked healed and that most of patient
   lesions were [**3-9**] to HPV
   # Hypokalemia
 no acute issues
   - now 4.8
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea
   - pt to get post-pyloric tube for nutrition and meds
   - C. Diff x 2 negative
 stopped flagyl
   - GI consult
 recommended CT abdomen/pelvis (which was normal) and
   then EGC/flex sig when more stable
 also recommended zofran and
   compazine PRN
   # Delerium: Likely secondary to menigitis
   - continue monitoring MS
   - neuron recs: f/u EEG, limit dilaudid, f/u MRI head (just showed
   meningeal irritation), f/u CSF VDRL and flow cytometry, continue abx
   - transition to fentanyl patch to have patient on less PO dilaudid
   .
   # Thrush: seen on exam
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # ARF
   - Cr now 2.0 (highest this admit)
   - pt seems dry on exam
 will give fluids
   - will check urine electrolytes

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV who has been admitted to the ICU. He has a history of recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and is currently being treated with Ambisome. The patient is also experiencing fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and confusion. He has an increased white blood cell count and his CSF is showing signs of meningeal irritation. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he is showing signs of hypokalemia. He also has oral candidiasis and a history of asthma.

The patient's current medications include metronidazole, vancomycin, Ambisome, propofol, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin, hydromorphone, and nystatin. The patient has been intubated for mechanical ventilation and is expected to be extubated today. The plan is to restart HAART once the post-pyloric tube is in place and the patient is tolerating PO.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent Cryptococcal Meningitis: The patient has a history of this condition and is currently being treated with Ambisome. However, the presence of fever and increased WBC count in the CSF suggests a possible recurrence or progression of the infection.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may require further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of HIV and recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. He is currently in the ICU with various medical complications. He has a fever of 101.6°F, impaired skin integrity, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, delirium/confusion, oral candidiasis, and leukocytosis. The patient's CD4 count is 175, and his viral load is undetectable. He has been on ambisome for cryptococcal meningitis but is not tolerating oral flucytosine. A lumbar drain has been placed, and he is on continuous drainage with the goal of maintaining drain pressure below 25mmHg. CSF analysis is ongoing to monitor WBC, glucose, and protein levels. The patient is intubated and requires a post-pyloric tube for nutrition and HAART restart. Other issues include HSV lesions on the buttock, hypokalemia, continuous diarrhea, and potential causes such as HIV, CNS irritation, or medication side effects. The patient also has asthma, which is currently not acute. Renal function is being closely monitored. The patient's condition requires further evaluation and management of various infections and complications.

Potential medical complications:
1. Recurrent cryptococcal meningitis with increasing lumbar pressures.
2. Impaired skin integrity due to oral candidiasis.
3. Headache and delirium/confusion secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status. There are no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungal medication, and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, headache, and altered mental status, along with the MRI findings showing meningeal irritation, suggest the possibility of meningitis.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status may indicate sepsis, which could be secondary to a severe infection.
3. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and confusion could be due to delirium, possibly caused by infection or other underlying conditions.
5. Candidiasis: The presence of oral candidiasis (thrush) indicates an immunocompromised state, which could be related to HIV/AIDS.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization in the ICU.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to endotracheal intubation.
8. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis due to the risk of developing stress-induced gastric ulcers in the ICU setting."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Critical Care;
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He remains responsive to name on minimal sedation. CSF drain has been
   pulled by neurosurgical staff and cultures resent. Last pressure close
   to 26 under sedation. He has still needed dilaudid for his headache. We
   will repeat CSF studies ( per Dr [**Name (NI) 7648**]
s request) including
   cytology. He will need vigorous IVF fluid rescucitation with rise in
   creatinine ( IV contrast) after recent scans. I am hoping he will
   tolerate attempt at extubation later today if there is no procedure
   planned for him. Nutritional intake is key and he may need TPN until
   nausea and emesis have subsided and if post pyloric feeds are not
   tolerated.
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7649**] has been updated.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV who has been admitted to the ICU for recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. He is currently on Ambisome and attempted to start flucytosine but is not tolerating it orally. A lumbar drain has been placed with the goal of keeping the pressure below 25. CSF cultures have been sent for WBC, glucose, and protein levels, and the patient will continue to receive vancomycin for coag-neg staph in the CNS as per ID rec.

The patient is also experiencing fever, increased WBC count, and increased drain pressure. An MRI showed meningeal irritation. The plan is to pull the lumbar drain today and contact neurosurgery for further evaluation.

Mechanical ventilation has been initiated, and the plan is to extubate the patient today after consulting with all involved teams. The patient has leukocytosis, trending up to 20, and was febrile last night. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient's HIV status is mentioned, with a CD4 count of 175 and undetectable viral load. HAART will be restarted once the patient tolerates PO and a post-pyloric tube is in place. Bactrim prophylaxis has been initiated.

Other issues include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, delirium likely secondary to meningitis, thrush, acute renal failure (ARF), asthma, and hypokalemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV who is currently in the ICU. He has a history of recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and is being treated with Ambisome and flucytosine. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 126/71 mmHg to 174/95 mmHg, heart rate between 94-128 bpm, respiratory rate of 12-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN: The patient has a fever of 101.5°F, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the fever.

2. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to his HIV status or other underlying conditions. This increases the risk of infections and should be monitored closely.

3. HEADACHE: The patient presents with a headache, which may be related to his cryptococcal meningitis or other underlying conditions. Adequate pain management and further evaluation are necessary.

4. MENINGITIS, OTHER: Given the patient's history of recurrent cryptococcal meningitis, there is a possibility of other types of meningitis. Appropriate diagnostic tests, such as CSF analysis, should be performed to determine the causative agent.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV and recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. He has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient underwent a second lumbar drain placement due to increasing lumbar pressures. He is currently on Ambisome and flucytosine for cryptococcal meningitis. 

The patient was electively intubated for procedures yesterday and is planned for extubation today. He has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.6 and was febrile last night. Pan-culture was sent for further evaluation. 

The patient's CD4 count is 175, and viral load is undetectable. He will restart HAART once a post-pyloric tube is in place and he can tolerate oral intake. 

The patient has HSV lesions on his buttock, which are being treated with acyclovir. Dermatology assesses that most of the patient's lesions are likely due to HPV. 

The patient has hypokalemia with a potassium level of 4.7. His nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are being managed with a post-pyloric tube for nutrition and medications. C. Diff x 2 negative and Flagyl was stopped. 

The patient's delirium is likely secondary to meningitis. Neurology recommendations include following up on EEG, limiting dilaudid, following up on an MRI head, and continuing abx.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, presenting with fever, headache, meningitis, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, delirium/confusion, and oral candidiasis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The patient's vital signs show a fever, elevated heart rate, and stable blood pressure. His respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV with FiO2 set at 40%. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's skin integrity appears impaired, and he has a central line in place. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing concerns regarding his fever, possible aspiration, and potential complications from his underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent vomiting when sedation was decreased raises concerns about potential aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
3. Renal failure: The patient's abnormal kidney function tests indicate acute renal failure, which requires careful management to prevent further deterioration.
4. Delirium: The patient's confusion and altered mental status may indicate delirium, which can complicate"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old individual with HIV who has been admitted to the ICU with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. The patient underwent a lumbar drain placement and was started on Ambisome and flucytosine. The MRI showed meningeal irritation consistent with cryptococcal meningitis. The patient's current condition includes fever, impaired skin integrity, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, delirium/confusion, and candidiasis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Meningitis: Cryptococcal meningitis can lead to complications such as increased intracranial pressure (ICP), seizures, brain abscesses, or hearing loss.

2. Skin infections: Impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections, wound infections, or cellulitis.

3. Headache: Persistent or severe headaches can be a sign of increased ICP or intracranial hypertension due to the ongoing infection.

4. Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: These symptoms may indicate gastrointestinal involvement or complications, such as Clostridium difficile infection, especially if the patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

5. Renal failure: Acute renal failure can occur as a complication of sepsis, dehydration, or direct infection of the kidneys.

6. Delirium/confusion: Delirium may be secondary to the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV who is admitted to the ICU with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and increasing lumbar pressures. He has undergone a second lumbar drain placement and is currently being treated with ambisome and flucytosine. The patient's medical history includes HIV, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, delirium/confusion, candidiasis, and HSV lesions on the buttock. His current medications include vancomycin for coag-negative staph in the CNS, acyclovir for HSV, and HAART for HIV. The patient has leukocytosis, hypokalemia, and is at risk for thrombosis, stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His vital signs are stable, but he is febrile. The patient's recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and blood glucose levels. His imaging studies reveal meningeal irritation consistent with cryptococcal meningitis. The patient's plan includes extubation today, placement of a post-pyloric tube for nutrition and HAART, and follow-up with repeat CSF tests, MRI head, and other consults as needed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent cryptococcal meningitis: The patient has a history of this condition and is currently being treated with antifungal medications. However, there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV admitted to the ICU for recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and increasing lumbar pressures. The patient underwent a second lumbar drain placement and is currently receiving vancomycin for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infection in the central nervous system, as per Infectious Disease recommendations. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sent for cytology and will be repeated for cryptococcal antigen. The patient is also pan-cultured with fever last night and will follow up with the results. An MRI showed meningeal irritation consistent with cryptococcal meningitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Cryptococcal Meningitis: The patient has a history of recurrent cryptococcal meningitis, which is an opportunistic infection commonly seen in individuals with HIV/AIDS. This condition can lead to increased intracranial pressure, neurological complications, and potential deterioration in mental status.
2. Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus Infection: The patient is being treated with vancomycin for a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infection in the central nervous system. This type of infection can result in bacteremia, sepsis, and local complications such as abscesses or meningitis.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, which can cause muscle weakness, cramps, abnormal heart rhythms, and other electroly"

   # Cryptococcal Meningitis
  recurrent infx
 has been on ambisome and
   flucytosine (d/c
d [**8-17**]).
   - s/p removal of lumbar drain
   - will continue vanc for coag neg staph in CNS per ID rec.
   - sent CSF for cytology and will send CSF for repeat crypto antigen
   - pan-cultured with fever last night
 will f/u
   - MRI showed meningeal irritation
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7695**] to talk to ID re: duration of ambisome
   #Leukocytosis
   - now at 16.6 and pt was febrile last night
   - pan-cultured
 will f/u

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 56-year-old male with HIV, presenting with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis and increasing lumbar pressures.
- Patient underwent a second lumbar drain placement.
- Current medications include vancomycin for coag-neg staph in CNS, fluconazole, and ambisome for cryptococcal meningitis.
- Patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 16.6, and he had a fever last night.
- Pan-culture was done, and CSF will be sent for cytology and repeat crypto antigen.
- MRI showed meningeal irritation.
- The patient has a CD4 count of 175 and an undetectable viral load.
- HAART therapy was restarted once the post-pyloric tube is in place and the patient can tolerate PO.
- Bactrim prophylaxis was also initiated.
- The patient has HSV lesions on his buttock, which are being treated with acyclovir.
- Dermatology consulted, and it was determined that most of the lesions are likely due to HPV.
- The patient has hypokalemia but no acute issues.
- Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are ongoing, but these appear to be under control, likely related to ambisome.
