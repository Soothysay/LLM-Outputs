   insufficiency since patient is on chronic steroids.  Unlikely this is
   cardiogenic since patient has no new ECG changes, no CP.  Recently had
   ECHO with hyperdynamic EF and e/o diastolic HF. Unlikely to be blood

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presents with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has been placed on CPAP overnight and is showing improvement. Her ABG results show pH 7.36, PaCO2 52 mmHg, PaO2 62 mmHg, HCO3- 31 mEq/L, and SaO2 97%. She has a language barrier and is unable to provide a history. The patient is allergic to belladonna alkaloids, experiencing itching and swelling. She has received infusions and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension due to dehydration and diarrhea with poor oral intake. Other possible causes include infection. She is currently responsive to fluids but further assessment is needed. The possibility of relative adrenal insufficiency should be considered since the patient is on chronic steroids. Cardiogenic causes are unlikely as there are no new ECG changes or congestive symptoms. An echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic ejection fraction and evidence of diastolic heart failure. Blood loss is also unlikely since the hematocrit (HCT) is stable. 
   - Plan: Gentle intravenous fluid boluses will be given to keep syst"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presents with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has been put on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) overnight with good effect. Her last arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 52, PaO2 of 62, HCO3 of 31, and BE of -2.

The patient is unable to provide history due to a language barrier. She has allergies to belladonna alkaloids, experiencing itching and swelling. The last dose of antibiotics was given. Infusions and other ICU medications are mentioned but not specified. Other medications include Belladonna Alkaloids, antibiotics, and unspecified medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below, but it cannot be obtained due to a language barrier. Flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values.

Assessment and plan:
- Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to dehydration and diarrhea with poor oral intake. Other possible causes include infection. Currently, the patient is responding well to fluids, so gentle intravenous fluid boluses will be given to maintain systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg. If the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including MDS, PE on lovenox, CKD, Crohn's disease, recent pneumonia admission, and chronic prednisone use. She presented with low oral intake, low urine output, hypersomnolence, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient is currently on BiPAP for respiratory support and has shown improvement in her ABG. She has a history of allergies to belladonna alkaloids. The patient is unable to provide her own medical history due to a language barrier. 

24-hour events include fluid resuscitation for hypotension, which resolved, and the use of BiPAP overnight with improvement in ABG. Cultures have been taken, and the patient is on infusions and other ICU medications. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/50 mmHg to 78/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation at 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with total input and output, and respiratory support indicates the use of CPAP/PSV with FiO2 at 30%. ABG results show pH at 7.36, PaCO2 at 52 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 207, and Ve at 4 L/min. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe, soft non-tender abdomen, muscle wasting, and multiple ecchymoses. Neurologic examination shows lethargy. Labs show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Other lab results are within normal ranges or slightly elevated. Imaging shows a decrease in right effusion and left lower lobe infiltrate vs effusion, with volume overload. An ECG is unremarkable. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is critically ill with a history of PE on lovenox, MDS, CKD, anemia, and CAD. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. 

Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient is likely volume depleted due to fecal transfusion and diarrhea. Infection as a source of sepsis will be ruled out. IV fluids will be administered cautiously due to signs of volume overload. If oxygenation worsens and urine output remains low while blood pressure is stable, gentle diuresis may be considered. Follow-up cultures for Clostridium difficile and antibiotic coverage for pneumonia will continue. 

2. Hypoxia: The patient is on supplemental oxygen at baseline, approximately 2.5 liters at home. Hypoxia is likely multi-factorial, including left lower lobe pneumonia and volume overload. Empiric coverage"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic kidney disease (CKD), Crohn's disease, and recent pneumonia. She presented with hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is on long-term oxygen therapy and chronic prednisone treatment. She has been unresponsive to commands and unable to provide a history due to a language barrier.

The patient's vital signs have shown improvement with fluid resuscitation, and she has been placed on BiPAP 15/5 overnight. Cultures have been taken, and she is currently receiving antibiotics. The patient has a history of allergies to belladonna alkaloids, causing itching and swelling.

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The patient's flow sheet data shows fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and other relevant parameters.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, and various abnormalities such as PERRL eyes, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, lymphedema with hemorrhagic bullae on the right lower extremity, tender left lower extremity, muscle wasting, and multiple ecchymoses. Neurological examination was not fully assessed.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, normal potassium levels, slightly low sodium, and normal liver function tests. The patient"

   anemia, CAD who presents with hypoxia and hypotension and altered
   mental status.
   Plan:
   # Hypotension: Likely volume deplete due to FTT and diarrhea.  Will
   continue to r/o infectious source/sepsis.
   - Cautious IVF given showing signs of volume overload.   If worsening
   of oxygenation and low UOP with stable BP, will consider gentle
   diuresis.
   - Follow-up cultures/c.diff
   - On vanc/levo for empiric PNA coverage
   # Hypoxia: on O2 at baseline; approximately 2.5L at home.  Likely
   multi-factorial: LLL PNA and volume overload. Pt anticoagulated for h/o
   PE.
   - Continue vanc/levo
   - Continue BiPap as needed
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: likely pre-renal given poor PO intake and diarrhea.
   - Continue to follow creatinine while optimizing volume status.
   - Follow-up urine lytes.
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-3**] hypercarbia/infection.
   - Head CT to r/o any acute processes.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old Russian-speaking woman with a history of multiple medical conditions, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), pulmonary embolism (PE) on lovenox, chronic kidney disease (CKD), Crohn's disease, and recent admission for pneumonia. She presented with low oxygen intake, low urine output, and one day of hypersomnolence. The patient was found to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of 69 in the emergency department and responded well to fluid resuscitation. She was placed on BiPAN 15/5 overnight, which improved her arterial blood gas (ABG) results.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, and her last dose was not specified. She has allergies to belladonna alkaloids, causing itching and swelling. The patient is unable to provide her medical history due to a language barrier.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for new symptoms. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/50 to 78/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient received a total of 45 mL and 95 mL of intravenous fluids within the last 24 hours. Her blood products intake and output are within normal limits."

   # Hypotension: Likely in the setting of dehydration and diarrhea with
   poor PO intake.  Other possibilites include infection.  Currently
   responsive to fluids.  other causes could include relative adrenal
   insufficiency since patient is on chronic steroids.  Unlikely this is
   cardiogenic since patient has no new ECG changes, no CP.  Recently had
   ECHO with hyperdynamic EF and e/o diastolic HF. Unlikely to be blood
   loss since HCT stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presents with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient's recent events include a head CT showing no acute changes, consolidation at the left base on chest CT, bilateral tib/fib films showing soft tissue swelling but no fractures, tolerance issues with BiPAP, and an ABG off BiPAP of 7.35/57/88. The patient was placed back on BiPAP due to an ABG of 7.28/72/80.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left), volume overload secondary to diastolic heart failure, and MSK weakness. This has resulted in acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to dehydration and diarrhea with poor oral intake. Initial concerns for sepsis or adrenal insufficiency are unlikely. A recent echo showed a hyperdynamic EF and evidence of diastolic HF, which has since resolved.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is at baseline, and medications will be dosed accordingly.
4. Altered mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and coronary artery disease.
- She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status.
- The patient has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics (Vancomycin and Levofloxacin), and Omeprazole.
- She has been on BiPap for respiratory support.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/35 to 152/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 840 mL total fluids, with 200 mL of PO intake, 640 mL of IV fluids, and 74 mL of blood products transfused.
- She has had a total output of 1280 mL of urine, -440 mL of fluid balance deficit, and a negative NG output.
- The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 553 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.28, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 72 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 270 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 4.7 L/min.
- The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.0 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) of 3.2 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 164 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.3 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 33 mmHg, and blood glucose of 91 mg/dL.
- Imaging studies reveal severe rotation with potential increased pulmonary edema/effusions, as well as large bilateral effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis vs infiltrate.
- The patient's urine culture is negative.
- The assessment and plan include addressing hypotension, hypoxia, altered mental status, and optimizing volume status while monitoring for signs of volume overload.
- The patient is also being followed up for possible Clostridium difficile infection, and her antibiotic coverage includes Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
- The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is anticoagulated.
- A head CT is planned to rule out any acute processes causing the altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and hypotension could indicate an underlying infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and fluid balance deficit suggest the possibility of AKI.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of crackles in the lung bases, hypoxia, and infiltrates on imaging may indicate pneumonia.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of PE and immobilization in the ICU increase the risk for DVT.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's diarrhea and recent antibiotic use raise concerns for C. difficile infection.
6. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid balance deficit and signs of volume overload indicate the need to monitor and manage her fluid status carefully.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on BiPap for oxygenation may suggest the possibility of respiratory failure."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of PE, MDS, CKD, anemia, and CAD. She presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and BiPap for respiratory support. Imaging shows large bilateral effusions and LLL atelectasis versus infiltrate. The patient is currently stable, but ongoing management includes monitoring ABGs, following up with cultures/c.diff, considering gentle diuresis, and potentially tapping effusions if no improvement with diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and shock. Gentle diuresis may be considered to manage volume overload.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial, including LLL PNA and volume overload/effusions. Ongoing management includes BiPap as needed and consideration of tapping effusions if no improvement with diuresis.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hypercarbia/infection. Head CT has been performed to rule out any acute processes, and mental status is improving.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's CKD may worsen due to poor PO intake, diarrhea, and potential side effects of medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of PE on lovenox, MDS, CKD,
   anemia, CAD who presents with hypoxia and hypotension and altered
   mental status.
    Plan:
   # Hypotension: Now resolved - likely volume deplete due to FTT and
   diarrhea.  Now with signs of volume overload.
   - Consider gentle diuresis.
   - Follow-up cultures/c.diff
   - On vanc/levo for empiric PNA coverage
   # Hypoxia: on O2 at baseline; approximately 2.5L at home.  Likely
   multi-factorial: LLL PNA ( radiographic improvement) and volume
   overload/effusions. Pt anticoagulated for h/o PE.
   - Continue vanc/levo
   - Continue BiPap as needed
 hopefully will transition to qhs BiPap
   - Consider tapping effusions if no improvement with diuresis
   - Follow ABGs
   # ARF on CKD: likely pre-renal given poor PO intake and diarrhea.
   Stable.
   - Follow creatinine with diuresis
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-3**] hypercarbia/infection.   Head CT
   unremarkable.  Mental status improving.
   - Head CT to r/o any acute processes.
   #PE/DVT: On lovenox with ARF
    - Will verify heme
s plan for treating with lovenox in ARF.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of pulmonary embolism, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and coronary artery disease. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has been receiving vancomycin and levofloxacin for empirical pneumonia coverage. Her vital signs are stable, but she shows signs of volume overload. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely pre-renal due to poor oral intake and diarrhea. Her mental status is improving, and further investigations are planned. She is on lovenox for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and her plan for treating with lovenox in acute renal failure needs verification. Other issues are mentioned in the resident's note. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her goals of care have been discussed with her daughter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient shows signs of volume overload, which can lead to complications such as congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Infection: The patient is on empirical antibiotic coverage for pneumonia, indicating a risk of infection. If the infection is not appropriately managed, it can lead to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can worsen renal function"

   -13:28 ABG on BiPAP was 7.42/50/77/34 so given trial off BiPAP
   -Attempted to get blood gas off BiPAP later in evening but through a
   series of unfortunate events this was lost.  The patient is a difficult
   stick due to chronic edema/anasarca.  Put back on BiPAP empirically and
   repeat ABG was also on this.
   -Multiple discussions had with daughter about her reluctance to have
   any aggressive or invasive tests performed on her mother (including
   basic lab draws), she continues to be quite reluctant; this ultimately
   may lead to changes needing to be made in goals of care.

   82 year-old female with a history of PE, MDS, CKD, anemia, CAD who
   presents with hypoxia and hypotension.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory  failure:  Contributing factors
   include pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions (R>L),  volume overload
   secondary to diastolic heart failure, and MSK weakness.  On a.m. of
   [**2194-3-16**], had acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in
   setting of not being on BiPap overnight.  Now is stabilized post
   BiPap.  CXR shows reduced right pleural effusion after lasix.

   - increase po lasix dose with goal of even to neg 500cc
   # Hypotension: Likely in the setting of dehydration and diarrhea with
   poor PO intake.  Initially, there was concern for sepsis or adrenal
   insufficiency but both etiologies unlikely.  Recently had ECHO with
   hyperdynamic EF and e/o diastolic HF.   Resolved.

   # Chronic renal insufficiency:  Patient
s creatinine is at baseline.
   - renally dose meds
   # Altered MS:  per daughter, patient was initially not at baseline, but
   lethargy has now resolved with correction of hypercapnia.  Head CT
   shows no acute process.
   - continue to follow
   # DVT and PE: on lovenox at home with LMW heaprin levels followed (last
   level 1.04 on [**2194-3-4**])
   - will cont home lovenox 70 mg daily
   - consider checking level

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and coronary artery disease. She presents with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation intermittently, with episodes of both initiation and cessation.

Blood gas results show a morning reading of 7.28/72/81, leading to the restart of bipap. Another ABG reading on BiPAP was 7.42/50/77/34, after which the patient was given a trial off BiPAP. However, due to difficulties in obtaining blood gas samples due to chronic edema/anasarca, the patient was put back on BiPAP empirically, along with a repeat ABG.

The patient's allergies include Belladonna Alkaloids, causing itching and swelling. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on [**2194-3-15**] at 10:00 AM and Levofloxacin on [**2194-3-15**] at 08:00 PM.

Infusions include Furosemide (Lasix) initiated on [**2194-3-16**] at 11:51 AM. Other medications are also being administered.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/43"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presents with hypoxia and hypotension. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has been on non-invasive ventilation intermittently, with multiple starts and stops. Her blood gas in the morning showed pH 7.28, PaCO2 72, and HCO3- 81, so she was restarted on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). An arterial blood gas (ABG) later in the day showed pH 7.42, PaCO2 50, HCO3- 77, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 34% on BiPAP, leading to a trial off BiPAP being given. However, due to difficulties in obtaining blood samples from chronic edema/anasarca, the attempt to get an ABG off BiPAP was unsuccessful. The patient was put back on BiPAP empirically, and another ABG was taken. 

The patient's daughter is reluctant to perform any aggressive or invasive tests, including basic lab draws. This may lead to changes in the goals of care. 

The patient has allergies to belladonna alkaloids, causing itching and swelling. She has received vancomycin and levofloxacin antibiotics. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 71 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 117/43 mmHg (62) and 94/29 mmHg (46), respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute (insp/min), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. 

The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR). Her fluid balance shows an intake-output balance of -2526 mL and -466 mL respectively. 

She is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. Her tidal volume (Vt) is 693 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 30%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 24 cmH2O, and ABG results are pH 7.46, PaCO2 43, HCO3- 123, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. 

The patient's peripheral vascular examination shows no pulses assessed due to chronic edema/anasarca. Her skin examination is also not assessed. Neurologic examination reveals no response to stimuli, movement, tone, or assessed findings. 

Laboratory results include hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.9 g/dL"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of PE on lovenox, MDS, CKD,
   anemia, CAD who presents with hypoxia and hypotension and altered
   mental status.
    Plan:
   # Hypotension: Now resolved - likely volume deplete due to FTT and
   diarrhea.  Now with signs of volume overload.
   - Consider gentle diuresis.
   - Follow-up cultures/c.diff
   - On vanc/levo for empiric PNA coverage
   # Hypoxia: on O2 at baseline; approximately 2.5L at home.  Likely
   multi-factorial: LLL PNA ( radiographic improvement) and volume
   overload/effusions. Pt anticoagulated for h/o PE.
   - Continue vanc/levo
   - Continue BiPap as needed
 hopefully will transition to qhs BiPap
   - Consider tapping effusions if no improvement with diuresis
   - Follow ABGs
   # ARF on CKD: likely pre-renal given poor PO intake and diarrhea.
   Stable.
   - Follow creatinine with diuresis
   # Altered mental status: Likely [**3-3**] hypercarbia/infection.   Head CT
   unremarkable.  Mental status improving.
   - Head CT to r/o any acute processes.
   #PE/DVT: On lovenox with ARF
    - Will verify heme
s plan for treating with lovenox in ARF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and coronary artery disease. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/39 to 147/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including BiPap, vancomycin, levofloxacin, furosemide, and other medications. She has also undergone multiple interventions such as fluid removal, thoracentesis, and diuresis.

Laboratory results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, electrolytes, and other parameters. The patient's imaging shows decreased effusions and interstitial infiltrates consistent with diuresis.

The assessment and plan include several issues:
1. Hypotension: Resolved but now with signs of volume overload.
- Consider gentle diuresis.
- Follow-up cultures/c.diff
- On vanc/levo for empiric PNA coverage

2. Hypoxia: on O2 at baseline; approximately 2.5L at home. Likely multi-factorial: LLL P"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and coronary artery disease. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been improving over time, with resolution of hypotension and improvement in mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Volume overload: The patient shows signs of volume overload, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential heart failure.
2. Infection: The patient is currently on antibiotics for empirical pneumonia coverage, indicating a concern for infection. This could progress to a more severe infection if not appropriately managed.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and any further deterioration could lead to acute kidney injury or the need for dialysis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE and is currently on lovenox for anticoagulation. Monitoring for signs of DVT or PE is essential.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's poor oral intake and diarrhea can contribute to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of fluid status and electrolytes is necessary.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hypercarbia or infection. Continuous monitoring of mental status and appropriate management are required.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be improving,"
