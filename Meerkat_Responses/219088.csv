   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p
   Whipple/chemo/XRT, who presented with afferent limb obstruction of the
   pancreaticobiliary anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with
   hypotension s/p extrahepatic drain placement.
   .
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  He has
   remained hypotensive overnight and was placed on Levophed at 3 am.  CVL
   was placed, and he was started on Vanc/Zosyn.  Has metabolic acidosis
   with respiratory compensation and no evidence of tiring at this time.
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed and IVFs if necessary for goal
   MAP > 65
    - will start meropenem, d/c zosyn, for ESBL coverage
    - Continue Vanc
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
    - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h
    - Maintain glucose < 180
    - Consider stress dose steroids, though patient was not hypotensive
   for > 1h.
    - will c/s surgery if lactate or WBC continues to increase despite
   antibiotics and IVFs
    - monitor respiratory status
   .
   #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent
   limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent placement.
   The stent continues to drain serosanguinous fluid.
    - F/U bile cultures
    - F/U LFTs
    - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem
   .
   # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Defer to Oncology for
   further management.
   .
   # ARF:  The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from
   his baseline of 1.0.  Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe
   the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO
   intake) v. renal obstruction.  His UOP continues to decrease.
    - Give 50 mEq Bicarb prn
   - Continue IVFs as needed to maintain MAP > 65
    - F/U renal recs.
    - Use D5W with 3 amps HCO3 if needed for IVFs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  The patient had a K of 5.4 on admission to the ICU.
   ECG did not show evidence of peaked T waves.
    - recheck EKG
    - Give Kayexelate if needed
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS while in hospital.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer, who presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension following extrahepatic drain placement. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, likely secondary to biliary tree infection, metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, biliary obstruction due to tumor obstruction, widely metastatic pancreatic cancer, acute renal failure (ARF), and hyperkalemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening sepsis, progression of metabolic acidosis, further biliary obstruction, complications from pancreatic cancer such as pain or further metastasis, worsening ARF, and potential cardiac complications due to hyperkalemia.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:
- The patient has been hypotensive overnight and is on Levophed.
- CVL was placed, and he was started on Vanc/Zosyn.
- The patient has metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
- There is no evidence of tiring at this time.
- The patient's UOP remains poor.
- He was given 50 mEq bicarb for metabolic acidosis.
- The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from his baseline of 1.0.
- Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe the patient's ARF is likely ATN given"

   shock, oliguric renal failure and progressive metabolic acidosis.
   Likely etiology of sepsis is GNR bacteremia though BC were drawn today
   on antibiotics and may be sterile. Will continue zosyn and vancomycin,
   and will double cover for resistant GNR, initially with ciprofloxacin
   but may need a carbopenem. Will consider VRE as well. Aggressive

 Vanc/Meropenem for now pending biliary cultures.

   today.
   Addendum: after a long discussion with Mr [**Known lastname 8549**] this afternoon, he
   initially refused dialysis but then decided to proceed. He does not
   want to limit his care and remains full code. He continues to believe
   that he will beat the cancer and did not wish to burden his wife and
   ask that she come in to help with the goals of care discussion. He
   finally called his wife and she is supposedly on her way in. Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] is also going to try to come in tonight to speak to Mr
   [**Known lastname 8549**]. Separate from his metastatic pancreatic ca, prognosis from his
   sepsis remains poor. Dialysis to be initiated. If his acidosis
   progresses or he begins to fatigue, he would likely require ventilatory
   support. He expressed clearly that he would not want to live ventilator
   dependent. This discussion took place with [**Name8 (MD) 777**], RN, myself, and Dr

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma presenting with new jaundice, fevers, and hypotension. He underwent percutaneous stent placement but developed worsening sepsis, oliguric renal failure, and progressive metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently in the MICU receiving aggressive supportive care including pressors, antibiotics, and consideration for CVVH (likely ATN). Renal u/s is pending, and the renal team will discuss RRT with the patient today. The patient initially refused dialysis but later decided to proceed. He remains full code and does not want to limit his care. He believes he will beat the cancer and does not wish to burden his wife. He also does not want to live ventilator-dependent. The prognosis from his sepsis remains poor, and dialysis will be initiated. If his acidosis progresses or he begins to fatigue, he may require ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's worsening sepsis is a significant concern. It is likely caused by GNR bacteremia, and he is already on antibiotics. There is a possibility of resistant GNR, so additional coverage with ciprofloxacin or a carbopenem may be necessary. VRE should also be considered.
2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient is oliguric, indicating reduced urine output"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who presented with new jaundice, fevers, and hypotension. The patient underwent percutaneous stent placement but developed worsening sepsis and is now in the MICU with septic shock. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's respiratory support indicates that they may be experiencing respiratory acidosis due to inadequate ventilation or oxygenation.

2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which puts them at risk for further organ failure, such as acute kidney injury or liver dysfunction.

3. Sepsis-related Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite pressor support suggests ongoing septic shock, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

4. Infection: The likely etiology of sepsis is GNR bacteremia. The patient requires appropriate antibiotic coverage for this, along with consideration of resistant GNR and VRE.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguria and plans for hemodialysis suggest potential acute kidney injury or renal failure, possibly due to sepsis-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

6. Malnutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), which may lead to malnutrition if prolonged. Nutritional support should be considered once the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  On
   levophed and vasopressin, vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**].
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed, neo, vasopressin and IVFs if
   necessary for goal MAP > 65
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
   - Maintain glucose < 180
    - continue hydrocort for now
    - Consider stress dose steroids, though patient was not hypotensive
   for > 1h.
    - will c/s surgery if lactate or WBC continues to increase despite
   antibiotics and IVFs
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h; pH goal 7.25
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
   - touch base with family
   #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent
   limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent placement.
   The stent continues to drain serosanguinous fluid.
    - RUQ U/S to eval for more distal areas of obstruction and touch base
   with IR afterward
   - F/U LFTs
    - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem; add cipro for pseudomonas double coverage
   given bile + pseudomonas and s aureus (sensities pnd)
    - would consider lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy given AMS overnight
   - t/[**Initials (NamePattern4) 8572**] [**Doctor First Name 91**] re surgical options
   - t/b w IR re replacing drain
   # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] and fellow
   met with patient on [**8-27**].  No role for chemo in this setting but would
   consider afteward.
   - Defer to Oncology for further management.
   - palliative care c/s
   # ARF:  The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from
   his baseline of 1.0.  Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe
   the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO
   intake) v. renal obstruction.  HD line placed on [**8-27**] and now on CVVH.
    - cont CVVH
    - Continue IVFs as needed to maintain MAP > 65
    - F/U renal recs.
    - Use D5W with 3 amps HCO3 if needed for IVFs.
    - renally dose meds
   # Hyperkalemia:  The patient had a K of 5.4 on admission to the ICU.
   ECG did not show evidence of peaked T waves.
    - recheck EKG as needed
    - Give Kayexelate if needed
   # DM2: Continue HISS while in hospital.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer who has undergone Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension following extrahepatic drain placement.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and respiratory distress. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has multiple medical complications, including sepsis secondary to biliary tree infection, hypoxic respiratory failure due to volume overload, biliary obstruction caused by tumor obstruction of the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient is on multiple medications, including vasopressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and dialysis. He also requires nutritional support and management of his blood glucose levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to a biliary tree infection. He is already receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation. However, if his condition does not improve, further interventions such as surgical exploration or removal of the infected biliary tree may be necessary.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload in the setting of oliguria. Continued monitoring of his oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential. Adjust"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  On
   levophed and vasopressin, vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**].
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed and IVFs if necessary for goal
   MAP > 65
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
    - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h
    - Maintain glucose < 180
    - continue hydrocort for now
    - Consider stress dose steroids, though patient was not hypotensive
   for > 1h.
    - will c/s surgery if lactate or WBC continues to increase despite
   antibiotics and IVFs
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
   - touch base with family
   #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent
   limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent placement.
   The stent continues to drain serosanguinous fluid.
    - RUQ U/S to eval for more distal areas of obstruction and touch base
   with IR afterward
    - F/U bile cultures
    - F/U LFTs
    - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem
    - would consider lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy given AMS overnight
   # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] and fellow
   met with patient on [**8-27**].  No role for chemo in this setting but would
   consider afteward.
   - Defer to Oncology for further management.
   # ARF:  The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from
   his baseline of 1.0.  Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe
   the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO
   intake) v. renal obstruction.  HD line placed on [**8-27**] and now on CVVH.
    - cont CVVH
    - Continue IVFs as needed to maintain MAP > 65
    - F/U renal recs.
    - Use D5W with 3 amps HCO3 if needed for IVFs.
    - renally dose meds
   # Hyperkalemia:  The patient had a K of 5.4 on admission to the ICU.
   ECG did not show evidence of peaked T waves.
    - recheck EKG as needed
    - Give Kayexelate if needed
   # DM2: Continue HISS while in hospital.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who has undergone Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension following extrahepatic drain placement.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis secondary to a biliary tree infection. He is currently on levophed and vasopressin, and receiving vancomycin and meropenem for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) coverage. Stress dose steroids have been started.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia, likely due to volume overload in the setting of oliguria. He is currently on assisted control/controlled mechanical ventilation (AC/CMV) and will have fluid removed once his blood pressure stabilizes.

3. Biliary obstruction: The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis, which was stented. The stent continues to drain serosanguinous fluid.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level on admission was 3.3, which is higher than his baseline of 1.0. Renal consultation was sought, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic cancer who presented with obstruction of the proximal loop leading to biliary obstruction, respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's prognosis is grim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
2. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which can worsen his overall condition.
3. Ineffective coping: The patient's family is in denial about the poor outlook, and this can affect their ability to cope with the situation.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has ARF, which can further complicate his condition and potentially lead to kidney damage.
5. Respiratory acidosis: The patient has hypoxic acute respiratory failure likely from fluid overload, which can result in respiratory acidosis.
6. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs.
7. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.
8. Cancer: The patient has metastatic pancreatic cancer, which is a significant underlying condition affecting his overall prognosis.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consider additional"

   double coverage for GNRs. Additional source control procedures may
   include additional drains; will also discuss with surgery and IR.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic cancer who presented with obstruction of the proximal loop leading to biliary obstruction, septic shock, and acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has a grim prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia (high potassium): The patient has a high level of potassium, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
2. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may be due to the critical condition and the invasive procedures being performed.
3. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to cope effectively with the current situation may contribute to increased stress and anxiety.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the body and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Respiratory acidosis: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to fluid overload, resulting in inadequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination, leading to respiratory acidosis.
6. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can compromise blood flow to vital organs and contribute to shock.
7. Septic shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to the presence of biliary pus on intervention, although no positive blood cultures have been obtained yet.
8. Malignant neoplasm (cancer): The patient's metast"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who presented with hypotension and bacteremia. He underwent a Whipple procedure, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The patient was transferred to the ICU with hypotension after extrahepatic drain placement. His current condition is complicated by sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, biliary obstruction, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

1. Sepsis: The patient is already on vasopressin, levophed, and antibiotics (vanc/meropenem) for suspected biliary tree infection. Close monitoring and continued aggressive management will be necessary.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation due to hypoxia. ARDS is a concern, and the ARDS net protocol should be followed. Frequent checks of lactate and ABG levels are required.
3. Biliary Obstruction: The patient has tumor obstruction in the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis. Continued monitoring of liver function tests and management of bile drainage is essential.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from his baseline, and he has been placed on CVVH. Renal function should be closely monitored, and renal dosing of medications will be necessary.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  On
   levophed and vasopressin, vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**].
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed, neo, vasopressin and IVFs if
   necessary for goal MAP > 65
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
   - Maintain glucose < 180
    - continue hydrocort for now
    - Consider stress dose steroids, though patient was not hypotensive
   for > 1h.
    - will c/s surgery if lactate or WBC continues to increase despite
   antibiotics and IVFs
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h; pH goal 7.25
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
   - touch base with family
   #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent
   limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent placement.
   The stent continues to drain serosanguinous fluid.
    - RUQ U/S to eval for more distal areas of obstruction and touch base
   with IR afterward
   - F/U LFTs
    - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem; add cipro for pseudomonas double coverage
   given bile + pseudomonas and s aureus (sensities pnd)
    - would consider lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy given AMS overnight
   - t/[**Initials (NamePattern4) 8572**] [**Doctor First Name 91**] re surgical options
   - t/b w IR re replacing drain
   # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] and fellow
   met with patient on [**8-27**].  No role for chemo in this setting but would
   consider afteward.
   - Defer to Oncology for further management.
   - palliative care c/s
   # ARF:  The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from
   his baseline of 1.0.  Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe
   the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO
   intake) v. renal obstruction.  HD line placed on [**8-27**] and now on CVVH.
    - cont CVVH
    - Continue IVFs as needed to maintain MAP > 65
    - F/U renal recs.
    - Use D5W with 3 amps HCO3 if needed for IVFs.
    - renally dose meds
   # Hyperkalemia:  The patient had a K of 5.4 on admission to the ICU.
   ECG did not show evidence of peaked T waves.
    - recheck EKG as needed
    - Give Kayexelate if needed
   # DM2: Continue HISS while in hospital.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer who presented to the ICU with hypotension following extrahepatic drain placement. He has been diagnosed with sepsis likely secondary to biliary tree infection, hypoxic respiratory failure, biliary obstruction, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is being treated with multiple antibiotics, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. Surgical options have been discussed, but the patient is not considered a surgical candidate at this time. The patient's condition remains critical, and multiple organ dysfunction is present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to biliary tree infection. The infection may continue to worsen if not properly managed, leading to further systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. If the ventilator settings are not optimized or if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia, the patient's respiratory status may deteriorate.
3. Biliary Obstruction: The patient has tumor obstruction in the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis. This obstruction can lead to continued biliary stasis and further complications such as cholangitis or liver dysfunction.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who is currently experiencing biliary obstruction and has had a drain placed successfully. However, the patient has now developed sepsis with bacteria Staph and Pseudomonas found in the bile. The patient is intubated for hypoxemia and hypercarbia and is on multiple medications including levophed, neo, vaso, Zosyn, vancomycin, meropenem, and cipro. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 139/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 6,895 mL with an output of 4,757 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,138 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 90%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG)"

   optimizing PEEP and weaning FIO2 as able.  Continuing CVVH. IR to
   evaluate biliary drain as drainage has stopped.  Consider changing
   sedation to fent/versed from propofol.  Continue to update family as to
   pt status and address goals of care.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who presented with biliary obstruction and was found to have sepsis. He is currently intubated and on multiple pressors (vasopressin, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine) to maintain blood pressure. He also requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 65 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: 139/73 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 95%
- CVP: 3 mmHg

Laboratory results show hyperkalemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and altered kidney function. 

The patient's plan includes:
1. Biliary sepsis: Hydrocortisone, levo/neo/vaso, insulin, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.
2. ARDS: ARDSnet ventilation, goal pH >7.3, and goal PaO2 >60.
3. Biliary obx: Draining well, follow-up cultures.
4. ARF: CVVH, continue to correct acidosis, likely ATN.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  On
   levophed and vasopressin, vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**].
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed,  vasopressin and IVFs if
   necessary for goal MAP > 65
    - off neo
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem/cipro; f/u specificities for staph and
   pseudomonas
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
    - Maintain glucose < 180; insulin ggt
    - continue hydrocort for 5 days (today is day [**4-5**])
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - cont ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes
   - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h; pH goal 7.25
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
   - touch base with family
   #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent
   limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent placement.
   The stent continues to drain bilus  fluid. Defer replacement of drain
   for now given clinical acuity.
    -  F/U LFTs
    - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem; added cipro for pseudomonas double coverage
   given bile + pseudomonas and s aureus (sensities pnd)
    - touch base with micro lab as speciation not listed
    - would consider lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy given AMS overnight
   # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] and fellow
   met with patient on [**8-27**].  No role for chemo in this setting but would
   consider afteward.
   - Defer to Oncology for further management.
   - palliative care reccs
   # ARF:  The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from
   his baseline of 1.0.  Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe
   the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO
   intake) v. renal obstruction.  HD line placed on [**8-27**] and now on CVVH.
    - cont CVVH
    - Continue IVFs as needed to maintain MAP > 65
    - F/U renal reccs
    - renally dose meds
   # Hyperkalemia:  The patient had a K of 5.4 on admission to the ICU.
   ECG did not show evidence of peaked T waves.
    - recheck EKG as needed
    - CVVH
   # DM2: Continue HISS while in hospital.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who underwent Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension following extrahepatic drain placement. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, biliary obstruction, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is on vasopressin and levophed, indicating significant hypotension. There is ongoing concern for biliary tree infection, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Close monitoring of vital signs, lactate levels, and ABG is necessary to assess response to treatment.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to hypoxia secondary to volume overload. Current management includes ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes and daily weaning trials. Frequent assessment of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
3. Biliary obstruction: The patient has tumor-related obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis. Continued monitoring of liver function tests and consideration of further interventions, such as stent replacement, may be necessary.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from his baseline, indicating acute kidney injury. CVVH is currently being used, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  On
   levophed and vasopressin, vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**].
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed,  vasopressin and IVFs if
   necessary for goal MAP > 65
    - off neo
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem/cipro; f/u specificities for staph and
   pseudomonas
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
    - Maintain glucose < 180; insulin ggt
    - continue hydrocort for 5 days (today is day [**4-5**])
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - cont ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes
   - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h; pH goal 7.25
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
   - touch base with family
   #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent
   limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent placement.
   The stent continues to drain bilus  fluid. Defer replacement of drain
   for now given clinical acuity.
    -  F/U LFTs
    - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem; added cipro for pseudomonas double coverage
   given bile + pseudomonas and s aureus (sensities pnd)
    - touch base with micro lab as speciation not listed
    - would consider lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy given AMS overnight
   # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] and fellow
   met with patient on [**8-27**].  No role for chemo in this setting but would
   consider afteward.
   - Defer to Oncology for further management.
   - palliative care c/s
   # ARF:  The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from
   his baseline of 1.0.  Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe
   the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO
   intake) v. renal obstruction.  HD line placed on [**8-27**] and now on CVVH.
    - cont CVVH
    - Continue IVFs as needed to maintain MAP > 65
    - F/U renal reccs
    - renally dose meds
   # Hyperkalemia:  The patient had a K of 5.4 on admission to the ICU.
   ECG did not show evidence of peaked T waves.
    - recheck EKG as needed
    - CVVH
   # DM2: Continue HISS while in hospital.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who underwent Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension after extrahepatic drain placement. The patient has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis secondary to biliary tree infection. He is on vasopressin and levophed for hemodynamic support, and receiving vancomycin and meropenem for ESBL coverage. Stress dose steroids have been started.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for hypoxia likely due to volume overload in the setting of oliguria. He is currently on assisted mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes as part of the ARDS net protocol.
3. Biliary Obstruction: The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis. A stent has been placed, but the patient continues to drain bilus fluid. Replacement of the drain may be considered later.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level on admission was elevated from his baseline, suggesting acute kidney injury. Renal consultation has been obtained, and the patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer and biliary sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, anxiety, ineffective coping, acute renal failure, respiratory acidosis, hypotension, severe sepsis, and malignant neoplasm. The patient's vital signs are stable but he is sedated and paralyzed. His oxygen saturation is 92% on 60% FiO2. He has been on mechanical ventilation and pressors have been weaning off. His fluid balance shows an intake of 8,823 mL and output of 8,439 mL. His urine output is low at 95 mL. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high potassium levels, and signs of liver dysfunction. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has metabolic acidosis. The plan includes continuing antibiotics, weaning off FiO2 and PEEP, discussing goals of care, starting CVVH for acute renal failure, and increasing bowel regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is an issue with the mechanical ventilation or if the ARDS does not improve.
2. Hyperkalemia: The high potassium levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications if not managed properly.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The impaired renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with pancreatic cancer and biliary sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, anxiety, renal failure, acidosis, hypotension, sepsis, and cancer. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate in the 40s, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. He is on several medications and infusions, including vasopressin, fentanyl, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, midazolam, insulin, and potassium chloride. The patient also has ongoing issues with fluid balance, blood products, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a reduced tidal volume and increased PEEP. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to decreased urine output and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Acidosis: The patient has respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation, which can affect tissue oxygenation and metabolic processes.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating poor perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
6. Sepsis: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer who underwent Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension after extrahepatic drain placement. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, and is being treated for sepsis secondary to biliary tree infection. He also has acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and pancreatic cancer with metastasis. The patient is receiving CVVH for renal support and is on multiple medications to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for severe sepsis with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and organ function is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure requires close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and adherence to ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes. Frequent assessment of ABG and lactate levels is crucial to adjust ventilator settings and provide adequate oxygenation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and CVVH should be continued. Regular assessment of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and renal function tests is essential. Renal replacement therapy may be required if there is no"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer who underwent Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension after extrahepatic drain placement. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, renal failure, acidosis, hypotension, anxiety, and ineffective coping.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to biliary tree infection. He is currently being treated with vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage, and his vital signs should be closely monitored.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to volume overload. Continuous monitoring of blood gases and oxygenation is necessary. Low tidal volume ventilation should be continued as per ARDS net protocol.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which may require urgent intervention. CVVH and rechecking EKG as needed are recommended.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to [**2-2**] ATN or renal obstruction. CVVH should be continued, and renal dosing"

   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  On
   levophed and vasopressin, vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**].
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed,  vasopressin and IVFs if
   necessary for goal MAP > 65
    - off neo
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem/cipro; f/u specificities for staph and
   pseudomonas
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
    - Maintain glucose < 180; insulin ggt
    - continue hydrocort for 5 days (today is day [**4-5**])
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - cont ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes
   - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h; pH goal 7.25
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
   - touch base with family
   #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent
   limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent placement.
   The stent continues to drain bilus  fluid. Defer replacement of drain
   for now given clinical acuity.
    -  F/U LFTs
    - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem; added cipro for pseudomonas double coverage
   given bile + pseudomonas and s aureus (sensities pnd)
    - touch base with micro lab as speciation not listed
    - would consider lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy given AMS overnight
   # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] and fellow
   met with patient on [**8-27**].  No role for chemo in this setting but would
   consider afteward.
   - Defer to Oncology for further management.
   - palliative care reccs
   # ARF:  The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from
   his baseline of 1.0.  Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe
   the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO
   intake) v. renal obstruction.  HD line placed on [**8-27**] and now on CVVH.
    - cont CVVH
    - Continue IVFs as needed to maintain MAP > 65
    - F/U renal reccs
    - renally dose meds
   # Hyperkalemia:  The patient had a K of 5.4 on admission to the ICU.
   ECG did not show evidence of peaked T waves.
    - recheck EKG as needed
    - CVVH

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic cancer who presents with biliary obstruction and sepsis. The patient underwent a percutaneous procedure but continues to experience persistent septic shock. The patient also has respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, anxiety, ineffective coping, acute renal failure, respiratory acidosis, hypotension, severe sepsis, and malignancy.

The patient's prognosis remains poor due to both acute and subacute illness. The patient's current condition includes persistent infection in areas not being drained by the percutaneous tube, persistent septic shock despite adequate attempts at source control and broad antibiotics, and acute renal failure likely caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), for which continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) is being continued.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of new infections, and progression of the underlying malignancy. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging results to ensure early detection and management of any potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic cancer who presents with biliary obstruction and sepsis, following a percutaneous procedure. The patient is currently experiencing persistent septic shock, despite attempts at source control and broad antibiotic therapy. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing hypotension and organ dysfunction. The patient's prognosis is poor due to both acute and subacute illness. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, indicating respiratory failure.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Anxiety: The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history, suggesting potential anxiety related to the current medical situation.
5. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to respond to noxious stimuli and limited movement may indicate ineffective coping mechanisms.
6. Acidosis, respiratory: The patient has a decreased pH level, indicating respiratory acidosis.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating persistent hypotension.
8. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic infection that can lead to further complications.

   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  On
   levophed and Phenylephrine overnight, vanc/meropenem for ESBL
   coverage.  Started stress dose steroids on [**8-27**]. Also on empric PO
   vanco for c. diff coverage due to worsening leukocytosis.
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed and Neo and IVFs if necessary
   for goal MAP > 65
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem/cipro; f/u specificities for staph and
   pseudomonas
    - Continue PO vanco for c. diff empiric tx
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
    - Maintain glucose < 180; insulin ggt
    - continue hydrocort since continuing to have hypotension
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - cont ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes
   - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h; pH goal 7.25
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
    #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the
   afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent
   placement.  The stent continues to drain bilous  fluid. Defer
   replacement of drain for now given clinical acuity.
   -  F/U LFTs
   - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
   - Continue Vanc/meropenem; cipro for pseudomonas double coverage given
   bile GS had GNRs; follow up culture data
   - touch base with micro lab as speciation not listed
   - would consider lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy given AMS overnight
   - discuss with IR about exchange of biliary drain
    # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] and fellow
   met with patient on [**8-27**].  No role for chemo in this setting but would
   consider afteward.
   - Defer to Oncology for further management.
   - palliative care recs
   # ARF:  The patient's Cr on admission was 3.3, which is increased from
   his baseline of 1.0.  Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe
   the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO
   intake) v. renal obstruction.  HD line placed on [**8-27**] and now on CVVH.
    - cont CVVH, running even fluids for now
    - Continue IVFs as needed to maintain MAP > 65
    - F/U renal reccs

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who presented with hypotension after extrahepatic drain placement. He has been admitted to the MICU and is currently being treated for multiple medical conditions.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis secondary to a biliary tree infection. He is on vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage and also receiving stress dose steroids.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on August 27th for hypoxia due to volume overload in the setting of oliguria. He is currently on AC/CMV mode and receiving ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes. Lactate and ABG checks are being done every 4-6 hours with a pH goal of 7.25.

3. Biliary obstruction: The patient has a tumor obstructing the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis, which has been stented. The stent continues to drain bilious fluid, and further replacement of the drain may be considered at a later time.

4. Pancreatic cancer: The patient now has widespread metastasis. Oncology consultation has been arranged, and chemotherapy is not recommended in this setting. Palliative care recommendations are pending.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level on admission was"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who presented with hypotension after an extrahepatic drain placement. He has been in the MICU for respiratory failure and sepsis secondary to biliary tree infection. The patient is currently on multiple pressors, vasopressin, and receiving IV fluids. He is also on antibiotics for GNR coverage and empiric coverage for Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient has a history of pancreatic cancer with metastasis and underwent a Whipple procedure, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomis and had a stent placed. However, the stent continues to drain bilious fluid.

The patient's renal function is compromised, and he has acute renal failure with an increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.3. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and is also being monitored for hyperkalemia and hyponatremia.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is intubated and on assisted ventilation. He is being treated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure with low tidal volumes and daily ABG analysis.

   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to biliary tree infection.  On
   levophed and Phenylephrine overnight, vanc/meropenem for ESBL
   coverage.  Started stress dose steroids on [**8-27**]. Also on empric PO
   vanco for c. diff coverage due to worsening leukocytosis.
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed and Neo and IVFs if necessary
   for goal MAP > 65
    - Continue Vanc/meropenem/cipro; f/u specificities for staph and
   pseudomonas
    - Continue PO vanco for c. diff empiric tx
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
    - Maintain glucose < 180; insulin ggt
    - continue hydrocort since continuing to have hypotension
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - cont ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes
   - Check Lactate and ABG q4-6h; pH goal 7.25
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
    #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the
   afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent
   placement.  The stent continues to drain bilous  fluid. Defer
   replacement of drain for now given clinical acuity.
   -  F/U LFTs
   - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
   - Continue Vanc/meropenem; cipro for pseudomonas double coverage given
   bile GS had GNRs; follow up culture data

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer, who presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension after extrahepatic drain placement. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, anxiety, renal failure, acidosis, hypotension, sepsis, and cancer.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His blood pressure is being supported with phenylephrine and norepinephrine infusions. He is receiving vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for suspected biliary tree infection. Empiric coverage for Clostridium difficile is also being given due to worsening leukocytosis.

The patient's kidney function has deteriorated since admission, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.0 that increased to 2.0 on admission. He is currently undergoing continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). His sodium level is 132, which is stable, but he has resolved hyperkalemia with CVVH.

Other issues include ongoing biliary obstruction due to tumor involvement, ongoing drainage of bilious fluid from the stent, and the need for further evaluation of the infectious organism causing sepsis. The patient's pancreatic cancer is now widely metastatic, and"

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues.

1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis secondary to a biliary tree infection. He is currently being treated with vanc/meropenem for ESBL coverage and empiric PO vancomycin for Clostridium difficile coverage due to worsening leukocytosis.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria. He is currently on AC/CMV mode and following an ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes.

3. Biliary obstruction: The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis, which has been stented. The stent continues to drain bilious fluid. It is deferred for now due to the patient's clinical acuity.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, anxiety, ineffective coping, acute renal failure, acidosis, sepsis with organ dysfunction, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and multiorgan failure. The patient is receiving various treatments including CVVH, antibiotics, pressors, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may worsen, leading to further deterioration in lung function and difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or even cardiac arrest if not managed properly.
3. Anxiety: Untreated anxiety can increase the patient's stress levels, which may have negative effects on their overall well-being and recovery process.
4. Ineffective Coping: If the patient continues to experience ineffective coping strategies, it may hinder their ability to adapt to their critical illness and potentially delay recovery.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys may continue to deteriorate, leading to worsening renal function and the need for long-term dialysis or renal transplantation.
6. Acidosis: The patient's respiratory acidosis needs to be managed carefully to prevent further complications such as confusion, altered mental status, and increased risk of infections.
7. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially death if"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
   Acute renal failure. Continues to require CVVH.
 ANXIETY
   On versed, fentanyl
 INEFFECTIVE COPING: I have had a lengthy discussion with Mrs [**Known lastname 8549**]
   today to update regarding his current situation. He remains critically
   ill with increasing pressor need from presumed catheter infection (
   this has since been d/c
d). If we are to maximize pressors any further
   ( vasopressin, dopamine) without any further benefit, CPR will be of
   little value at that time and would amount to futile therapy in the
   setting of a PEA arrest. As such, we will not offer it in that clinical
   circumstance only. She has understood and wishes for all other heroic
   support to continue, which we will.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   On CVVH. Will need new catheter placed by IR when ready for travel.
 ACIDOSIS, RESPIRATORY
   On CVVH. And ACV, no need for PSV/ CPAP at this time
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   With worsening hypotension , requiring high doses of pressors,
   unresponsive to fluids Given elevated lactate, despite soft abdomen
   concerning for abdominal source given known collection, also
   potentially mesenteric ischemia, C.diff/megacolon. Line infection,
   especially femoral CVVH line of concern.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Options for further care limited given current severe multiorgan
   failure. Appreciate Oncology input. Appreciate palliative chemotherapy.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer, who presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension after extrahepatic drain placement. The patient has several medical complications including sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, biliary obstruction, renal failure, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient most likely has sepsis due to an infected hemodialysis (HD) line, which has been removed. He is currently on levophed overnight, and antibiotics have been started for gram-negative rods (GNRs) coverage.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [date] for hypoxia likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria. He is currently on assist-control/continuous mandatory ventilation (AC/CMV) mode with low tidal volumes.
3. Biliary obstruction: The patient has a tumor obstructing the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis, which was stented. The stent continues to drain bilious fluid, and a larger biliary drain will be planned.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.7. Hemodialysis (HD) was stopped due to an infected line, and the goal is to have the patient wake up and speak"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including cancer, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, sepsis, and hypotension. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been sedated. Laboratory results show abnormalities in various parameters, including elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal abnormalities in the chest X-ray. The patient's nutrition is being provided through an OG tube, which is currently on suction due to high residuals. The patient's family has been informed about the patient's condition and code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen due to the inability to wean off the ventilator.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to the need for dialysis. If not managed properly, there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to the presence of infection and systemic inflammatory response.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could indicate ongoing bleeding or a new source of infection, which needs to be identified and managed promptly.
5. Cancer Progression"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   # Hypotension: Currently on two pressors with low BP
s, low CVP, pt
   getting additional bolus. Metabolic acidosis on ABG appears worse,
   likely [**2-2**] infection. Given intermittently low pulse pressure, will
   evaluate for cardiogenic etiology.
   - Send cardiac enzymes, EKG
   - Check lytes
   - Plan to start additional pressor prn hypotension (likely vasopressin
   unless cardiac enzymes/EKG indicate coronary etiology)
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely due to infected HD line, now removed. On
   levophed and neosyn this am with low BP
s and tachycardia. On linezolid
   for VRE coverage. Continued meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**]. Also on empric PO vanco for c. diff
   coverage. Did not pass stool, so no c diff sample. WBC 39.4.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who underwent Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension following extrahepatic drain placement. The patient is currently intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and has multiple medical complications including hypotension, sepsis, infected HD line, hyponatremia, acute kidney injury, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently on two pressors with low blood pressure, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may require further evaluation and management.
2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to an infected HD line, which has been removed. He is receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage for VRE and ESBL organisms.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.7, indicating potential kidney injury. The HD line was stopped due to infection, and the goal is to have the patient wake up and speak to his sons.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low at 128, requiring monitoring and management.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2): The patient is on insulin gtt currently with well-controlled blood glucose levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension following extrahepatic drain placement. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is currently on two pressors with low blood pressure and low central venous pressure (CVP). The low pulse pressure may indicate a cardiogenic etiology, and cardiac enzymes and EKG have been ordered to evaluate this further. Vasopressin may be added as needed.

2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to an infected hemodialysis (HD) line, which has been removed. He is currently on levophed and neosynephrine with low blood pressure and tachycardia. Antibiotics have been started for coverage against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. Fungal coverage with micafungin will be started on [**9-3**].

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely secondary to volume overload. The PEEP will be increased to 8, and the patient will continue on assist-control/continuous mandatory ventilation (AC/CM"

   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   # Hypotension: Currently on two pressors with low BP
s, low CVP, pt
   getting additional bolus. Metabolic acidosis on ABG appears worse,
   likely [**2-2**] infection. Given intermittently low pulse pressure, will
   evaluate for cardiogenic etiology.
   - Send cardiac enzymes, EKG
   - Check lytes
   - Plan to start additional pressor prn hypotension (likely vasopressin
   unless cardiac enzymes/EKG indicate coronary etiology)
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely due to infected HD line, now removed. On
   levophed and neosyn this am with low BP
s and tachycardia. On linezolid
   for VRE coverage. Continued meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**]. Also on empric PO vanco for c. diff
   coverage. Did not pass stool, so no c diff sample. WBC 39.4.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer who underwent Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension after extrahepatic drain placement. The patient is currently on two pressors with low blood pressure, low central venous pressure (CVP), and intermittent low pulse pressure. There is also evidence of metabolic acidosis on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, which appears to worsen, likely due to infection. Cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram (EKG) are being sent to evaluate for cardiogenic etiology. 

The patient has sepsis, most likely due to an infected hemodialysis (HD) line, which has been removed. He is on vasopressor support with norepinephrine and neosynephrine for hypotension and tachycardia. Linezolid has been started for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) coverage, and meropenem for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) coverage. Stress dose steroids were initiated on [**8-27**]. The patient also has coverage for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) due to empric vancomycin therapy. His white blood cell count is elevated at 39.4.

   60 yo man with h/o pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple/chemo/XRT, who
   presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary
   anastamosis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension s/p
   extrahepatic drain placement.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely due to infected HD line, now removed. On
   levophed and neosyn this am with low BP
s and tachycardia. On linezolid
   for VRE coverage. Continued meropenem for ESBL coverage.  Started
   stress dose steroids on [**8-27**]. Also on empric PO vanco for c. diff
   coverage. Did not pass stool, so no c diff sample. WBC still 42.
    - Continue resuscitation with Levophed and IVF for goal MAP > 65
    - Continue Linezolid/meropenem/cipro for GNRs
    - Continue PO vanco for c. diff empiric tx
    - Monitor UOP for goal > 50 cc/h
    - Maintain glucose < 180; insulin ggt
    - wean hydrocort  to q8
    - Daily blood cultures
   -  F/U cultures: NGTD
   - When stable consider CT abd
   - RUQ u/s with ascites, but no pockets of fluid collection.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**8-27**] for hypoxia likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of oliguria.
   - AC/CMV for now
   - cont ARDS net protocol with low tidal volumes
   - Check Lactate and ABG daily; pH goal 7.25
   - once BP stabilizes, will remove fluid
    #. Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the
   afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent
   placement.  The stent continues to drain bilous  fluid. As more
   clinically stable, will change drain today
   -  F/U LFTs
   - Continue Hydroxyzine prn for itching
   - Continue linezolid/meropenem; cipro for pseudomonas double coverage
   given bile GS had GNRs; culture data negative for anaerobes
    - Plan for larger biliary drain when more stable
   # Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**] and fellow
   met with patient on [**8-27**].  No role for chemo in this setting but would

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who underwent Whipple surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
- He presented with afferent limb obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary anastomis and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension following extrahepatic drain placement.
- The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis most likely due to an infected hemodialysis line, hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, biliary obstruction, acute kidney injury (ARF), pancreatic cancer with metastasis, and hyponatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to an infected hemodialysis line. There is a risk of further infection if proper precautions are not taken.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate if not properly managed, leading to worsening hypoxia.
3. Biliary obstruction: The ongoing obstruction in the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastomosis may lead to further complications such as cholangitis or liver dysfunction.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's kidney function is impaired, which can result in further renal damage if not managed appropriately.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with metastatic pancreatic cancer, biliary sepsis, and respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and require continuous medical support. 

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. They have a low urine output and are receiving vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, as they are dependent on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. 

Laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and elevated lactate levels, suggesting multiorgan dysfunction. The patient has a high white blood cell count, likely due to ongoing infection. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions and a dilated esophagus, which may be related to their underlying malignancy.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including advanced pancreatic cancer, biliary sepsis, and respiratory failure. These conditions have led to significant organ dysfunction and the patient's current critical state. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and further deterioration of other organ functions."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on ventilator support and unable to wean due to multiorgan dysfunction and hemodynamic instability. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise and the need for continued ventilatory support.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has elevated serum lactate levels, hyperkalemia, and worsening renal function. This indicates possible renal dysfunction and the need for close monitoring and management.

3. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with unclear source. There is a risk of progression to septic shock and further organ dysfunction. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated promptly.

4. Candidemia: The patient has been started on micafungin to cover for candidemia. This indicates a potential fungal infection, which needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.

5. Malignancy: The patient has a history of malignancy, specifically pancreatic cancer. The dilated esophagus on CXR could be related to the cancer or associated complications.

6. Cardiac issues: The patient has a narrow pulse pressure and an EKG is planned to assess for any cardiac abnormalities. There is a risk of myocardial ischemia or other cardiac complications.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization and should be given prophylactic measures such as boots and sub"
