","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical history and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a widespread infection in the body. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, blood cultures, and response to antibiotics.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. Regular skin assessments and appropriate pressure relief measures should be implemented.

3. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT), upper extremity: The patient has a history of axillary DVT. Proper anticoagulation therapy should be continued, and the patient should be monitored for any signs of clot progression or pulmonary embolism.

4. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters, such as oxygen saturation, ventilation rates, and blood gases, is necessary. Weaning off mechanical ventilation should be considered when the patient's condition improves.

5. Hepatic hydrothorax: The patient has recurrent pleural effusions likely secondary to ascites. Continuous monitoring of chest tube output, regular chest X-rays, and follow-up with the liver transplant team are essential.

6. Leukocytosis and infection control: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia"

   transferred for transplant evaluation
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely multifactorial in setting of hydrothorax,
   secretions placing her at risk for mucous plugging, pre-existing
   axillary DVT leading to PE, re-expansion edema, possibly
   hepatopulmonary syndrome with orthodeoxia, aspiration etc. Given rapid
   improvement however most likely aspiration event
   -- Wean vent as possible, PaO2 goal > 65
   -- Would bronch this morning to evaluate left lower lobe, washings
   -- Hold heparin for bronch
   -- Decrease FIO2 today
   -- Would consult IP for possible pleurodesis
   -- Would defer CTA at this time given pt is already on heparin gtt, at
   risk of hepatic failure
   # SHOCK:: Acute increase in WBC post intubation with bandemia, DDx
   would also include aspiration with resulting inflammatory response,
   worsening underlying PNA, UTI, SBP, Bacteremia, C diff, etc. Also given
   acute rise would suspect aspiration with severe inflammatory response.
   - Levophed / Vasopressin titrate to goal MAP > 65 given poor toleration
   of levophed
   - ECHO for cardiac involvement of hemochromatosis
   - Vanc / Cefepime
   - Would add Flagyl

   - send blood, urine and stool c. diff
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Maintain MAPS > 60

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hemochromatosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and a previous TIPS procedure. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and shock. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in nature, hepatic hydrothorax, axillary DVT, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, and poor oral intake.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation due to underlying lung disease or infection. There is also a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.

2. Hepatic Hydrothorax: The patient may continue to have recurrent pleural effusions, which can lead to respiratory distress and infection if not properly managed.

3. Axillary DVT: The patient may develop a pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the existing axillary DVT. Anticoagulation therapy is essential to prevent clot propagation or dislodgement.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she experiences ongoing blood loss or if her underlying condition exacerbates. Transfusion may be required to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may progress if the underlying cause, such as diuretic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of hemochromatosis and resultant cirrhosis. She underwent a TIPS procedure on [**2154-1-13**] for hydrothorax, but it was complicated by post-TIPS encephalopathy. The patient was admitted to OSH on [**1-19**] and had a hospital course notable for respiratory failure due to hydrothorax and subsequent chest tube drainage and diuresis. She was intubated until [**1-30**] and also had C diff, VRE bacteremia, axillary DVT, and SVT. She was transferred overnight for liver transplant evaluation and was initially clinically stable.

24-hour events include the development of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure unresponsive to NRB ventilation, leading to intubation. The patient also experienced progressive hypotension unresponsive to 50g albumin and NS boluses, prompting the initiation of Levophed and vasopressin. The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and pressors were changed to vasopressin and phenylephrine. An arterial line was placed.

The patient's allergies include a last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone on [**2154-2-7**] 02:45 AM, and cefipime on [**2154-2-7**] 07:32 AM. Current infusions include propofol, vasopressin, heparin sodium, and phenylephrine. Other medications administered include morphine sulfate, omeprazole, tamoxifen, Peridex, vancomycin, among others.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart rate: 68 bpm (65-111 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 98/46 mmHg (64/75 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (16-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on FiO2 50%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds bilaterally, right chest tube site checked, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, no distention or fluid wave, and right lower extremity edema of 1+, left lower extremity edema of 1+. The patient is sedated and not assessed for neurologic status.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 11.4 K/uL
- Platelet count: 227 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 95 mg/dL

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of hemochromatosis and resultant cirrhosis who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure for hepatic hydrothorax. She has had a complicated hospital course, including respiratory failure due to hydrothorax, intubation, chest tube drainage, diuresis, Clostridium difficile infection, vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia, axillary deep vein thrombosis, and supraventricular tachycardia. She was transferred to the current hospital for liver transplant evaluation and was initially clinically stable. However, overnight she developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure unresponsive to nonrebreather ventilation, progressive hypotension unresponsive to albumin and normal saline boluses, and required the initiation of vasopressor support with levophed and vasopressin. She also developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and her pressors were changed to vasopressin and phenylephrine. A central venous line was placed.

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. She has been receiving multiple medications, including propofol, vasopressin, heparin sodium, phenylephrine, and others. Her vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. She has diminished breath sounds bilaterally and right"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hemochromatosis, and hepatic encephalopathy who was admitted for a liver transplant evaluation. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, DVT, and shock. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and receiving antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration or mucous plugging. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the patient develops pneumonia or experiences another aspiration event.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a pre-existing axillary DVT. There is a risk of clot propagation or new clot formation, potentially leading to pulmonary embolism.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest and possibly pressure ulcers. This increases the risk of infection.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by factors such as gastrointestinal bleeding or infections.

5. Liver transplant complications: As the patient is being evaluated for liver transplantation, there is a risk of complications related to the procedure, such as rejection or surgical site infections.

6. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to diuresis with Lasix. Close monitoring and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, hemochromatosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and a previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and potential liver transplant evaluation. She has had recent complications including recurrent ascites, pleural effusions, and hepatic encephalopathy following the TIPS procedure. She is also experiencing hepatic hydrothorax, axillary DVT, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, and poor oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure due to factors such as mucous plugging, re-expansion edema, hepatopulmonary syndrome, aspiration, and possible pleural effusions.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. There is a concern for worsening infection leading to septic shock.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to immobility and pressure ulcers.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in the upper extremity and is currently on heparin gtt. There is a risk for further clot formation or extension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis, complicated by hepatic hydrothorax and encephalopathy after TIPS placement. She has experienced a complicated OSH course and is currently facing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been intubated. She has an active infection in her urine and is showing signs of candidal UTI. She also has a history of cirrhosis with encephalopathy and hydrothorax. The patient's condition requires continuous monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: This condition can be caused by underlying effusion, superimposed pneumonia, or acute lobar collapse. The patient's respiratory status will need to be closely monitored, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation with weaning of FiO2 for a goal PaO2 of >60. Bronchodilators may be used, and BAL studies are pending.
2. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which can have various causes such as septic shock (from sources like pulmonary, urinary, gastrointestinal, or Clostridium difficile), cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. Antibiotics (linezolid and cefepime) will be continued, and panculture studies are pending. Hydrocortisone will be administered due to failed [Last Name (un) 402] stim test. Other measures include the administration of 1u PRBC for oncotic pressure/volume given low CVP and marginal UOP, and an echo will be performed.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis with associated encephalopathy and hydrothorax. Treatment will involve continuing lactulose and holding diuretics and Lasix due to the shock state. Follow-up RUQ ultrasound and possible TIPS revision if the shunt is small will be considered. Trends in LFTs and coags will also be monitored.
4. Axillary DVT: The patient has an axillary DVT, and systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt will be continued.
5. Candidal UTI: The patient has a candidal UTI, and Foley catheter change will be performed.

ICU Care:
The patient's ICU care will involve nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management (arterial line and multi-lumen line). Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis with boots and systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 45 minutes."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis, complicated by hepatic hydrothorax and subsequent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement resulting in encephalopathy. She has also had a complicated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OSH) course. Currently, the active issues include acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: This condition can be caused by underlying effusion, possible superimposed pneumonia (PNA), or a plug/acute lobar collapse. The patient requires mechanical ventilation, and FiO2 should be weaned for a goal PaO2 of greater than 60. Spontaneous breathing capacity will be assessed today, and bronchodilators were administered yesterday. BAL studies are pending.

2. Shock: The patient's shock could be due to septic shock (with potential sources including the lungs, urine, gastrointestinal tract, and Clostridium difficile infection), cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient is currently receiving linezolid and cefepime antibiotics, and pan-culture studies (including BAL, sputum, urine, blood, and C. difficile) are pending. Hydrocortisone has been started due to failed [**Last"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: history of breast cancer, hemochromatosis, hepatic
   encephalopathy, s/p TIPS [**2154-1-13**], hepatic hydrothorax who is
   transferred for transplant evaluation
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Resolved now, successful extubation. Likely
   multifactorial in setting of hydrothorax, secretions placing her at
   risk for mucous plugging, pre-existing axillary DVT leading to PE,
   re-expansion edema, possibly hepatopulmonary syndrome with orthodeoxia,
   aspiration etc. Given rapid improvement however most likely aspiration
   event and/or plugging.   Bronch unrevealing.
   -- Would consult IP for possible pleurodesis
   -- Continue antibiotics as below
   -- Continue heparin gtt for RUE DVT
   -- Would not pursue CTA for PE eval at this time given prompt
   improvement in respiratory status
   -- Aspiration precautions, would consider swallow eval
   # SHOCK:: Currently resolving with broad spectrum antibiotics and
   stress dose sterodis. Acute increase in WBC post intubation with
   bandemia, Now significantly improved. ECHO hyperdynamic without clear
   constriction from infiltration. Able to wean vasopressin overnight
   --Continue hydrocort 50mg q6 given low cortisol, positive [**Last Name (un) 402**]-stim

   - follow up culture data
   - Dicated RUQ U/S negative, stopped flagyl
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Consider IR guided para if ascites on abdominal  ultrasound
   # Hemochromatosis: Pt with MELD score of 9. She was diagnosed with
   hemochromatosis in [**11-12**] and has been stable. However, her course has
   recently been complicated by recurrent ascites, pleural effusions and
   hepatic encephalopathy following TIPS procedure. She is being
   transferred for liver transplant eval. Currently no evidence of
   encephalopathy or asterexsis. Pt is requiring blood transfusions for
   oncotic pressure support however and is therefore receiving futher iron

   secondary from ascites.  She underwent chest tube placement at OSH and
   has been draining 500cc per day.  Cultures at OSH negative and no
   evidence of infection. Given patent TIPS, unclear etiology of hepatic

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hemochromatosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and a previous TIPS procedure. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and was intubated. The patient underwent successful extubation and is now on non-invasive ventilation. She has a past medical history of recurrent ascites, pleural effusions, and hepatic encephalopathy following the TIPS procedure. The patient is being evaluated for liver transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which has now resolved after being extubated. The cause of respiratory failure could be multifactorial, including hydrothorax, secretions leading to mucous plugging, pre-existing axillary DVT leading to pulmonary embolism (PE), re-expansion edema, hepatopulmonary syndrome, or aspiration.

2. Shock: The patient showed signs of shock, which has now improved with broad-spectrum antibiotics, stress-dose steroids, and vasopressin. The improvement in the patient's condition may be attributed to the treatment of sepsis or an appropriate response to the medications.

3. Hemochromatosis: The patient has a history of hemochromatosis and is being evaluated for liver transplantation due to a MELD score of 9. She has experienced recurrent ascites, pleural effusions, and hep"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: history of breast cancer, hemochromatosis, hepatic
   encephalopathy, s/p TIPS [**2154-1-13**], hepatic hydrothorax who is
   transferred for transplant evaluation
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Resolved now, successful extubation. Likely
   multifactorial in setting of hydrothorax, secretions placing her at
   risk for mucous plugging, pre-existing axillary DVT leading to PE,
   re-expansion edema, possibly hepatopulmonary syndrome with orthodeoxia,
   aspiration etc. Given rapid improvement however most likely aspiration
   event and/or plugging.   Bronch unrevealing.
   -- Continue antibiotics as below
   -- Continue heparin gtt for RUE DVT
   -- Would not pursue CTA for PE eval at this time given prompt
   improvement in respiratory status
   -- Aspiration precautions, would consider swallow eval
   --will plan to keep chest tube in until cultures return negative
   # SHOCK:: Currently resolving with broad spectrum antibiotics and
   stress dose sterodis. Acute increase in WBC post intubation with
   bandemia, Now significantly improved. ECHO hyperdynamic without clear
   constriction from infiltration. Able to wean vasopressin overnight
   --Continue hydrocort 50mg q6 given low cortisol, positive [**Last Name (un) 402**]-stim
   - Continue Linezolid (given h/o VRE bacteremia) / Cefepime /Flagyl
   - follow up culture data
   - RUQ negative
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   # Hemochromatosis: Pt with MELD score of 9. She was diagnosed with
   hemochromatosis in [**11-12**] and has been stable. However, her course has
   recently been complicated by recurrent ascites, pleural effusions and
   hepatic encephalopathy following TIPS procedure. She is being
   transferred for liver transplant eval. Currently no evidence of
   encephalopathy or asterexsis. Pt is requiring blood transfusions for
   oncotic pressure support however and is therefore receiving futher iron
   load.
   - f/u with Liver team recs
   - RUQ US for TIPS patency final read
   - lactulose TID titrated to 3 BM per day
   - Nutrition consult pending
   - no chelation per liver team
   .
   #. Hepatic Hydrothorax: Pt with recurent pleural effusions likely
   secondary from ascites.  She underwent chest tube placement at OSH and
   has been draining 500cc per day.  Cultures at OSH negative and no
   evidence of infection. Given patent TIPS, unclear etiology of hepatic
   hydrothorax, will need to entertain infectious vs malignant process as
   well
   - Ongoing drainage
   - consider thoracics consult for pleurodesis
   - f/u cytology
   .
   #. Axially DVT: Pt with axillary DVT at OSH. Although no radiology
   report. Pt was on heparin at OSH.  Will plan to continue for now.
   - cont heparin gtt
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 4725**] regarding radiology report
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt with Hct 26.1, up from OSH of 24. No evidence of active
   bleeding, but on heparin gtt. s/p total 3Uprbcs
   - cont to monitor Hct q12
   - T&S
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis: Pt with bicarb of 38. Possibly from diuresis
   with lasix at OSH.  Has trended up over the last few days.
   - cont to trend

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hemochromatosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and a previous TIPS procedure. The patient was admitted with respiratory distress and required invasive ventilation. The patient's condition improved rapidly, and she was successfully extubated.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, which resolved after extubation. The possible causes of respiratory failure include hydrothorax, secretions leading to mucous plugging, pre-existing axillary deep vein thrombosis (DVT) leading to pulmonary embolism (PE), re-expansion edema, hepatopulmonary syndrome with orthodeoxia, and aspiration.

2. Shock: The patient presented with shock, which improved with broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids. The patient had an acute increase in white blood cell count following intubation, along with bandemia. The echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic function without clear constriction from infiltration. The patient was able to wean off vasopressin overnight.

3. Hemochromatosis: The patient has a history of hemochromatosis and a MELD score of 9. She has been stable but recently experienced recurrent ascites, pleural effusions, and hepatic encephalopathy after the TIPS procedure. The patient is being transferred for liver transplant evaluation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis, complicated by hepatic hydrothorax and subsequent TIPS procedure resulting in encephalopathy. She is currently experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: This could be due to underlying effusion, possible superimposed pneumonia, or acute lobar collapse. The patient has been extubated and is stable on 2 liters of oxygen, but further diagnostic tests such as bronchoscopy and BAL studies are pending. Antibiotics have been started.
2. Shock: The cause of shock is uncertain but could include septic shock from various sources like the lungs, urine, gastrointestinal tract, or Clostridium difficile infection. Cardiogenic shock and adrenal insufficiency should also be considered. The patient is receiving continuous linezolid and cefepime, along with a panculture. Hydrocortisone has been initiated due to failed stress dose steroid trial, and an echo looked reasonable.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis with associated encephalopathy and hydrothorax. Lactulose is being continued, and diuretics like Aldactone and Lasix have been withheld in the shock state. Further evaluation with RUQ ultrasound and possible TIPS revision if the shunt is small is planned"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis, who is currently experiencing hepatic hydrothorax and encephalopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She has undergone TIPS surgery and has a history of complicated obstructive shock. Active issues include acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, shock, and cirrhosis with encephalopathy and hydrothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can be caused by underlying effusion, possible pneumonia, or a plug/acute lobar collapse. She has been treated empirically with cefepime and linezolid for suspected pneumonia. If cultures are negative, she may be considered for extubation and a 5-day course of antibiotics.

2. Shock: The patient is also experiencing shock, which can have various causes such as septic shock (pulmonary, urinary, gastrointestinal, Clostridium difficile), cardiogenic, or adrenal insufficiency. She has been receiving continuous linezolid and cefepime, and her cultures have been negative. She has also failed a [Last Name (un)] stim test, leading to the administration of hydrocortisone every six hours. An echo looked reasonable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis, complicated by hepatic hydrothorax and TIPS placement. She is currently experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, shock, and other medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is showing signs of respiratory distress and requires supplemental oxygen. The differential diagnosis includes underlying effusion, possible pneumonia (PNA), or a plug/acute lobar collapse. She has been treated empirically with cefepime and linezolid, and plans for a 5-day course of antibiotics are in place. Pleural effusion is suspected, and fluid analysis is pending. If infection is ruled out, the patient may undergo a CT scan.

2. Shock: The patient is exhibiting signs of shock, which could be due to septic shock or other causes such as cardiogenic or adrenal insufficiency. Cultures have come back negative, and the patient has been started on hydrocortisone due to failed [Last Name (un) 402] stim.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis with associated encephalopathy and hydrothorax. Treatment includes lactulose for encephalopathy, and diuretics (Aldactone and Lasix) have been withheld due to the shock state. Follow-up with RUQ ultrasound and possible TIPS revision if necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis, who presented with hepatic hydrothorax and underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. She developed encephalopathy post-TIPS. The patient has had a complicated course of obstructive shock, including septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and adrenal insufficiency. She is currently experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to underlying effusion, superimposed pneumonia, or a plug/acute lobar collapse. The patient was extubated yesterday and is stable on 2 liters of oxygen. She underwent bronchoscopy two days ago, and BAL studies are pending. She has been empirically treated with cefepime and linezolid for possible pneumonia and de-escalation of antibiotics if cultures are negative. The pleural effusion is likely hepatic hydrothorax, but fluid will be sent for analysis, and cultures and cytology are pending. Once infection is ruled out, the patient may be able to have a CT scan. The patient also has a hoarse voice/lost voice after extubation, and if not better in 24-48 hours, she should have an ENT evaluation to assess her vocal cords.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis, who has undergone TIPS procedure and developed hepatic encephalopathy. She has had a complicated course of out-of-hospital syncopal episode (OSH) and is currently experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, shock, and complications related to cirrhosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and there are multiple potential causes including underlying effusion, superimposed pneumonia, or acute lobar collapse. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, with plans to wean FiO2 for a goal PaO2 of greater than 60. Assessment of spontaneous breathing capacity today may allow for possible extubation. Bronchoscopy and BAL studies are pending.
2. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which could be due to septic shock from sources such as the lungs, urine, gastrointestinal tract, or Clostridium difficile infection. Cardiogenic or adrenal insufficiency causes of shock should also be considered. Antibiotics (linezolid and cefepime) are being continued, along with pan-culture studies. Hydrocortisone is being administered every six hours due to failed ACTH stimulation test. An echocardiogram looked reasonable, and one unit of packed red blood cells has been given for oncotic pressure/volume support.
