   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely AMI given enzymes still up and likely short (relatively for
   myocardium) hypoxia. Likely STEMI. Possibly followed by VF arrest. PE
   unlikely based on echo and presentation, EKG, enzymes.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   - obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   - follow cardiac biomarkers
   - Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   Mental Status
   No evidence of sensory evoked potenials. Areflexia likely due to
   paralysis or, less likely,
spinal shock
. Sedation may also be
   responsible for lack of EEG activity. Will keep paralytics off and wean
   sedation as warming today to further evaluate neurologic status. Will
   need more time to prognosticate.
   - Neurologic exam this afternoon after paralytics off for longer and
   sedation weaned
   - Appeciate Neurology input
   - Rewarm and continue EEG monitoring
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Drawing large tidal volumes
   prior to paralysis. Paralytics kept on to facilitate mechanical
   ventilation. Found to have unclear opacities on CXR which may be blood,
   sputum, or edema.
   - ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   - continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   - Q 6 mouth care
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   - continue nitro gtt as needed
   - 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking POs
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA
   - f/u culture
   - continue unasyn as above
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place but will be NPO while on paralytics
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest. He required defibrillation twice and had ST elevations on the EKG by EMS and OSH. The patient was transferred for further management and found to have resolution of ST elevations but a poor neurological exam. He is currently on a cooling protocol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) arrest: The patient had a VF arrest during his initial presentation, which required defibrillation. There is a possibility of recurrent VF arrest due to ongoing ischemia or other cardiac issues.
2. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): Given the patient's presentation and elevated cardiac enzymes, there is a likelihood of an AMI. Further evaluation with serial EKGs and cardiac biomarkers is necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The presence of unclear opacities on the chest X-ray raises concerns about pneumonia.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis shows moderate bacteria, suggesting a UTI. Follow-up culture and continuation of antibiotics are required.
5. Hypertension: The patient presented with high blood pressure above 250, which needs to be managed to prevent cerebral ischemia or infarction.
6. Neurological impairment: The patient's"

   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on

   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   .
   * Cardiac Arrest:  Differential diagnosis for sudden arrest includes
   MI, massive PE, cardiac tampenade, arrhythmia, metabolic derrangement,
   toxicosis.  Given ST elevations in inferior distribution on EKGs by EMS
   and elevated CKMB, MI causing V fib arrest seems most likely etiology.
   PE causing PEA arrest and subsequent hypoperfusion leading to V fib
   aslo a possibility, but lack of right heart strain on echo does not
   support this.
   -- Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   -- obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   -- follow cardiac biomarkers

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest that required defibrillation twice. He had ST elevations on the EKG by EMS and OSH, which indicated a possible myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was transferred for further management and found to have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam. He was initiated on a cooling protocol.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypotension requiring vasopressor support and low cardiac output. There have been concerns about possible infections, including a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia (CAP). The patient has also shown signs of acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated serum creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which could be due to various causes such as MI, massive pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac tamponade, arrhythmia, metabolic derangement, or toxicosis. Continued monitoring and further investigation are necessary to determine the exact cause.
2. Infection: The patient has shown signs of infection, including a UTI and possible CAP. Cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics have been started. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is crucial.
3. Neurological Impairment: The patient has a poor neurological exam, indicating possible brain injury or hypoxic damage. Continued EEG monitoring and evaluation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is cardiorespiratory arrest with subsequent cardiac enzyme leak. The patient is currently undergoing a cooling protocol. 

The 24-hour events include the initiation of a multi-lumen femoral line, which showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% and had a heart attack involving the inferior free and posterior walls. Antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone/azithromycin to cover for possible CAP, UTI, and aspiration. The patient experienced a drop in blood pressure to the 80s systolic/map in the 50s, leading to the placement of a central venous line (CLV) and the administration of low-dose dopamine. The electrocardiogram (ECG) remained unchanged, and the patient received 2 liters of normal saline with subsequent hemodynamic improvement. The patient's PaO2 dropped into the 50s from the 100s, prompting a stat chest X-ray that looked better, an increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and a repeated blood gas that confirmed PaO2 in the 100s, suggesting a spurious value.

Allergies are noted as vancomycin, ampicillin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone, with the last doses administered on 05/30/2156.

Infusions include dopamine at 3 mcg/kg/min, midazolam (V"

   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely AMI given enzymes still up and likely short (relatively for
   myocardium) hypoxia. Likely STEMI. Possibly followed by VF arrest. PE
   unlikely based on echo and presentation, EKG, enzymes.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   - obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   - follow cardiac biomarkers
   - Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   Mental Status
   No evidence of sensory evoked potenials. Areflexia likely due to
   paralysis or, less likely,
spinal shock
. Sedation may also be
   responsible for lack of EEG activity. Will keep paralytics off and wean
   sedation as warming today to further evaluate neurologic status.
   - Neurologic exam this afternoon after paralytics off for longer and
   sedation weaned
   - Appeciate Neurology input
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Drawing large tidal volumes
   prior to paralysis. Paralytics kept on to facilitate mechanical
   ventilation. Found to have unclear opacities on CXR which may be blood,
   sputum, or edema.
   - ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   - continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   - Q 6 mouth care
   .
   * Hypertension: Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250.
   Has known hypertension, per wife but not on any antihypertensive
   medications at home.  Unusual to have hypertension in the setting of
   MI, but may have increased catecholamines after resucitation.
   -- continue nitro gtt as needed
   -- 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   -- will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under
   better control and taking POs
   .
   * Neurologic unresponsiveness:  Found to have decorticate posturing at
   OSH.  Did not have pupillary or gag reflexes in ED.
   -- continue cooling protocol with 48 hr EEG

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice, ST elevations on EKG, and poor neurological exam. The patient was transferred for further management and initiated on a cooling protocol due to the cardiac arrest. The patient likely had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with a possible ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's initial presentation showed resolution of ST elevations but with ongoing cardiac enzyme leak. The patient also had an unresponsive mental status, hypertension, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the history of cardiac arrest and ongoing cardiac enzyme leak, there is a possibility of cardiogenic shock.
2. Neurological deficits: The patient's poor neurological exam and unresponsiveness raise concerns for potential neurological deficits or brain injury.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels and low urine output may indicate AKI, which can occur due to hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest or as a result of sepsis.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for several days, there is a risk of developing VAP.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics turned off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - decreased sedation and warmed
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV q 6 h, but held early am doses
   due to hypotension
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan

   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - monitor BP,
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down.  Fena/FeUrea was prerenal, however
   clearly also obstructed and possible UTI.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice and ST elevation on EKG by EMS. He was transferred for further management and found to have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam. The patient has been initiated on a cooling protocol and is now approximately 64 hours post-arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Deficits: The patient still shows neurological deficits despite re-warming and weaning off paralytics. Continuous EEG has been completed, and neurology input is appreciated for prognostication as the patient reaches 72 hours post-arrest.

2. Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for airway protection, the patient did well on pressure support yesterday but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with respiratory compensation. He was rested on AC overnight. A chest x-ray showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation. The plan is to try pressure support again today and attempt spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for possible extubation.

3. Hypertension: The patient came to the floor with blood pressures above 250, which may be due to cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent with posturing and pharmacologic/catecholaminergic effects. Nitro gtt was initially started but weaned, and dopamine was given for a short time. The plan is to stop lopressor IV while"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics turned off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - decreased sedation and warmed
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV q 6 h, but held early am doses
   due to hypotension
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation

   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos

   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down.  Fena/FeUrea was prerenal, however
   clearly also obstructed and possible UTI.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:

 CARDIAC ARREST
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice, ST elevations on EKG by EMS, and transfer to the hospital. He was initiated on a cooling protocol and is now approximately 64 hours post-arrest. The patient's neurological exam shows deficits, and he has been rewarmed. He continues to have poor mental status with ongoing neurological deficits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiorespiratory Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, likely due to a myocardial infarction causing ventricular fibrillation (vfib), possibly a STEMI, although the elevations resolved by the time he reached the hospital. He is currently in the ICU, and cardiac biomarkers are trending down.
2. Mental Status/Neurological Deficits: The patient's mental status is still poor, with ongoing neurological deficits despite rewarming and discontinuation of paralytics. A continuous EEG has been completed, and neurology input is required for prognostication.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated for airway protection. He did well on pressure support yesterday but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with respiratory compensation. He was rested on AC overnight. A chest x-ray showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation. Pressure support will be tried again today, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted for possible extub"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Warming completed slightly early - patient's thermogenesis took off
   at about 36 degrees.
   - Started to decrease sedation while warming
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV (still ileus s/p paralytics) and
   decided to start q6h for now. Increase or start oral depending on
   subsequent events.
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Repeat ABG on PSV
   - Neurology have not left a note, unclear if formally following - will
   be able to prognosticate better tomorrow, so will call them early in
   the a.m.
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - heparin gtt until can go to catheterization, pending neuro recovery
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   - follow cardiac biomarkers (CKMB peaked, troponin trending down
   overall)
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr complete
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees

   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was weaned.
   - 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr while NPO
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice, ST elevations on EKG by EMS, and transfer for further management. The patient was found to have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam. He was initiated on a cooling protocol and is now approximately 64 hours post-arrest.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - listen for bowel sounds and when present initiate PO
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -Pain management with fentanyl
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

- The patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice, with ST elevations on EKG by EMS and OSH. The ST elevations resolved by the time he reached the hospital, but he has a poor neurological exam.
- The patient was initiated on a cooling protocol.
- The patient's current condition includes mental status deficits, intubation for respiratory failure, hypertension, possible urinary tract infection, low urine output, and an ongoing Foley catheter obstruction.
- The patient has been rewarmed and paralytics have been turned off.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.7°C, heart rate 74 bpm, blood pressure 94/49 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac biomarkers, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The plan includes continuing aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin, stopping heparin due to decreasing cardiac biomarkers, performing an EKG and monitoring on telemetry, mental status assessment, intubation weaning, hypertension management, UTI management, low urine output management, and Foley catheter replacement.

   24 Hour Events:
   - sedation weaned and evaluated by neuro who were encouraged by
   spontaneous movements, downgoing babinsky, followed simple command of
   raising leg, eeg showed alpha waves
   - sats dropped so got CXR which shows worsening opacities on right, but
   sats improved when better sedated (thought to be from struggling
   against machine)
   -neuro recommended head CT and take it day by day with neuro exams
   - restarted on propofol after neuro evaluation for sedation and
   hypertension
   - Head CT preliminarily showed no acute infarction
   - started on tube feeds
   - pm crit stable
   - 4 am, decreasing sats to high 80s, thick secretions, temp 100 po,
   worsening CXR earlier so --> started on vanc/zosyn for aspiration
   - was found to be autopeeping, which resolved with CPAP and increased
   propofol to 60 mg(also abg O2 better than pleth sats)
   - this am had RSBI despite sedation and was 40 on pressure support

   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation. He had ST elevations on EKG but they resolved by the time he reached the hospital. He is now approximately 64 hours post-arrest and has been through various interventions including cooling, sedation weaning, and neurological evaluations. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypertension, potential urinary tract infection (UTI), acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, and feeding issues. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving antibiotics and other medications. His vital signs are relatively stable but there are concerns about potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up tests are being implemented to reduce the risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin is being administered to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and medications. Prophylactic H2 blocker (famotidine) is being given to prevent stress ulcers.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creat"

   24 Hour Events:
   - sedation weaned and evaluated by neuro who were encouraged by
   spontaneous movements, downgoing babinsky, followed simple command of
   raising leg, eeg showed alpha waves
   - sats dropped so got CXR which shows worsening opacities on right, but
   sats improved when better sedated (thought to be from struggling

   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
 they would like head MRI (likely with
   DWI)
 their impression was some worsening today
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop ceftriaxone, but continue azithromycin would have been/is D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   - Given good gas on PSV and likely lying down (due to fem line) cause
   of PSV 5/10 needed, could likely extubate, but will need to perform
   sedated MRI first, then get PICC, pull femoral line
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned. Pressure ideally
   should be in 150s or so post-cardiac arrest, but the benefit of this is
   likely no longer present
 will therefore aim for normal range.
   - stop lopressor IV while giving propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal normotension, systolics 100-140, with MAP > 65
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   - Spin urine to look for cast and red cells
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds. Should be reversible
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice. The patient had ST elevations on EKG by EMS and OSH, but these resolved before reaching the hospital. He was found to have poor neurological examination and was initiated on a cooling protocol. The patient's cardiac arrest is likely due to a myocardial infarction (MI) causing ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, possibly a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), although the elevations resolved by the time he reached the hospital.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Mental Status: The patient's neurologic status is evolving, with restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours. The prognosis is indeterminate, and the patient's neurologic evaluation continues to evolve. An MRI is recommended to assess for any cerebral ischemia or infarction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated for airway protection. He did well on pressure support with essentially normal gas exchange. There is a concern for aspiration and pneumonia (PNA), so he is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn. The plan is to continue pressure support and attempt a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for possible extubation. An arterial blood gas (ABG) will be monitored early this afternoon.

   Imaging:
   Head CT without gross edema, some periventricular white matter disease
   and cerebral atrophy, but no clear acute infarction. No bleed.
   CXR Some edema and concern for retrocardiac opacity, but no other lobar
   consolidation.
   Microbiology: Sputum: 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters.
   Blood and urine: Pending. No growth so far from [**5-29**] onward.
   ECG: No new this a.m. Q-waves in inferior distribution that correlate
   with echo. ST segment changes, peri-arrest have resolved.
   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
 they would like head MRI (likely with
   DWI)
 their impression was some worsening today
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop ceftriaxone, but continue azithromycin would have been/is D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   - Given good gas on PSV and likely lying down (due to fem line) cause
   of PSV 5/10 needed, could likely extubate, but will need to perform
   sedated MRI first, then get PICC, pull femoral line
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned. Pressure ideally
   should be in 150s or so post-cardiac arrest, but the benefit of this is
   likely no longer present
 will therefore aim for normal range.
   - stop lopressor IV while giving propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal normotension, systolics 100-140, with MAP > 65
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   - Spin urine to look for cast and red cells
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds. Should be reversible
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice. He had ST elevations on EKG but these resolved by the time he reached the hospital. He is currently in the ICU for further management due to poor neurological exam. The patient's neurologic status continues to evolve, and a head MRI with DWI is planned as suggested by Neurology. He has been initiated on a cooling protocol.

The patient's current plan includes continuing aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin, stopping heparin gtt, monitoring on telemetry, maintaining electrolytes, and monitoring neurological progress. Intubation and respiratory failure are also being managed, and there are concerns about aspiration and pneumonia, so he is on vancomycin and Zosyn. Pressure support has been helpful, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be attempted for possible extubation. Hypertension is being managed with medication adjustments.

Other issues include a urinary tract infection (UTI) with moderate bacteria seen on urine analysis but no growth in cultures, low urine output possibly related to pre-renal azotemia or obstructive nephropathy, acute kidney injury (ARF) with stable creatinine levels, anemia possibly due to bleeding or IVF administration, and feeding issues being addressed with a nutrition consult.

   24 Hour Events:
   - sedation weaned and evaluated by neuro who were encouraged by
   spontaneous movements, downgoing babinsky, followed simple command of
   raising leg, eeg showed alpha waves
   - sats dropped so got CXR which shows worsening opacities on right, but
   sats improved when better sedated (thought to be from struggling
   against machine)
   -neuro recommended head CT and take it day by day with neuro exams
   - restarted on propofol after neuro evaluation for sedation and
   hypertension
   - Head CT preliminarily showed no acute infarction
   - started on tube feeds
   - pm crit stable
   - 4 am, decreasing sats to high 80s, thick secretions, temp 100 po,
   worsening CXR earlier so --> started on vanc/zosyn for aspiration
   - was found to be autopeeping, which resolved with CPAP and increased
   propofol to 60 mg(also abg O2 better than pleth sats)
   - this am had RSBI despite sedation and was 40 on pressure support

   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop azithromycin/ceftriaxone would have been D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation. The patient's neurological exam showed poor outcomes, and he was initiated on a cooling protocol. The patient had resolution of ST elevations on EKG but likely suffered from a myocardial infarction (MI) causing ventricular fibrillation (vfib), which led to the cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- The patient is sedated and intubated due to respiratory failure.
- He has been on mechanical ventilation with pressure support.
- There are concerns about aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and the patient is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn.
- The plan is to continue pressure support and attempt a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for possible extubation.
- The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and he has been on various medications to manage hypertension, including nitroglycerin and dopamine.
- The patient had a Foley catheter inserted, and there were concerns about urinary tract infection (UTI) and low urine output.
- His creatinine levels are stable and trending down, indicating improvement in renal function.
- The patient has anemia, which may be due to bleeding from the ruptured arterial line or dilutional effects from IV fluids.
- He has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place, and tube feeds have been started.

   - sedation weaned and evaluated by neuro who were encouraged by
   spontaneous movements, downgoing babinsky, followed simple command of
   raising leg, eeg showed alpha waves
   - sats dropped so got CXR which shows worsening opacities on right, but
   sats improved when better sedated (thought to be from struggling
   against machine)
   -neuro recommended head CT and take it day by day with neuro exams
   - restarted on propofol after neuro evaluation for sedation and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who experienced a cardiorespiratory arrest at home with a cardiac etiology. He was sedated and evaluated by a neurologist who observed spontaneous movements, a downgoing Babinski sign, and followed simple commands such as raising his leg. The EEG showed alpha waves, indicating some level of brain activity.

The patient's oxygen saturation levels dropped, leading to a chest X-ray that revealed worsening opacities on the right side. However, the oxygen saturation improved when the patient was better sedated, suggesting that struggling against the ventilator may have caused the decrease in saturation.

A head CT was recommended by the neurologist, and it showed no acute infarction. The patient was restarted on propofol after a neuro evaluation for sedation and hypertension. Tube feeds were also initiated.

At 4 am, the patient's oxygen saturation levels decreased to the high 80s, along with thick secretions and a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The chest X-ray showed worsening opacities, so vancomycin and zosyn were started for aspiration pneumonia.

The patient was found to be auto-peeking, which resolved with CPAP and increased propofol to 60 mg. The patient's ABG oxygen levels were better than the plethysmography saturation, indicating possible inaccurate plethysmography readings.

In the morning, the patient had an increased respiratory rate and spontaneous"

   Physical Examination
   Physical examination notable for profound sedation (propofol is at 60
   and failed RSBI). No spinal reflexes whatever. No response to pain. No
   spontaneous movement. Slight exotropia. Corneal reflexes intact (both
   eyes blink now). Pupillary response to light (3 mm) present (to 2 mm)
   but not maintained.
   Examination from yesterday:
   Spontaneous purposeless movement, in [**Location (un) 408**]-J collar, itubated on
   pressure support, tube feeds not running, urine dark with some sediment
   Patient looks stated age and overweight.
   Scleral edema present, no icterus, some spontaneous facial movement.
   Neck
 actually moving within collar, but cannot assess JVP, tone, LAD,
   etc.
   Thorax of normal appearance, symmetric expansion, clear anteriorly and
   laterally, no area of reduced breath sounds.
   Heart sounds dual, no S3/4, no M/R. Cardiac percussion reveals normal
   span with some dullness also over PMI.
   Abdomen benign
 soft, resonant, bowel sounds present (normal).
   Peripheral pulses (radial and dorsalis pedis) normal.
   Patient opened eyes and fixated on mine with sternal rub along with
   saying
[**Known firstname **]
. Did not follow commands to lift arms or close hands.
   Tone normal in arms and legs. Spontaneous movement of CN III, IV, V,
   VI, VII, [**Doctor First Name **], all limbs. Gag present (and results in increased movement
   of neck, face, limbs) when suctioned. Sluggish blink to confrontation,
   sluggish and small corneals bilaterally, pupils reactive (4->2 mm),
   biceps and brachioradialis not elicitable today, but knees brisk and
   plantar stimulation with withdrawal. No response to nail bed pressure
   or taking blood gas.

   ECG: .
   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
 they would like head MRI (likely with
   DWI)
 their impression was some worsening today
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop ceftriaxone, but continue azithromycin would have been/is D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   - Given good gas on PSV and likely lying down (due to fem line) cause
   of PSV 5/10 needed, could likely extubate, but will need to perform
   sedated MRI first, then get PICC, pull femoral line
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned. Pressure ideally
   should be in 150s or so post-cardiac arrest, but the benefit of this is
   likely no longer present
 will therefore aim for normal range.
   - stop lopressor IV while giving propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal normotension, systolics 100-140, with MAP > 65
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   - Spin urine to look for cast and red cells
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds. Should be reversible
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with no past medical history who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest that required defibrillation. He was found to have ST elevations on the EKG but showed resolution by the time he arrived at the hospital. He was initiated on a cooling protocol and has been in the ICU since then. The patient's neurological exam has shown some improvement but also some worsening, indicating an indeterminate prognosis. An MRI of the head has been ordered as suggested by Neurology. The patient is being managed for cardiac complications, including hypertension, potential myocardial infarction, and post-cardiac arrest syndrome. He is also being treated for possible infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection. There are concerns about his low urine output and possible acute kidney injury. Additionally, the patient has anemia, which may be due to bleeding or dilutional effects. He is receiving nutrition through tube feeds and prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is currently in the CCU."

   Physical Examination
   Early this a.m.
   Physical examination notable for profound sedation (propofol is at 60
   and failed RSBI). No spinal reflexes whatever. No response to pain. No
   spontaneous movement. Slight exotropia. Corneal reflexes intact (both
   eyes blink now). Pupillary response to light (3 mm) present (to 2 mm)
   but not maintained.
   Later after sedation weaned
   Patient with purposeful behavior, verbally interactive
 able to answer
   simple questions. Right nystagmus on right lateral gaze. Able to move
   all limbs to command. Facial movement symmetric. No further cognitive
   testing
 will reevaluate this p.m.
   Examination from yesterday:
   Spontaneous purposeless movement, in [**Location (un) 408**]-J collar, itubated on
   pressure support, tube feeds not running, urine dark with some sediment
   Patient looks stated age and overweight.
   Scleral edema present, no icterus, some spontaneous facial movement.
   Neck
 actually moving within collar, but cannot assess JVP, tone, LAD,
   etc.
   Thorax of normal appearance, symmetric expansion, clear anteriorly and
   laterally, no area of reduced breath sounds.
   Heart sounds dual, no S3/4, no M/R. Cardiac percussion reveals normal
   span with some dullness also over PMI.
   Abdomen benign
 soft, resonant, bowel sounds present (normal).
   Peripheral pulses (radial and dorsalis pedis) normal.
   Patient opened eyes and fixated on mine with sternal rub along with
   saying
[**Known firstname **]
. Did not follow commands to lift arms or close hands.
   Tone normal in arms and legs. Spontaneous movement of CN III, IV, V,
   VI, VII, [**Doctor First Name **], all limbs. Gag present (and results in increased movement
   of neck, face, limbs) when suctioned. Sluggish blink to confrontation,
   sluggish and small corneals bilaterally, pupils reactive (4->2 mm),
   biceps and brachioradialis not elicitable today, but knees brisk and
   plantar stimulation with withdrawal. No response to nail bed pressure
   or taking blood gas.

   Imaging: MRI head:
   Our prelim read: Leucoaraiosis, most marked around ventricles, some
   atrophy with enlarged ventricles, stable from CT. Comparison to CT
   reveals no notable edema. No obvious hypoperfusion injury (water-shed)
   or anoxic injury.
   Microbiology: Sputum culture reveals typical commensurate growth. GPCs
   in clusters seen on gram stain.
   Telemetry
 short runs of VT as above.
   Assessment
     This 66-year-old man with angina, perioral cyanosis on exertion,
   without past medical attention presents after collapsing at home. Given
   moaning and then likely VF on AED, and upon enzymes, EKG, it seems
   likely that he suffered an AMI/ACS which resulted in VT/VF and
   collapse. CPR was given at the scene, with some signs of neurologic
   injury at early presentation
 absent papillary reflexes and posturing.
   However, he has continued to reestablish function rapidly during the
   stay and his examination and progress today is particularly
   encouraging. Neurological signs noted yesterday were likely in part
   false localizing given sedation. He is now extubated. Now that his
   prognosis is looking good from a neurologic standpoint, it will be
   important to further work up in coronary artery disease.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   As above
 likely ACS with subsequent VF. Will need catheterization,
   A1c, lipids, likely statin, beta-blocker, +/- ACE. Will ensure that
   aspiration risk is low and mental status is good prior to cath to
   reduce chance of aspiration.
   - Continue present medication regimen.
   Mental Status
   Given rapid improvement in Neurologic exam, prognosis will now be good.
   Still possible damage to vulnerable structures, particularly
   hippocampus. MRI reveals leukoariaosis but no evident recent
   infarction.
   - Appreciate input from Neurology and continue to examine.
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Very bad RSBI this a.m. [**3-16**] propofol that had been increased for MRI
   yesterday. Extubated during rounds this a.m.
   Hypertension
   Pressures to 170s mmHg not immediately concerning. Allow to
   autoregulate and then control gently.
   - Will start ACE, calcium channel blocker.
   Low urine output/obstruction/ARF
   Renal failure resolving. Was likely mild ATN with brief obstructive
   nephropathy. Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially
   responded, but then dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but
   bladder scan showed almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.
   Urology replaced foley.
   Anemia
   Lost some blood in urine and with burst a-line. Not immediately
   concerning and no obvious site of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow HCt
   FEN/GI
   Now extubated and OG removed.
   - Speech and swallow assessment this afternoon
   - Restore diet based on those recommendations
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of angina and perioral cyanosis on exertion, who presented after collapsing at home. He had moaning and then likely ventricular fibrillation (VF) on automated external defibrillator (AED), and upon enzymes, electrocardiogram (EKG), it seems likely that he suffered an acute myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome (AMI/ACS) which resulted in VF and collapse.

   Imaging: MRI head:
   Our prelim read: Leucoaraiosis, most marked around ventricles, some
   atrophy with enlarged ventricles, stable from CT. Comparison to CT
   reveals no notable edema. No obvious hypoperfusion injury (water-shed)
   or anoxic injury.
   Microbiology: Sputum culture reveals typical commensurate growth. GPCs
   in clusters seen on gram stain.
   Telemetry
 short runs of VT as above.
   Assessment
     This 66-year-old man with angina, perioral cyanosis on exertion,
   without past medical attention presents after collapsing at home. Given
   moaning and then likely VF on AED, and upon enzymes, EKG, it seems
   likely that he suffered an AMI/ACS which resulted in VT/VF and
   collapse. CPR was given at the scene, with some signs of neurologic
   injury at early presentation
 absent papillary reflexes and posturing.
   However, he has continued to reestablish function rapidly during the
   stay and his examination and progress today is particularly
   encouraging. Neurological signs noted yesterday were likely in part
   false localizing given sedation. He is now extubated. Now that his
   prognosis is looking good from a neurologic standpoint, it will be
   important to further work up in coronary artery disease.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   As above
 likely ACS with subsequent VF. Will need catheterization,
   A1c, lipids, likely statin, beta-blocker, +/- ACE. Will ensure that
   aspiration risk is low and mental status is good prior to cath to
   reduce chance of aspiration.
   - Continue present medication regimen.
   Mental Status
   Given rapid improvement in Neurologic exam, prognosis will now be good.
   Still possible damage to vulnerable structures, particularly
   hippocampus. MRI reveals leukoariaosis but no evident recent
   infarction.
   - Appreciate input from Neurology and continue to examine.
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Very bad RSBI this a.m. [**3-16**] propofol that had been increased for MRI
   yesterday. Extubated during rounds this a.m.
   Hypertension
   Pressures to 170s mmHg not immediately concerning. Allow to
   autoregulate and then control gently.
   - Will start ACE, calcium channel blocker.
   Low urine output/obstruction/ARF
   Renal failure resolving. Was likely mild ATN with brief obstructive
   nephropathy. Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially
   responded, but then dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but
   bladder scan showed almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.
   Urology replaced foley.
   Anemia
   Lost some blood in urine and with burst a-line. Not immediately
   concerning and no obvious site of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow HCt
   FEN/GI
   Now extubated and OG removed.
   - Speech and swallow assessment this afternoon
   - Restore diet based on those recommendations
   - famotidine IV Q 12

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man who presented with collapsing at home, moaning, and likely ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He had a history of angina and perioral cyanosis on exertion, and upon evaluation, it is likely that he suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) which resulted in VF and collapse. CPR was given at the scene, and signs of neurological injury were observed initially, including absent papillary reflexes and posturing. However, the patient has shown rapid improvement in his neurological status, and his examination and progress today are encouraging.

The patient is now extubated and off sedation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/89 to 170/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's neurological examination has shown improvement, with purposeful behavior, verbal interaction, and symmetric facial movement. However, there is still some concern for possible brainstem infarct, as indicated by the presence of right nystagmus on right lateral gaze.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals leukoaraiosis around the ventricles,"
