   Assessment and Plan
   85-yo man w/ HTN and PAF who presented to the ED w/ dry mouth in the
   setting of treatment for BPH, then found to convert from NSR to A-Fib
   w/ [**Year (4 digits) **] to 120s-130s. Initially controlled on the floor w/ Diltiazem,
   but progressively developed worsening [**Year (4 digits) **], hypoxia, and altered mental
   status, requiring transfer to the CCU.
   .
   #. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - Pt w/ h/o PAF which he has not
   tolerated in the past. Previously controlled with BB, although this was
   changed to CCB [**3-9**] orthostatic hypotension. A-Fib w/ [**Month/Day (2) **] on admission
   today unable to be controlled with CCB but responsive to BB.
   - cont BB boluses PRN for [**Month/Day (2) **], uptitrate PO dose as needed
   - heparin gtt for anticoagulation as pt is at elevated risk of stroke
   - will likely need cardioversion given h/o intolerance of A-fib,
   consider chemical vs. electrical cardioversion in AM
   .
   #. Hypoxia - Pt w/ ARF on presentation as below, treated w/ 2L NS given
   concern for pre-renal azotemia. In setting of A-fib w/ [**Name (NI) **], pt likely
   w/ pulmonary edema [**3-9**] poor LV filling time. Responded well to IV Lasix
   boluses received on floor prior to transfer.
   - closely monitor UOP, repeat IV Lasix boluses PRN
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and renal function
   .
   #. Altered mental status - Unclear etiology, likely multifactorial
   including PAF w/ [**Hospital1 **], hypoxia, anti-cholinergic medication effect,
   sun-downing, ICU psychosis, and baseline dementia. Not improved w/ rate
   control or diuresis.
   - cont rate control and diuresis as above
   - IV Haldol PRN
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt w/ hypertension at home, treated only with
   Diltiazem. BPs here have responded to both Dilt and BB treatment for
   rate control.
   - continue to monitor while treating for rate control as above
   - holding Dilt while trying Lopressor for rate control
   - continue Florinef
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt w/ elevated Cr to 1.8-1.9 (from bl Cr 1.3).
   [**Month (only) 60**] be [**3-9**] A-Fib w/ [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-9**] poor forward flow. Received 2L NS in the
   ED, then became hypoxic which responded to IV Lasix boluses.
   - cont diuresis as above
   - cont close monitoring w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes and renal function
   - check urine lytes and bilateral renal ultrasounds as not improving,
   esp given h/o BPH and tx w/ Detrol for bladder spasms
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - Pt tx w/ Florinef at home. Also BB was
   changed to CCB.
   - cont Florinef
   - holding CCB while trying BB for rate control

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). He presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was found to have converted from normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Initially, he was controlled on the floor with diltiazem, but he developed worsening symptoms, hypoxia, and altered mental status, which required transfer to the critical care unit (CCU).

The patient's current condition includes intermittent delirium, apnea requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), an arterial line placed with stable blood pressure, minimal urine output, and signs of pre-renal azotemia. He was fluid challenged with 250 mL normal saline (NS) in the morning and showed no improvement in urine output. His urine analysis revealed >50 white blood cells (WBCs), moderate leukocytes, and moderate bacteria, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Culture results are pending.

The patient has been receiving amiodarone infusion for rate control and has had episodes of hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and diuretic therapy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 87/69 to 79/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). He presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was initially treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, he developed worsening rate-responsive ventricular tachycardia (RVR) and hypoxia, requiring transfer to the critical care unit (CCU). The patient's condition has progressively worsened, leading to acute renal failure, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and hypertension. He has multiple comorbidities including depression, osteoarthritis (DJD), and peptic ulcer disease (PPx). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 94 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 75/69 mmHg to 87/69 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was found to have converted from normal sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Initially controlled on the floor with diltiazem, he developed worsening rapid ventricular response, hypoxia, and altered mental status, requiring transfer to the CCU. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, possible urinary tract infection, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, depression, and previous peptic ulcer disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending up, indicating worsening kidney function. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
2. Possible urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has pyuria and renal failure, which increases the risk of a UTI. This can cause symptoms such as fever, urinary urgency, and frequency.
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of PAF and is currently being treated with digoxin and a beta-blocker for rate control. If not managed properly, this condition can lead to complications like stroke or heart failure.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, which"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presented to the emergency department with dry mouth. He was initially treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but was found to have converted from normal sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His condition progressively worsened, leading to worsening renal function, hypoxia, and altered mental status. He was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) where he is currently being managed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may be due to renal hypoperfusion, possibly secondary to his cardiac conditions. It is important to monitor urine output and follow electrolyte and BUN levels closely. If needed, consider low-volume intravenous (LR) boluses.
2. Possible urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of pyuria, along with renal failure, raises the possibility of a UTI. Continue empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and follow up with urine culture results.
3. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): The patient's echocardiogram shows a reduced LVEF of 30% with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation. These cardiac abnormalities may have contributed to renal and hep"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was initially treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, he developed worsening rate ventricular response (RVR), hypoxia, and altered mental status, leading to transfer to the critical care unit (CCU). The patient's condition has been complicated by acute renal failure, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels continue to increase, indicating worsening renal function. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolytes, BUN, and Cr is necessary. LR boluses may be considered if needed.
2. Possible UTI: The patient has pyuria, renal failure, and stable blood pressure. Empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone should be continued, and follow-up urine culture is recommended.
3. Reduced LVEF: The patient's EF is 30% with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and mitral regurgitation (MR). These conditions may have contributed to renal and hepatic hypoperfusion. Cardiac catheterization may be considered during this admission, but only after renal failure resolves.
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of PAF, which he has not tolerated in the past. RVR on admission required diltiazem, and amiodarone was initially started but discontinued due to rising LFTs. Digoxin should be avoided due to renal failure. Beta-blocker therapy should be uptitrated for better rate control, and the INR should be monitored.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely similar to past delirium while in the hospital. No localized neurodeficit is present, and the patient's mental status is improving. Monitoring mental status, reorientation as needed, and avoiding psychotropic medications are recommended.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's transaminases continue to rise, likely due to shock physiology from hypoperfusion. Trends in LFTs should be continued, and follow-up hepatitis panel is advised.
7. History of hypertension: The patient's BPs have been stable during hospitalization. Holding diltiazem and initiating lopressor for rate control are appropriate. Discontinuing fludrocort is also recommended.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented to the emergency department with dry mouth. He was being treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but developed worsening rapid ventricular response (RVR), hypoxia, and altered mental status. He was initially controlled on the floor with diltiazem but required transfer to the critical care unit (CCU) due to worsening RVR, hypoxia, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate worsening renal function. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolytes, BUN, and Cr is necessary. If needed, consider low-risk (LR) boluses to manage fluid balance.
2. Possible urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of pyuria, renal failure, and stable blood pressure suggests a potential UTI. Continue empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and follow up with urine culture.
3. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): The patient's echocardiogram shows an EF of 30% with moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and mitral regurgitation (MR). These conditions may contribute"

   Assessment and Plan
   85M w/ HTN and PAF (not on Coumadin [**3-9**] fall risk), who originally
   presented to the ED w/ dry mouth in the setting of BPH treatment, was
   found to convert from NSR to A-Fib w/ RVR to 120s-130s. Initially
   rate-controlled on the floor w/ diltiazem, but progressively developed
   worsening RVR, w hypoxia and altered mental status, requiring transfer
   to the CCU.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: LVEF 30% 2/2 dilated CMP, with
   mod-severe AS, TR, MR, all of which have probably contributed to renal
   and hepatic hypoperfusion. Mildly hypovolemic [**3-9**] autodiuresis from
   resolving renal failure
   - consider cardiac catheterization during this admission but only after
   renal failure resolves vs as outpatient
   - continue metoprolol
   .
   # PAF - Pt w/ h/o PAF which he has not tolerated in the past. Not on
   Coumadin [**3-9**] fall risk. RVR on admission, requiring diltiazem.
   Amiodorone was initially started but d/c'ed due to rising LFTs. Digoxin
   d/c
d [**3-9**] ARF. Metoprolol uptitrated to 100mg PO QID, but HRs still
   90s-100s.
   - monitor HR today, consider further uptitrating metoprolol tomorrow
   - INR downtrending
   .
   # ARF: Likely prerenal/ATN [**3-9**] renal hypoperfusion. Creatinine now
   downtrending. ARF is resolving, with great UOP. Renal u/s unremarkable.
   - monitor urine output throughout the day
   - hold ACEI
   - follow electrolytes, BUN, Cr [**Hospital1 **]
   - if needed, consider LR boluses
   .
   # Possible UTI: with pyuria, renal failure. BP has been stable so far.

   - d/c ceftriaxone and flagyl
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Rising Na and Cl likely from aggressive NS infusions
   and mild hypovolemia.
   - Encourage PO free water intake
   - follow electrolytes, BUN, Cr [**Hospital1 **]

   hospital. No localized neuro deficit. Improving mentation.
   - monitor mental status
   - re-orient as needed
   - avoid psychotropic meds if possible

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was found to have converted from normal sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He initially received rate control with diltiazem but developed worsening rapid ventricular response, hypoxia, and altered mental status, requiring transfer to the critical care unit.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% due to dilated cardiomyopathy, moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and mitral regurgitation (MR). These conditions have likely contributed to renal and hepatic hypoperfusion.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of paroxysmal AF, which he has not tolerated in the past. He was not on warfarin (Coumadin) due to fall risk. On admission, he had rapid ventricular response requiring diltiazem. Amiodarone was initially started but discontinued due to rising liver function tests (LFTs). Digoxin was also discontinued due to acute renal failure (ARF). Metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg PO QID, but the patient's heart rate remained in the 90s-100s. Further uptitration of metoprolol may be considered.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient likely has prerenal/acute tubular necrosis (ATN) renal hypoperfusion. His serum creatinine levels have been trending downward, indicating resolution of ARF. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine is advised.

4. Possible urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has pyuria and renal failure. His blood pressure has been stable. Urine culture is positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. Antibiotic therapy should be switched to cefpodoxime 200mg PO q24h through [**2171-2-16**] (14-day course). Ceftriaxone and metronidazole should be discontinued.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has rising sodium levels and chloride likely from aggressive normal saline infusions and mild hypovolemia. Encouraging oral free water intake is recommended. Electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine should be followed.

6. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's transaminase levels are stable today. Elevated LFTs are likely due to shock physiology from hypoperfusion. Continued monitoring of LFTs until they downtrend is advised."
