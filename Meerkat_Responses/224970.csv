   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-26**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs [**Known lastname 9774**] is a bit more dyspneic today. Chest CT scan shows a
   persistent infiltrate in the right lower lobe despite two reported
   courses of antibiotics as an outpatient. She has reported no further
   chest pain. She is afebrile with SBPs in the 84 to 124 range. Echo
   shows inferior and inferolateral wall motion abnormaility, anterior
   septum and anterior walls are severely hypokinetic - EF 25%. For her
   CAD and recent MI with stenting to the LAD we will continue PLavix,
   ASA, metoprolol, capropril. For her new ASMI we will begin heparin and
   coumadin to prophylax aaginst mural thrombus. She can be transferred to
   the stepdown unit today of BP remains stable.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2165-12-26**] 02:45 PM ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) following coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient underwent stenting of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to complete occlusion.

The patient's current medical condition includes:

1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and experienced an anterior STEMI. The LAD was found to be completely occluded during the angiography, and a bare-metal stent (BMS) was placed in the proximal LAD.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient is showing signs of substantial oxygen requirement and is concerning for pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%.

3. Respiratory infection: The patient has worsening right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray and new left haziness, which are concerning for pneumonia (PNA). The patient has a long smoking history and mildly hyperinflated lungs, likely indicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at baseline.

4. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 48, indicating chronic renal insufficiency. Renally dosed medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) following cardiac catheterization. The patient had a completely occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving multiple medications including heparin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and others. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 84/48 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 69 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry crackles in the right lung base and no other significant findings. Laboratory results indicate elevated troponin-T levels at 3.99, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 12.1 g/dL, and low potassium (K+) at 3.5 mEq/L.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Chest CT demonstrates nodules c/w primary or metastatic CA. Plan is to
   have Pulm come by to eval for bronchoscopy while on Plavix. CK peak
   598. Echo with EF 35%, akinesis lateral wall EF 30-35%. Would increase
   BBs and ok to send to floror
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **], [**Name (NI) **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
- Patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.
- The patient has multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ectopy.
- Chest X-ray shows worsening opacity in the right lower lobe (RLL) with increased haziness in the left base, raising concerns about new consolidation. A CT chest is recommended to evaluate for recurrent pneumonia or lung cancer.
- The patient completed a course of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin for RLL pneumonia last year.
- The patient's current medications include Plavix, aspirin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and heparin.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require supplemental oxygen. Their cardiac ejection fraction is estimated to be 30-35%.
- The patient's respiratory status is improving, but they have multiple pulmonary nodules on CT chest suggestive of primary or metastatic neoplasm.
- The patient's renal function is impaired with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 48.
- The patient's blood pressure is mildly hypotensive, and their lipid profile is abnormal.
- The patient has a history of macular degeneration and chronic renal insufficiency.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1515**] [**Known lastname 9774**] is a 81 yo female with a history of CAD who presented
   with an STEMI s/p cath.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with anterior STEMI.  SVG found to be completely
   occluded and a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.   Currently having
   multiple episodes on NSVT and ectopy
   - plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg daily
   - metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID, uptitrate as possible given multiple
   ectopic beats and NSVT
   - Echo with akinesis
 pt started on heparin gtt with start cuomadin
   - atorvastatin 80mg PO daily
   - monitor CE, currently downtrending
   .
   # PUMP:  patient appears clinically euvolemic, however, patient with
   substantial oxygen requirement concerning for pulmonary edema. ECHO
   with EF 30-35%. SOB did not improve with Lasix overnight.
   - restart ACEI as possible with BP holding parameters
   # RHYTHM: currently in normal sinus rhythm.  Few episodes of NSVT.
   - will monitor on tele.
   - titrate up B-blocker as possible
   - d/c albuterol and start xopinex for less B-agonist effect
   .
   #Post-obstructive PNA: Chest CT with multiple pulmonary nodules, likely
   from primary or metastatic neoplasm.  Respiratory status stable/
   improving with decreasing O2 requirements.  Currently afebrile with no
   leukocytosis.  Pt with long smoking history and mildly hyperinflated
   lungs
 likely retainer at baseline. Goal O2sat 88-92%.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and macular degeneration.

The patient's current condition is concerning for pulmonary edema, as indicated by the need for high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen and the presence of crackles in the right lower lobe (RLL) on physical examination. The patient also has multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ectopy. 

Labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low platelet count (PLT), and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 48. The cardiac enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponin T are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal severe consolidation in the RLL, which has progressed or recurred over the past year. There are also multiple diffuse lung nodules seen on computed tomography (CT) scan, which could be explained by multifocal bronchioalveolar carcinoma or metastases. A pulmonary consultation has"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals multiple bronchial nodules on chest X-ray, suggestive of possible neoplasm or metastasis from a multinodular thyroid. A CT scan is planned to further evaluate these findings. The patient also has a Foley catheter in place due to urinary incontinence.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 5.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 185 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 3.99. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of coronary artery disease, with prescribed medications such as clopidogrel, aspirin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. The patient's cardiac ejection fraction"

- The patient has a completely occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- The patient is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with Plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg daily, along with metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
- The patient's blood pressure is low, so ACE inhibitors have been withheld.
- An echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%, indicating reduced heart function.
- The patient is experiencing substantial oxygen requirements, which may be concerning for pulmonary edema. Despite receiving Lasix overnight, the patient's symptoms did not improve.
- The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has had a few episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the proximal left anterior descending artery. The patient is currently experiencing multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ectopy. She has been started on dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin, and her beta-blocker dose is being uptitrated. The patient appears clinically euvolemic but has substantial oxygen requirements, concerning for pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 30-35%. The patient's respiratory status is stable/improving with decreasing oxygen requirements. She has a history of post-obstructive pneumonia with multiple pulmonary nodules, likely from primary or metastatic neoplasm. She is currently afebrile with no leukocytosis and has a long smoking history. The patient's chronic renal insufficiency is being managed with dose adjustments of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins. Her hypertension is being monitored and adjusted as necessary. The patient also has hyperlipidemia and macular degeneration, for which appropriate medications and interventions are being implemented. The patient is on a cardiac diet and has prophylactic measures in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   CXR shows new consolidation at the left base and ongoing
   post-obstructive PNA at the right base suspicious for a metastatic
   process. No known primary now. Pulmonary plans to send sputum for
   cytology now then have her back in 2 to 3 weeks for bronch with
   brushings. She will need plavix for one month as she had a BMS this
   admission. She remains in the CCU due to her O2 requirements as her
   sats are 94-95% on 6L NC and 60% shovel mask. INR is 2.5 (for new
   ASMI). We will continue Zithromycin, Ceftriaxome and flagyl for
   pneumonia. Metoprolol and captopril for ischemic myopathy EF 30-35%
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing stenting of the proximal left anterior descending artery. The patient is currently in the ICU due to ongoing oxygen requirements and potential pulmonary edema. She has multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ectopy. The patient's cardiac ejection fraction is estimated to be 30-35%.

The patient's chest X-ray shows new consolidation at the left base and ongoing post-obstructive pneumonia at the right base, which is suspicious for a metastatic process. No known primary tumor has been identified yet. The pulmonary team plans to send sputum for cytology and schedule a bronchoscopy with brushings in 2-3 weeks. The patient will also be started on Plavix for one month as she had a bare metal stent (BMS) during this admission.

The patient's other medical conditions include chronic renal insufficiency with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 48, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and macular degeneration. She is currently on medications such as metoprolol, captopril, atorvastatin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and metronidazole.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   CXR shows new consolidation at the left base and ongoing
   post-obstructive PNA at the right base suspicious for a metastatic
   process. No known primary now. Pulmonary plans to send sputum for
   cytology now then have her back in 2 to 3 weeks for bronch with
   brushings. She will need plavix for one month as she had a BMS this
   admission. She remains in the CCU due to her O2 requirements as her
   sats are 94-95% on 6L NC and 60% shovel mask. INR is 2.5 (for new
   ASMI). We will continue Zithromycin, Ceftriaxome and flagyl for
   pneumonia. Metoprolol and captopril for ischemic myopathy EF 30-35%
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She also has multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ectopy.

The patient's current condition includes severe right lower lobe consolidation, extensive new diffuse lung nodules, and diffuse severe coronary artery calcification. She has a history of post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) with multiple pulmonary nodules, likely from primary or metastatic neoplasm. The patient's respiratory status is stable/improving with decreasing O2 requirements, but she requires supplemental oxygen. She is currently afebrile with no leukocytosis.

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 48, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and macular degeneration. She is on various medications including heparin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, metronidazole, atorvastatin, metoprolol, aspirin, and clopidogrel.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, further cardiac events, infection, and complications related to her chronic renal insufficiency. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation, and any changes in her"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, hypoxemia, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient has been receiving antibiotics, bronchodilators, and other ICU medications. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/50-135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation via face tent and is being monitored closely. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 562 mL since 12 AM. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, and white blood cell count (WBC), while other parameters are within normal limits. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's pneumonia may worsen or lead to a hospital-acquired infection.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation and the use of mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory distress.
3. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's recent AMI, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial ischemia"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing a coronary angioplasty and stenting procedure. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and experiencing multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ectopy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/50 mmHg to 135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a face tent. Her physical examination reveals a sleepy but easily arousable patient with appropriate mood and affect. She has no jugular venous distension or murmurs, and her lungs are clear with diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, with diminished breath sounds at the right lung base.

Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. However, her troponin-T level is elevated at 3.99, and her C-reactive protein (CRP) level is high at 28 mg/dL. Her blood glucose level is within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 48,"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient remains on less O2 with sats in the low 90s on NC O2 [**4-22**]
   liters. She and her family are aware that the lesions in the lungs are
   likely mailgnant and that pulm wants to wait for 2 weeks (out from MI)
   to perform bronch with BAL. OK to stepdown today.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She has been experiencing multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ectopy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/50 mmHg to 135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on face tent, and sinus rhythm. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and various medications such as aspirin, Plavix, captopril, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and Xopenex/ipratropium.

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant and alert appearance, with no jugular venous distention (JVD). Cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 sounds. No murmurs, regurgitation, or gallops are present. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, with diminished breath sounds at the right lung base. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with no hepatomegaly or tenderness."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stent placement in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient has been prescribed multiple medications including Plavix, aspirin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and Xopenex.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to substantial oxygen requirements and concern for pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram has shown an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%. Despite administration of Lasix, the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) have not improved. The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm, but there have been episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which have improved with increased beta-blocker use.

The patient also has post-obstructive pneumonia with multiple pulmonary nodules likely from primary or metastatic neoplasm. The patient's respiratory status is stable/improving with decreasing oxygen requirements. The patient has a long smoking history and mildly hyperinflated lungs.

The patient is currently afebrile with no leukocytosis. The goal oxygen saturation is >90%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen as needed, off the face mask"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She has been diagnosed with multiple pulmonary nodules, likely from primary or metastatic neoplasm. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory support due to hypoxia and suspected pulmonary edema. She is on supplemental oxygen and has a goal oxygen saturation above 90%. Her recent tests show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolyte levels, and kidney function. However, her troponin T level is elevated, indicating ongoing cardiac injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's substantial oxygen requirement and bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. Aggressive management is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines. Prophylactic antibiotics have been started, but close monitoring for signs of infection is essential.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors, DVT prophylaxis with therapeutic heparin is recommended.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been prescribed ranitidine, which may help reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
- She has multiple comorbidities including chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, macular degeneration, and a smoking history.
- The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory support due to significant oxygen requirements and concerns for pulmonary edema.
- She has a history of diarrhea, which is likely antibiotic-associated and has been treated with ranitidine.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and her echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 30-35%.
- Imaging studies reveal multiple pulmonary nodules, suggesting a possible primary or metastatic neoplasm.
- The patient is receiving appropriate cardiac medications, including aspirin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and warfarin.
- Fluid analysis does not show any abnormalities.
- The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, but there is no fever or leukocytosis.
- She has mild hyperinflation of the lungs and bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray.
- The patient's code status is presumed full, and she is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with supplemental oxygen.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 34**] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 9774**] remains hypoxic on NC O2 6 L and shovel mask albeit not
   symptomatic. Her sats drop to high 70s with small movements like
   getting up to the commode. Her CXR continues to show bibasilar
   opacities. I spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60**] this am who feels her desaturation
   and hypoxia are related to a substantial tumor burden involving the
   lungs in the setting of pneumonia and post-obstructive pneumonia. His
   recommendation was to aggressively pursue sputum for cytology in terms
   of obtaining a diagnosis and if no diagnosis is available by Wednesday
   he will consider a high risk bronchoscopy with BAL despite [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   and coumadin. He felt there was no utility now in performing a CTA as
   PE is unlikely and we are anticoagulating her with coumadin anyway.
   Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and ACEI for her CAD and recent NSTEMI.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 34**] and Pride.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The patient was found to have complete occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) and a bare metal stent (BMS) was placed in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient is on aspirin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and other cardiac medications.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient appears clinically euvolemic but has a substantial oxygen requirement, which is concerning for pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%.
3. Respiratory status: The patient has multiple pulmonary nodules, likely from primary or metastatic neoplasm. Her respiratory status is stable/improving with decreasing O2 requirements. She is afebrile and does not have leukocytosis. The goal is to maintain an O2 saturation >90%.
4. Diarrhea: The patient likely has antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which is negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). She is prescribed imodium as needed.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has a glomerular filtration"

","Summary:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease.
- She presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where a bare-metal stent was placed in the proximal left anterior descending artery.
- The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requires supplemental oxygen due to hypoxemia.
- Imaging and laboratory results indicate the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules and positive cytology for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
- The patient's respiratory status has been improving, but she still has high oxygen requirements and is unable to be transferred out of the ICU.
- Other medical conditions include chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, macular degeneration, and a recent episode of diarrhea that is likely antibiotic-associated.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, statins, anticoagulants, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: Given the patient's respiratory status and the presence of malignant pulmonary nodules, there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, including pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recent STEMI. There is a risk of developing heart failure or arrhythmias due to ongoing myocardial ischemia or other cardiac issues.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient had a completely occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient's current condition is concerning for pulmonary edema, as evidenced by oxygen requirements and findings on an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 30-35%. The patient has multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with a primary or metastatic neoplasm, and cytology is positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma. 

The patient's recent medical history includes chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, macular degeneration, and diarrhea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's clinical presentation and echocardiogram findings suggest substantial oxygen requirements and a reduced ejection fraction, indicating possible pulmonary edema. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
2. Adenocarcinoma: The presence of multiple pulmonary nodules and positive cytology for malignant cells suggests a possible adenocarcinoma. Further evaluation and staging are necessary to determine the extent of the disease and appropriate treatment options.
3. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's glomerular filtration rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known firstname 1515**] [**Known lastname 9774**] is a 81 yo female with a history of CAD who presented
   with an STEMI s/p cath.
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with anterior STEMI.  SVG found to be completely
   occluded and a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.
   - plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg daily
   - metoprolol 25 mg TID
   - Echo with akinesis
 coumadin therapeutic, d/c heparin
   - atorvastatin 80mg PO daily
   # PUMP:  patient appears clinically euvolemic, however, patient with
   substantial oxygen requirement concerning for pulmonary edema. ECHO
   with EF 30-35%. SOB did not improve with Lasix
   - Metoprolol 25 tid
   - Lisinopril reduced to 2.5  yesterday
   # RHYTHM: currently in normal sinus rhythm.  Few episodes of NSVT,
   improved with increased B-blocker.
   - will monitor on tele.
   - xopinex for less B-agonist effect
   #Post-obstructive PNA: Chest CT with multiple pulmonary nodules, likely
   from primary or metastatic neoplasm.  Cytology now positive for
   malginant cells consistent w adenopcarcinoma, but unable to do further
   tests on cytology sample.  Tissue biopsy woudl be idea but given
   respiratory status and high risk for bronch, should consider other
   alternatives. Respiratory status stable/ improving with decreasing O2
   requirements.  Currently afebrile with no leukocytosis.  Pt with long
   smoking history and mildly hyperinflated lungs
 likely retainer at
   baseline. Goal O2sat >:90%  HIgh O2 requirement prevents tranfer from
   ICU
   - supplemental O2 prn
   - ABG showed pt truely hypoxemic when sating 82% on 6L w PaO2 in 40s
   - cont nebs standing and prn.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs
   - Heme Onc c/s for ? further workup, options for empiric tx.
   - c/s rad onc re: potential treatmetn to reduce obstruction and
   oxygenation prior to further workup.
   - cont ceftriaxone/ azithromycin/ metronidazole for postobstructive PNA
   #Diarrhea - likely abx associated diarrhea.  Cdiff negative
   # Chronic renal insufficiency - patient with GFR 48.
   - renally dose medications & avoid nephrotoxins
   # HTN - BB and ACE I as above
   # Macular Degeneration - continue vitamins & minerals
   #FEN:  low sodium diet
   #ACCESS: PIV's

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 34**] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 9774**] retains her lovely disposition. She remains hypoxemic
   off her supplemental O2 with sats in the mid 70s to lower 80s without
   any complaints of SOB at the time. This would suggest that this is a
   chronic state for her. Sputum cytology is positive for adenocarcinoma
   like bronchioalveolar CA which carries a very poor prognosis. We have
   consulted Heme-Onc and Rad-Onc and are awaiting their input. For her
   STEMI and stent to LAD she continues Plavix and asa (BMS). She is on
   coumadin for prevention of mural thrombus and her INR is 3.0. We will
   continue antibiotics for 10 days total and transfer her to the stepdown
   unit on [**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 3. I have spoken with the charge nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 408**] 3 and
   notified her of Mrs[**Known lastname 9895**] intermittent desaturation without
   symptoms and she is willing to take the patient as long as O2 sat
   parameters are made clear in the orders.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 34**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
- The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, likely due to tumor burden, and poor prognosis indicated by positive sputum cytology for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
- The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, macular degeneration, and diarrhea, which is likely antibiotic-associated.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/50 to 129/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- The patient has been prescribed various medications, including Plavix, aspirin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and coumadin.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows unchanged findings, and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 30-35%.
- The patient's respiratory status has been improving, with decreasing oxygen requirements, but she still requires supplemental oxygen.
- The patient's abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds, and there is no evidence of lower extremity edema.
- The patient's laboratory results indicate slightly elevated white blood cell"
