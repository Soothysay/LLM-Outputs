   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 yo F with Hx of COPD w/ hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Improved on vent w/ PEEP but becomes
   tachypneic when off of PEEP.
   - Continue ventilated for now
   -IV steroids
   -Azithromycin+Ceftriaxone for possible tracheobronchitis.
   -Standing albuterol and atrovent
   -Rate control with IV diltiazem as needed and as tolerated
   -Ventilation with PEEP of 10 to match her autopeep, TV 6-8cc/kg IBW, RR
   15, decrease FIO2 as tolerated.
   .
   Hypotension: Resolved w/ stopping sedation.
   - maintain minimal sedation necessary for pt. comfort.
   .
   A.fib: Rate controlled.
   -Con't Digoxin,
   -PRN IV diltiazem if rate becomes uncontrolled again.
   -Allow coumadin to drift and consider starting heparin gtt if gets
   below 2 for consideration of procedures

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of COPD who is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient's main issues include hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, depression, gout, and potential feeding tube placement.

The patient's respiratory status has improved while on mechanical ventilation with PEEP but becomes tachypneic when PEEP is removed. It is decided to continue ventilated for now. The patient is also being given IV steroids, azithromycin with ceftriaxone for possible tracheobronchitis, standing albuterol and atrovent, and rate control with IV diltiazem as needed and as tolerated.

The patient's hypotension has resolved with stopping sedation, so minimal sedation necessary for patient comfort will be maintained. Atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with digoxin and IV diltiazem, and consideration is being given to starting heparin if the INR goes below 2 for procedures.

The patient is likely experiencing prerenal acute renal failure given the improvement in blood pressure with decreased sedation. This will be reassessed in the afternoon, and afternoon labs will be done.

The patient's depression will continue with home regimen. Gout management will involve continuing colchicine and monitoring renal function. A nutrition consult has been ordered, and the patient will start total parent"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 yo F with hx of COPD and severe TR who presents with
   severe SOB, hypoxia, tachypnea and wheezing consistent with COPD
   exacerbation.
   .
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Most likely etiology is severe COPD
   flare given her presenting symptoms. There is no sign of infection on
   her CXR, no fever and no increased WBC so infection is less likely.
   There was also likely a component of CHF, possibly diastolic given
   normal EF, in the setting of a.fib with RVR as the increased rate
   likely decreased her diastolic filling time.
   -IV steroids
   -Azithromycin+Ceftriaxone for possible tracheobronchitis.
   -Standing albuterol and atrovent
   -Rate control with IV diltiazem as needed and as tolerated given her
   low BP
   -IV lasix as tolerated given her low BP
   -Ventilation with PEEP of 10 to match her autopeep, TV 6-8cc/kg IBW, RR
   15, decrease FIO2 as tolerated.
   .
   Hypotension: Likely a combination of auto PEEP and sedation. No signs
   of infection to indicate sepsis at this time. Possible cardiac etiology
   as well although EKG with no signs of ischemia.
   -Volume resuscitate based on UOP
   -Peripheral phenylephrine for now and ween quickly. If not able to
   ween, consider central line.
   -Trend CEZ
   .
   A.fib: Improved rate control now. Likely stimulated from adrenergic
   surge during acute respiratory event and now improved after intubation.
   -Con't Digoxin, check dig level in am
   -PRN IV diltiazem if rate becomes uncontrolled again.
   -Allow coumadin to drift and consider starting heparin gtt if gets
   below 2 for consideration of procedures

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   85 yo female with COPD admitted with hypercarbic resp failure
   1. Resp failure: appears secondary to COPD exacerbation
   *On nebs, solumedrol, CTX/azithromycin
   *Blood gas improved and Pt waking up- will attempt SBT today
   2. Rapid afib: no further recurrence since pt was intubated- appears
   due to acute resp failure causing sympathetic surge. Continue to
   monitor; continue digoxin. Add beta blocker for rate control.
   3. Elevated CK's: troponin up to 1.1. Under circumstances, this looks
   related to demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event.
   Continue cycling cardiac enzymes. Pt on ASA
   4. Hypotension: overnight, required neo gtt for BP. THis occurred
   post-intubation and was likely due to a combintation of sedation and
   PEEP (auto-PEEP). Now off neo. Continue to maintain MAP>65

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with severe COPD admitted for a COPD exacerbation. She went into rapid atrial fibrillation and developed acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/51 mmHg to 119/72 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory support with an endotracheal tube, and receiving supplemental oxygen at a FiO2 of 40%. The arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2 of 393 mmHg, and a respiratory system compliance of 36.4 cmH2O/mL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, and no cyanosis or clubbing. The laboratory results indicate normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver function tests. The troponin T level is slightly elevated at 0.11 ng/mL, but not concerning for an acute thrombotic event. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include hypotension,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of COPD, currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient also has NSTEMI, for which she is receiving aspirin, beta-blocker, and high-dose statin therapy. She is anticoagulated with Coumadin. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/44 to 154/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds diffusely, scant wheezing, and no lower extremity edema. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels, as well as slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's current medications include midazolam, phenylephrine, metoprolol, Lansoprazole, morphine sulfate, ASA, beta-blocker, high-dose statin, and Coumadin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of lung sounds, sputum cultures, and adherence to weaning trials are important to prevent this complication.

   Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Improved on vent w/ PEEP but becomes
   tachypneic when off of PEEP.  Patient was not able to tolerate pressure
   support and likely had NSTEMI as a result of the stress.  Patient will
   likely not improve post-extubation.
   - Continue IV steroids
   - Continue Azithromycin+Ceftriaxone for possible tracheobronchitis.
   - Standing albuterol and atrovent

   s/p NSTEMI:  Patient
s peak CK was 86 yesterday at 2pm and was started
   on ASA, BB, Statin.  Patient was therapeutically anticoaulgated with

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient tolerated pressure support well but experienced an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) likely due to the stress of the procedure. The patient was started on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy and was anticoagulated with Coumadin.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 57 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 112/44 to 154/75 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. The patient is sedated and unresponsive to commands but follows stimuli. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds diffusely with scant wheezing, an irregular heartbeat with a II/VI systolic murmur, and no lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 38.0%, platelet count (Plt) of 317 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.11 ng/mL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 30 mmHg, and glucose of 126 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition has improved with ventilatory support and PEEP but becomes tachypneic when off of PEEP. The patient is unlikely to improve post-extubation. Continue IV steroids, azithromycin, ceftriaxone for possible tracheobronchitis, standing albuterol and atrovent, and discuss family goals of care.
2. NSTEMI: The patient experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) as a result of the stress. The patient's peak CK was 86 yesterday at 2 pm, and they were started on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy. The patient is therapeutically anticoagulated with Coumadin.
3. Unstable BPs: The patient's blood pressures have been unstable due to increased sedation, but the patient is hypertensive off sedation. Continue ASA, BB, Statin, wean sedation as tolerated, and use esmolol for HR < 90.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Rate control. Continue digoxin, and use esmolol for HR < 90.
5. Acute renal failure (AR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and rapid atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation with sedation. The patient attempted a spontaneous breathing test but was poorly tolerated due to tachypnea, tachycardia, and diaphoresis. Her blood pressure dropped again, leading to the resumption of mechanical ventilation.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient experienced several significant events. She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with peak CK at 2:30 pm. New inferolateral ST-T wave inversions were observed on her EKG, and she was started on aspirin and statin therapy. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/61 mmHg to 72/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and unable to provide her medical history.

The patient is receiving various medications including midazolam, phenylephrine, metoprolol, lansoprazole, morphine sulfate, and others. She has allergies to no known medications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation and a recent NSTEMI. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has experienced difficulty tolerating weaning from sedation and has shown signs of agitation, tachycardia, and diaphoresis during spontaneous breathing trials. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/61 mmHg to 92/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus bradycardia. The patient's lab results indicate hypernatremia, elevated white blood cell count, and troponin T levels within normal range. The EKG shows new inferolateral ST-T wave inversions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. The patient should be monitored for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or quantity.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued to prevent DVT and subsequent PE.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 yo F with Hx of COPD w/ hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Improved on vent w/ PEEP but becomes
   tachypneic when off of PEEP.  Patient was not able to tolerate pressure
   support and likely had NSTEMI as a result of the stress.  Patient will
   likely not improve post-extubation.
   - Continue IV steroids
   - Continue Azithromycin+Ceftriaxone for possible tracheobronchitis.
   - Standing albuterol and atrovent
   -d/w family goals of care
   .
   s/p NSTEMI:  Patient
s peak CK was 86 yesterday at 2pm and was started
   on ASA, BB, Statin.  Patient was therapeutically anticoaulgated with
   Coumadin.  Likely secondary to pressure support trial stress.
   Patient
s BPs have been unstable with increased sedation, however
   patient is hypertensive off sedation.
   -          Cont ASA, BB, Statin
   -          Wean sedation as tolerated
   -          Esmolol for HR < 90
   .
   A.fib: Rate controlled.
   -Con't Digoxin,
   - Esmolol for HR < 90

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU and extubated. The patient is currently on morphine sulfate infusion for pain management and lorazepam (Ativan) for sedation as needed.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure of 82/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 73%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit, normal platelet count, and normal creatinine levels. Troponin levels are within normal range, and glucose levels are stable.

The assessment and plan include continuing IV steroids, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone for possible tracheobronchitis. The patient is also on albuterol and atrovent nebulizers. The family's goals of care are being discussed.

The patient experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) likely due to the stress of the pressure support trial. The patient was started on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy, and was anticoagulated with Coumadin.

The patient's blood pressure has been unstable with increased sedation, but she is"
