   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo F with recurrent admissions for line associated bacterimia now
   presenting with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors.
   .
   # Sepsis/ hypoension/ fevers: likely line sepsis in this woman with
   chronic central venous access.  No clear focal neuro deficits, although
   cannot r/o diskitis at L4/L5.  Despite down-trending WBC, high-grade
   fevers & hypotension poorly responsive to fluid requiring pressors
   (0.04 levo) highly suggestive of sepsis. Line is the most likely cause
   given her history, but cannot rule out disciitis and would apreciate
   further ID and NSGY input on diagnosis and mgt. Urinary tract could
   also be source.
   - per chart review, pt
s BP runs low (systolic 90s-100s).  Will d/c
   levo and ensure that UOP > 40 cc/hr.
   - cefepime 2gm IV bid (no h/o ESBL), and daptomycin 6mg/kg IV daily
   (h/o MRSE bacteremia, allergic to vancomycin)
   - micafungin added [**2146-5-31**] as per ID, due to hx of [**Female First Name (un) 188**]
   - will likely need to change femoral line over wire if this seems to be
   a line infection; if no organism is found, will need ID input as to Abx
   therapy.  This is possible since pt was on Abx therapy prior to
   admission
 we may need to determine a course without culture data.
   - blood/urine cultures pending.  Will add fungal blood cx.
   - trend wbc and temp
   - aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - RUQ US normal and biliary tree now unlikely infectious source despite
   high Tbili.
   - tagged read cell scan tomorrow; then CT guided Bx for discitis if
   tagged scan is positive.
   # Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia: ddx includes medication induced
   (although no major medications which are likely culprits) vs. sepsis
   (although time course seems unusual).  Of note, her OSH UTI med was
   macrobid.
   - will trend values and watch for clinical improvement.

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia, now presenting with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors. She has chronic central venous access and her blood pressure runs low (systolic 90s-100s). The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, indicating an infection. The patient has been experiencing high-grade fevers and hypotension, which are poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and require the use of norepinephrine (0.04 mcg/kg/min).

The patient has a history of MRSE bacteremia and is allergic to vancomycin. She has been started on cefepime and daptomycin, and micafungin has been added as per ID input due to her history of fungal infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and a fungal blood culture has been added. The patient will undergo a tagged read cell scan tomorrow, followed by a CT-guided biopsy for diskitis if the tagged scan is positive.

The patient also has leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, with a differential count showing neutrophils at 81.5%, lymphocytes at 12.0%, monocytes at 3.0%, eosinophils at 3.2%, and basophils at 0.5%. Her liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are elevated, as well as her alkaline phosphatase and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of allergies to certain medications and have undergone several surgeries. The patient's condition has been worsening, with elevated CRP levels and positive WBC count indicating a possible infection. They have been prescribed antibiotics, antifungal medication, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as diskitis at L4-L5 based on a lumbar spine CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diskitis: The presence of possible diskitis at L4-L5 suggests an infection in the spine, which can lead to further complications if left untreated.
2. Infection: Elevated CRP levels and positive WBC count indicate an ongoing infection in the body. Failure to control the infection may result in sepsis or organ dysfunction.
3. Medication Allergies: The patient has known allergies to certain medications, which should be taken into consideration when prescribing future treatments to avoid any adverse reactions.
4. Bloodstream Infection: The use of central lines increases the risk of bloodstream infections. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis should be implemented to prevent this complication.
5. Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ICU stay and respiratory support may increase the risk of developing VAP. Early identification and prompt antibiotic therapy are crucial in managing this potential complication.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia. She presents with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors. The patient has chronic central venous access and is currently on antibiotics, including cefepime and daptomycin. Blood, urine, and cultures have been ordered, and the patient is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

The patient also has a history of venous thrombosis and is being continued on Plavix. No intravenous fluids are recommended, and the patient's electrolytes are replete. TPN has been held, and the patient is on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. The patient has a femoral Hickman line for access.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Line-associated bacteremia or sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia, and her current presentation suggests sepsis, which could be related to her central venous access.
2. Dikitis: The patient has possible diskitis at L4-L5, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Venous thrombosis: The patient has a history of venous thrombosis, and prophylaxis with Plavix is being continued.
4. Hypotension: The patient is"

   discuss with ID duration/need
   - will likely need to change femoral line over wire if this seems to be
   a line infection; if no organism is found, will need ID input as to Abx
   therapy.  This is possible since pt was on Abx therapy prior to
   admission
 we may need to determine a course without culture data.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia. She presents with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors. The patient has chronic central venous access and is currently on TPN (total parenteral nutrition). Her blood cultures show coagulase-negative staphylococci in multiple bottles, and she is allergic to vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is presenting with severe back pain and hypotension, which may indicate sepsis. The source of infection could be a central venous line, discitis, or urinary tract infection.

2. Line infection: The patient's history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia suggests that her central venous line could be the source of infection.

3. Discitis: Although there are no clear focal neuro deficits, the patient has severe back pain, and diskitis cannot be ruled out. A tagged red cell scan has been ordered, and if positive, a CT-guided core biopsy will be performed.

4. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which can be caused by medication-induced effects or sepsis. The trend in values will be monitored, and clinical improvement will be watched for.

5. Venous thrombosis: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis ("

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia. She is currently presenting with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors. The patient has chronic central venous access, and her blood cultures show coag-negative Staphylococcus in multiple bottles. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Line infection: The patient's history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia suggests a possibility of a line infection. If this is confirmed, the femoral line may need to be changed over a wire.

2. Sepsis: The patient's severe back pain, high-grade fevers, and hypotension indicate possible sepsis. The source of infection could be the central venous line, discitis, or urinary tract infection.

3. Anemia: The patient has been diagnosed with chronic anemia. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

4. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in the upper extremity. It is important to continue prophylaxis with Plavix to prevent further thrombotic events.

5. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count and platelet count may be due to medication-induced causes or sepsis. Monitoring these values and clinical improvement is essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia. She is now presenting with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors. The patient has chronic central venous access and no clear focal neuro deficits, although discitis at L4/L5 cannot be ruled out. Despite a down-trending white blood cell count, the patient continues to experience high-grade fevers and hypotension. The most likely source of infection is her central line, but urinary tract infection and discitis are also possible sources. Blood cultures show coagulation-negative Staphylococcus in multiple bottles. The patient is being treated with cefepime, daptomycin, and micafungin. Blood and urine cultures are pending, as are fungal blood cultures. A tagged red cell scan was negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line-associated sepsis: The patient's history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia and the presence of high-grade fevers and hypotension suggest a potential complication related to her central venous access line.
2. Discitis: The patient's severe back pain and inability to rule out discitis at L4/L5 indicate a potential complication involving the discs in her lower back.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Given the patient's symptoms and the possibility of a UTI as a source of infection, this could be a potential complication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia. She is currently presenting with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors. The patient has chronic central venous access and is now admitted to the ICU. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis/hypotension/fevers: The most likely source of infection is the central venous line, but diskitis and urinary tract infection cannot be ruled out. Continued input from Infectious Disease (ID) and Neurosurgery (NSGY) is needed for diagnosis and management. Blood cultures from outside show coag-negative Staphylococcus in multiple bottles. The patient is being treated with cefepime, daptomycin, and micafungin. Blood and urine cultures are pending, as are fungal blood cultures. The tagged read cell scan is negative.
2. Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia: The differential diagnosis includes medication-induced causes and sepsis. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts are low. Trending values and monitoring for clinical improvement are recommended.
3. Venous thrombosis history: The patient has a history of failed coumadin use in the past. Plavix should be continued, and subcutaneous heparin should be administered as prophylaxis. A femoral Hickman line has been placed for access.
4. FEN: No intravenous fluids are required, and the patient's electrolytes should be advanced. The diet should be advanced, and the patient should receive subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis.
5. Code status: The patient has confirmed full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line-related sepsis: Given the patient's history of recurrent admissions for line-associated bacteremia and the presence of central venous access, there is a high risk of line-related sepsis.
2. Diskitis: The patient's severe back pain and inability to rule out diskitis at L4/L5 suggest a potential complication involving the spine.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings may indicate a UTI, which can lead to sepsis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Leukopenia: The patient's low WBC count may indicate an increased susceptibility to infections.
6. Venous thrombosis: The patient's history of failed coumadin use and the presence of central venous access increase the risk of venous thrombosis.

The Answer is: The potential medical complications for this patient include line-related sepsis, diskitis, urinary tract infection, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and venous thrombosis."
