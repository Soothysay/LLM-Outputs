   57 y/o M with PMHx of CLL transformed to Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma
   now day 97 s/p allo BMT who was transferred to the ICU with progressive
   MS changes and hypothermia.
   .
   # Hypothermia / MS changes: Multiple possible etiologies in the
   immunocompromised pt s/p BMT,  concern for sepsis given elevated
   lactate, resp alkalosis and new left lower lobe infiltrate.  Pt is high
   risk for aspiration new early ?LLL infiltrate.CNS infection also on
   differential with resp alkalosis and immunocomprimised state.  Pt had
   recent VRE bacteremia and would prefer to remove midline to send for
   culture. MRI shows possible embolic infarcts which raises concern for
   endocarditis as another possible source of sepsis. TSH was low normal.
   CvO2 67% slightly low. Concern for meningitis or other central process
   given resp alkalosis.   Additional concern for med toxicity given hx of
   MS changes with cyclosporine. LP is c/w possible aseptic meningitis.
   Amonia level normal.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently on day 97 post-transplant. The patient was transferred to the ICU with progressive mental status (MS) changes and hypothermia.

The patient's current assessment includes altered mental status, hypothermia, anemia (HCT 22 from 26 this AM), and possible endocarditis given the MRI findings of possible embolic infarcts. The patient also has a recent history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia.

The patient is on multiple antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals, including acyclovir, meropenem, micafungin, ciprofloxacin, and linezolid. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia, with a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius. The patient's respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated lactate levels, which may suggest sepsis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is pending, but it is c/w possible aseptic meningitis. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes and a slightly"

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 57 yo M CLL transformation to diffuse large B
   cell lymphoma, 97 days s/p bmt, GVHD, prior vre bacteremia, transferred
   w/ hypothermia and progressive decline in MS concerning for sepsis,
   drug toxicity.  LP performed yesterday
 aseptic meningitis, with
   elevated protein, 21 wbc with 99% L, and neg gram stain.  Treatment
   dose acyclovir was initiated. He remains hemodynamically stable with
   lactate elevation despite aggressive fluids.  He received prbcs, plts,
   and 2.5 NS.

   whether these results might suggest CSF involvement of lymphoma. We
   also remain concerned that his MS could be [**12-20**] drug reaction (tacro,

   antibx (cipro added yest for double PSA coverage given LLL atelectasis

   continue to hold tacro and etanercept, continuing additional

   keep NPO with aspiration precautions monitoring for fatigue or
   inability to protect airway. Remainder of plan as outlined in resident

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL transformed to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) 97 days ago. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypothermia and progressive mental status changes.

The patient has multiple possible etiologies for his condition, including sepsis given elevated lactate, respiratory alkalosis, and a new left lower lobe infiltrate. He is at high risk for aspiration due to early-stage?LLL infiltrate. CNS infection is also on the differential with respiratory alkalosis and immunocompromised state. The patient had recent VRE bacteremia and prefers to remove the midline to send for culture. An MRI shows possible embolic infarcts, raising concern for endocarditis as another possible source of sepsis. TSH was low normal, and the patient has a slightly low CV O2.

There is concern for meningitis or other central processes given respiratory alkalosis. Additional concern for medication toxicity is given the history of MS changes with cyclosporine. The LP is consistent with possible aseptic meningitis, with etiologies including HSV and other viruses (CMV, HHV, numerous others sent out) vs malignancy-related as 99% lymphs on tap vs drug (chemo/immunosup) toxicity. Amonia level is normal, and lactate is up"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that transformed into diffuse large B cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) 97 days ago and is currently in the ICU with progressive mental status changes and hypothermia.

The patient has multiple potential etiologies for his symptoms, including sepsis, CNS infection, endocarditis, drug toxicity, and malignancy-related causes. The presence of aseptic meningitis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis raises concern for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) or other viral etiologies.

The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 22.2 g/dL and is receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The anemia may be related to blood draws or bleeding.

Additionally, the patient has grade 4 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the skin, bowel, and liver. He is currently on immunosuppressive therapy including Cellcept and Solumedrol.

The patient's current medications include linezolid, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, micafungin, acyclovir, atovaquone, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 35.9°C (96.7°F)
- Heart rate: 99 bpm
- Blood pressure: 117/77 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Mixed venous oxygen saturation: 67%

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 283 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 28 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory values include:
- White blood cell count (WBC): 9.2 K/uL
- Hematocrit (Hct): 22.2%
- Platelet count (Plt): 87 K/uL
- Sodium (Na+): 108 mEq/L

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently on day 99 post-transplant. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), intermittent fevers, and mental status (MS) changes.

24-hour events:
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight due to a decrease in hematocrit from 26% to 22%.
- A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed no obvious vegetations.
- The patient was given a 500cc bolus of normal saline (NS) because fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) was 0.8.

Medications:
The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including pantoprazole, foscarnet, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, metronidazole, micafungin, and atovaquone. The doses and times of administration are noted in the progress note.

Physical Examination:
The patient is somnolent but responsive to voice and follows commands intermittently. His sclera is icteric, and he has dry mucous membranes. His neck is supple, but he has poor effort during breathing, with no wheezes"

   # Hypothermia / MS changes: Multiple possible etiologies in the
   immunocompromised pt s/p BMT,  concern for sepsis given elevated
   lactate and resp alkalosis.  Pt had recent VRE bacteremia and would
   prefer to remove midline to send for culture. MRI shows possible
   embolic infarcts which raises concern for endocarditis as another
   possible source of sepsis. TSH was low normal. Concern for meningitis
   or other central process given persistent resp alkalosis.   Additional
   concern for med toxicity given hx of MS changes with cyclosporine. LP
   is c/w possible aseptic meningitis, etiologies include HSV and other
   viruses (CMV, HHV, number of others sent out) vs malignancy related as
   99% lymphs on tap vs drug (chemo/immunosup) toxicity. Amonia level

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently on day 99 post-transplant. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with progressive neurological changes and hypothermia.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypothermia/MS changes: The patient's hypothermia and multiple sclerosis (MS) changes may be due to various etiologies in an immunocompromised patient who has undergone BMT. There is concern for sepsis given the elevated lactate and respiratory alkalosis. The patient had a recent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and it is preferable to remove the central line for culture. An MRI shows possible embolic infarcts, raising concern for endocarditis as another possible source of sepsis. TSH levels are low normal. There is concern for meningitis or other central process given the persistent respiratory alkalosis. Additional concern for medication toxicity is also present, given the history of MS changes with cyclosporine. Lumbar puncture (LP) results are consistent with possible aseptic meningitis, with potential etiologies including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and other viruses (cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus, etc.), as well as malignancy-related causes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) transformed into diffuse large B cell lymphoma, who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now on day 97 post-transplant. He was transferred to the ICU with progressive mental status changes and hypothermia.

The patient is high-risk for aspiration due to an early left lower lobe infiltrate. There is concern for sepsis given elevated lactate levels, respiratory alkalosis, and the new left lower lobe infiltrate. CNS infection is also on the differential with respiratory alkalosis and an immunocompromised state. The patient had a recent vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia and would prefer to remove the central line for culture. An MRI showed possible embolic infarcts, which raises concern for endocarditis as another possible source of sepsis. TSH was low normal, and CV O2 was slightly low.

There is additional concern for medication toxicity given the history of mental status changes with cyclosporine. A lumbar puncture is consistent with possible aseptic meningitis, with etiologies including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and other viruses (cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus, etc.) versus malignancy-related causes (99% lymphocytes on tap) or drug toxicity. Ammonia level is normal, and lact"

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion

s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 9130**]
s mental status
   has significantly improved on treatment for aseptic meningitis with
   fosarnet to cover HHV6.  This has resulted in the patient receiving
   lots of IV fluid and this, along with his hypoalbuminemia has
   contributed to his being significantly anasarcic today.  We will try
   albumin and lasix to reclaim some of this extravascular fluid.  His
   hypothermia has resolved on broad spectrum antibiotics.  He has a
   primary resp alkalosis, likely due to his altered mental status.  This
   should improve as his mentation improves.  Ongoing Rx for his GVHD
   continues (solumedrol, cellcept, etc).  We will continue to Rx and
   monitor him in the MICU for the present time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) but has had a complicated post-transplant course, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), intermittent fevers, and mental status changes. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient presented with hypothermia, which has improved on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Aseptic Meningitis: The patient had signs of aseptic meningitis, and treatment with foscarnet has resulted in significant improvement in mental status.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 26 to 22, indicating anemia. The cause of anemia is unclear but may be related to blood draws or bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has grade 4 GVHD affecting the skin.
5. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, likely due to GVHD involving the bowel.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient initially had altered mental status but has shown improvement with treatment for aseptic meningitis.
7. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient has primary respiratory alkalosis"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) and is currently on day 99 post-transplant. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MS) changes and hypothermia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/87 mmHg to 150/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is somnolent but responsive, with intermittent ability to follow commands. Physical examination findings include scleral icterus, dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, supple neck, chest with crackles at bilateral lung bases, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and pitting edema in all four extremities, more pronounced in the right upper extremity. Neurological examination reveals an improved level of consciousness.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 67 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 61 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 112 mEq"

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note above by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 347**]
   and I agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 9130**] continues
   to improve from a mental status point of view and hypothermia has not
   been an issue for more than 48hrs.  We appreciate ID input and will
   follow their suggestions to stop Cipro and to eval for CDiff and if neg
   to d/c flagyl.  We will proceed to LP for flow cytometry.  Overall he
   has precious little evidence of worsening infection and largely needs
   close nursing follow up on his current meds, including foscarnet.
   We will thus contact BMT service and propose transfer back to them
   either today or tomorrow. He
ll need swallow eval before allowing him
   to return to oral feedings.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now day 99 post-transplant. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications, including hypothermia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has also had intermittent fevers and mental status changes.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature has been consistently below normal levels. Possible etiologies include sepsis, endocarditis, central nervous system (CNS) infection, or medication toxicity.
2. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): The patient's respiratory alkalosis, elevated lactate levels, and other lab abnormalities suggest possible MODS.
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient has developed grade 4 GVHD affecting the skin, bowel, and liver. He is currently on immunosuppressive therapy.
4. Aseptic Meningitis: Lumbar puncture results indicate possible aseptic meningitis, possibly caused by viral infections like herpes simplex virus (HSV) or other viruses, or medication toxicity.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient shows signs of intravascular volume depletion despite edematous extremities.
6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that transformed into diffuse large B cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently day 100 post-transplant. The patient was transferred to the ICU with progressive mental status (MS) changes and hypothermia.

The patient's hypothermia appears to have resolved with empirical treatment of meningitis, which was suspected due to his immunocompromised state post-BMT. However, multiple possible etiologies for the MS changes are still being considered. 

The patient is also diagnosed with intravascular volume depletion despite having edema, as indicated by a low central venous pressure (CVP) of 7. There is a preliminary finding of right cephalic vein thrombosis but no deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right arm.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been stable at 23.1% for the past two days, and there are no signs of hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient has grade 4 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the skin, bowel, and liver. He is tolerating a clear liquid diet and will have a swallow evaluation soon. The GVHD is being managed with medications such as budesonide, methylprednisol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) and is now day 99 post-transplant. The patient was transferred to the ICU with progressive mental status changes and hypothermia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has elevated lactate levels and respiratory alkalosis, indicating possible sepsis. There is concern for sepsis given the recent VRE bacteremia and the presence of embolic infarcts on MRI, raising concern for endocarditis as another possible source of sepsis.
2. Meningitis or central nervous system infection: The patient's lumbar puncture is consistent with possible aseptic meningitis. Etiologies include HSV and other viruses (CMV, HHV, etc.) vs malignancy-related causes or drug toxicity.
3. Hypothermia: The patient has persistent hypothermia, which may be due to multiple possible etiologies in the immunocompromised patient post-BMT.
4. GVHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease): The patient has grade 4 GVHD affecting the skin, bowel, and liver. This requires careful management with immunosuppressive medications.

   immunocompromised pt s/p BMT,  concern for sepsis given elevated
   lactate and resp alkalosis.  Pt had recent VRE bacteremia and would
   prefer to remove midline to send for culture. MRI shows possible
   embolic infarcts which raises concern for endocarditis as another
   possible source of sepsis. TSH was low normal. Concern for meningitis
   or other central process given persistent resp alkalosis.   Additional
   concern for med toxicity given hx of MS changes with cyclosporine. LP
   is c/w possible aseptic meningitis, etiologies include HSV and other
   viruses (CMV, HHV, number of others sent out) vs malignancy related as

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL transformed to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allo BMT and is now day 99 in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from the information provided:

1. Hypothermia/MS changes: The patient has progressive MS changes and hypothermia. Multiple possible etiologies in the immunocompromised patient after BMT are considered, including sepsis, endocarditis, meningitis, or medication toxicity.

2. Intravascular volume depletion: The patient is intravascularly depleted but edematous. CVP has been low, and the patient had diuresis with Lasix + albumin in the past. Fluid status should be closely monitored, and further interventions may be required.

3. Anemia: The patient's HCT has decreased from 26 to 22, and now it is stable at 23. This may be related to blood draws or bleeding. Two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) have been given. Hemolysis/DIC labs are negative, and AM labs should be followed up.

4. CLL/Diffuse large B s/p allo BMT: The patient is currently day 97 post-transplant with a complicated post-transplant course including GVHD, intermittent fevers, and MS changes. BMT recommendations should be followed up, and medications such as At"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old overweight male with altered mental status, aseptic meningitis, and lymphoma. They were admitted to the ICU with symptoms of lethargy, fever, and headache. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. Their vital signs are stable with a slightly elevated heart rate. They have a negative fluid balance and are receiving nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's mental status has improved over the past 24 hours, but they remain lethargic. There is no evidence of bleeding, and their oxygenation is good. They will be tried off supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to lymphoma and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or worsening mental status, is important.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count (66) may increase the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of the platelet count and careful use of invasive procedures are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, with a minimum reading of 109/60 mmHg. Monitoring for signs of hypotension and adjusting the fluid and medication regimen accordingly is important.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating that they are receiving less fluid than"
