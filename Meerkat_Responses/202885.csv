   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and
   recent radical cystectomy and neobladder who is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension,
   fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)  Since his surgery last month, his
   rate has been very hard to control, but he was discharged on 100 mg
   metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]. TSH [**2-24**] was 3.4. Last echo was [**10/2126**] demonstrated
   LVH and dilated left atrium with low normal EF. He has not been
   anticoagulated, and reports taking an aspirin; he states he was
   supposed to follow up with his PCP to discuss [**Name9 (PRE) 6221**] after
   his surgery, but had not made it to that appointment yet. He reports he
   is aware of the risks of stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation. Wish
   to avoid giving amiodarone unless last resort, as there is risk of
   thromboembolic event should he convert to sinus rhythm.
     --Continue 100 mg [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol
     --Continue digoxin ([**1-17**] loading dose given renal insufficiency)
   - Appreciate cardiology assistance
   - Repleting electrolytes (magnesium)
   - IVF given patient appears to be hypovolemic, bolus PRN hypotension or
   low urine outpu
   # Transitional cell carcinoma: Urology is following patient. His
   incisions appear well. Suspect he likely has infection of his
   neobladder.
   - Irrigate neobladder Q8H
   - Ceftriaxone per urology
   # Hypotension: Resolved with rate control and IVF
   - Work on rate control for atrial fibrillation
   - Ceftriaxone per urology for likely urinary tract infection
   - Blood, urine cultures pending.

 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   [**Month (only) 51**] be developing recurrent illieus or partial small bowel obstruction.
   He did have a large bowel movement yesterday and is passing gas. No
   findings of ascites on examination, no tenderness. LFTs as noted above,
   added on amylase and lipase.
   - Monitoring serial abdominal examinations
   - Lactate pending
   - Patient refused NGT at present, agreed to re-consider should
   abdominal examination worsen, no longer passing flatus, etc.
   - Minimize narcotics when possible.
   # CAD: No active symptoms, no acute EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg once check with urology in AM (ensure no
   anticipated need for interventions)
   - Continue statin
   - On beta-blocker
   # Renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine 0.8-1.0. Today
   creatinine up to 1.6. Not on any nephrotoxic medications. Did not
   improve with IVF, FENA/FeUREA equivocal.
   - Renal u/s
   - Monitor output (stable at present), following creatinine trend
   # Anemia: Hemodilution versus ACD versus hemolysis.
   - Add on LDH, fractionate bili given elevated Tbili yesterday
   # Ankle pain: Patient reports this is chronic secondary to arthritis.
   Given this is causing him considerable discomfort and tachycardia.
   - Morphine IV for now, given question of ilieus/PSBO
   # FEN: Holding PO's given ? SBO. Repleting electrolytes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent radical cystectomy and neobladder. He was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.6Â°F, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 94/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a history of difficulty controlling his heart rate. He has not been anticoagulated and is only taking aspirin.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 29 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's abdominal discomfort is concerning for possible infection of the neobladder, as suggested by the urology team. Irrigation of the neobladder and administration of ceftriaxone have been ordered.

The patient also has a history of small bowel obstruction, with symptoms including recurrent ileus or partial small bowel obstruction. He had a large bowel movement yesterday and is passing gas, indicating that the obstruction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent radical cystectomy, and neobladder. He was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing difficulty controlling his heart rate, and his vital signs are unstable. He has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. The patient's renal function has worsened, and he is showing signs of fluid overload. There is also a concern for small bowel obstruction or partial intestinal obstruction. The patient's medications include metoprolol, digoxin, and ceftriaxone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. The cultures taken will help identify the specific pathogen causing the infection. 
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's heart rate is not well-controlled, which increases the risk of cardiac complications. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications will be necessary to manage this condition.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have significantly increased, indicating impaired renal function. This may require adjustments in medication dosages and fluid management.
4. Small bowel obstruction or partial intestinal obstruction: The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort and absence of flatus, raise"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent radical cystectomy and neobladder. He was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.6, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 123/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 124 mEq/L. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound, but the urology team believes this is expected after his procedure. There are no other significant findings on physical examination.

The patient's medical history includes cancer (malignant neoplasm), small bowel obstruction (including intussusception, adhesions), and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently being treated for suspected urinary tract infection with ceftriaxone, and his medications include metoprolol and digoxin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Stroke: Due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of thromboembolic events leading to stroke. The patient is not currently anticoagulated, and there is a concern about the potential risks and benefits of converting to sinus rhythm with amiodarone.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of recent surgery suggest the possibility of AKI. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this complication.

3. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's history of SBO, including intussusception and adhesions, increases the risk of recurrent bowel obstruction. Monitoring for signs of recurrent ileus or partial SBO is necessary.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and abdominal discomfort may indicate a UTI. The use of ceftriaxone as per urology recommendations is appropriate, but it should be monitored for improvement.

5. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension resolved with rate control and intravenous fluids. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and further management are required.

6. Cancer: The patient's history of malignant neoplasm indicates the possibility of cancer-related complications. Ongoing follow-up with the urology team is necessary.

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has been difficult to control since his surgery. He is currently on metoprolol and digoxin, but his rate remains uncontrolled. The plan is to continue these medications and seek assistance from cardiology.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and it has resolved with rate control and intravenous fluids.
3. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers, and there"

   LVH and dilated left atrium with low normal EF. He has not been
   anticoagulated, and reports taking an aspirin; he states he was
   supposed to follow up with his PCP to discuss [**Name9 (PRE) 6221**] after
   his surgery, but had not made it to that appointment yet. He reports he
   is aware of the risks of stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation. Wish
   to avoid giving amiodarone unless last resort, as there is risk of
   thromboembolic event should he convert to sinus rhythm.

   Code status: Full, discussed with patient
   Disposition:  ICU until tachycardia, hypotension resolved, then to
   floor
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent radical cystectomy and neobladder. He was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7Â°C (101.7Â°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 113/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Physical examination findings include well-appearing and well-nourished appearance, slightly uncomfortable and moving around in bed, irregularly irregular tachycardic heart rhythm, no jugular venous distention, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, soft and mildly distended abdomen with well-healed surgical incisions, warm extremities, and full range of motion of ankles.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and low hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL. Other labs are within normal range.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, osteoarthritis, acute renal failure, anemia, urinary tract infection, C. difficile infection, and a history of cancer. He also has a history of small bowel obstruction.

The assessment and plan include controlling the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control medications, initiating anticoagulation with warfarin, and repleting electrolytes as needed. The patient's urinary tract infection is being treated with ceftriaxone per urology. The abdominal distention may have been secondary to C. difficile infection, and treatment with Flagyl is planned. The patient's acute renal failure is suspected to be due to sepsis, and close monitoring of output and creatinine trend is recommended. The patient's anemia may be due to acute blood loss or chronic disease, and further evaluation is needed. The patient's chronic ankle pain is likely secondary to osteoarthritis, and acetaminophen is recommended for pain relief. The patient's diet will be advanced to a regular diet, and electrolyte repletion will be continued. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of atrial fibrillation, development of further infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection, progression of acute renal failure, and complications related to the patient's underlying medical conditions such as osteoarthritis, urinary tract infection, C. difficile infection, and history of cancer."
