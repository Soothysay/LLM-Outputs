   HPI:
   63M admitted 12 days ago with abdominal pain, fever, E Coli bacteremia,
   septic shock from biliary source. Had perc chole tube placed for
   cholecystitis. Intubated for respiratory failure. Ruled in and echo
   showed EF 25-30% with global hypokinesis. Then developed ischemia of
   RLE leading to right AKA [**3-1**]. Also had lap chole at that time.
   Extubated post-operatively. Post-op amylase and lipase rose and fevers
   returned. Felt to need a MRCP though some concern about glass shrapnel
   in eye so transferred for ERCP.
   Has developed worsening delirium over past couple of days.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted 12 days ago with abdominal pain, fever, E Coli bacteremia, and septic shock from a biliary source. He underwent percutaneous cholecystitis, intubation for respiratory failure, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy with subsequent extubation. The patient developed ischemia of the right lower extremity leading to right above-knee amputation, as well as worsening delirium over the past couple of days.

Medical Complications:
1. Cholecystitis: The patient initially presented with abdominal pain and fever due to cholecystitis, which required percutaneous cholecystitis and later laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
2. Bacteremia and Septic Shock: The patient had E Coli bacteremia and septic shock from a biliary source, necessitating critical care management.
3. Ischemia of Right Lower Extremity and Right Above-Knee Amputation: The patient developed ischemia of the right lower extremity, leading to a right above-knee amputation.
4. Rising Pancreatic Enzymes: The patient's pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) have been rising, indicating possible pancreatic involvement or complications such as pancreatitis.
5. Delirium: The patient is experiencing worsening delirium, which may be related to multiple factors including EtOH and benzodiazepine withdrawal, sepsis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted 12 days ago with abdominal pain, fever, E Coli bacteremia, septic shock from a biliary source. He had a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed for cholecystitis and was intubated for respiratory failure. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global hypokinesis. The patient then developed ischemia of the right lower extremity leading to right above-knee amputation and had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He was extubated post-operatively but developed rising pancreatic enzymes and fevers. An MRCP was planned, but due to concern about glass shrapnel in the eye, the patient was transferred for ERCP. The patient has been worsening delirium over the past couple of days. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's worsening delirium could be attributed to various factors such as alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, or complications related to surgery.
2. Pancreatitis: The rising pancreatic enzymes indicate possible acute pancreatitis, which can be caused by gallstones, alcohol abuse, or other underlying conditions.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient initially presented with cholecystitis, which may have led to the formation of a gallstone causing obstruction and subsequent infection.
4. Cardiomyopathy:"
150822.0,245602,2117-03-05 07:39:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.
   24 Hour Events:
 PICC LINE - START [**2117-3-4**] 07:30 PM
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2117-3-4**] 09:19 PM
   On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]:
   1.       Pt interviewed and examined.
   2.       Spoke to wife [**Name (NI) 142**] on phone.
   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of war injury, abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and fever. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and required vasopressin and norepinephrine. Blood cultures grew E. coli, and he was started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem). A RUQ US showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid. On 2/24, a cholecystic tube was placed for gallbladder drainage.

The patient had NSTEMI on 2/24 with peak troponin of 37.88, and an echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hypokinesis. He also had worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses. On 3/1, the patient underwent RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in the OR. He was extubated on the same day. Post-op, the patient had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with a temperature of 100.8. OSH could not perform an MRCP due to the possibility of shrapnel in the patient's eye from war injury. The patient was transferred to Hospital1 on 3/3 for possible ERCP.

The patient's wife noted worsening mental status and speech slurring since extubation on 3/1. The patient has a baseline speech slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive surgery.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, aspirin, codeine, and an unknown allergy. His last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on 3/5 at 06:40 AM. He was given a banana bag for his history of ETOH.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tmax: 37.3 C (99.2 F)
- Tcurrent: 36.9 C (98.4 F)
- HR: 95 bpm (88-103)
- BP: 152/80 mmHg (99-152/80-84)
- RR: 25 insp/min (16-28)
- SpO2: 94%
- Heart rhythm: SR (Sinus Rhythm)

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total in of 46 mL and a total out of 320 mL. His fluid balance since 19 AM is -274 mL. His respiratory support includes O2 delivery device: None, SpO2: 94%, and ABG: ///21/.

The patient's physical examination revealed no peripheral vascular pulses assessed, no skin assessed, and no neurologic examination performed.

Laboratory results show:
- WBC: 11.9 K/uL
- Hct: 33.5%
- Plt: 647 K/uL"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and fever. He was diagnosed with septic shock and blood cultures grew E. coli. The patient required intubation and was started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem). An RUQ ultrasound showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and a distended gallbladder with a thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid. On the 24th, a cholecystic tube was placed for gallbladder drainage.

The patient had weaning off from pressors but experienced an NSTEMI with a peak troponin of 37.88. An echo showed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global hypokinesis. The patient also had worsening right lower extremity ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.

On the 1st, the patient underwent right knee amputation and cholecystectomy in the OR. He was extubated on the same day. Postoperatively, the patient had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with a temperature of 100.8. Due to the possibility of shrapnel in the patient's eye from war injury, an MRCP at OSH could not be performed. The patient was transferred to Hospital1 on the 3rd for possible ERCP.

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.  If negative, consider MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C for eval of other causes of elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia. PICC
   site appears somewhat red but is not excuisitely painful to palpation.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - keep PICC until after CT today, then d/c in favor of peripheral.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol or
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.  Pt has possible asterixis on exam   Neuro
   exam was difficult with poor participation last evening but more and
   consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially some concern for
   facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior accident).
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - if mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   - start lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating
   ammonia)
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such bad PVD) -
   will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - determine what ASA allergy is.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently afebrile
   at 98.4.  WBCs overall improving from 11.9 yesterday to 11.4 today.
   These findings are likely from prior sepsis, but could be from current
   biliary process.
   - followup blood and urine cultures and C. Diff toxins.
   - biliary workup as above.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if cause of
   peripheral ischemia was progression of chronic PVD or exacerbated by
   effects of pressors.
   - consider plavix (or aspirin if pt found to have no allergy) after
   ERCP today.
   - start statin as outpatient (after transaminitis resolves).
   - talk to vascular surgery regarding amputation stump care.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink 10 days ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Give another bag of D5, folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock from a presumed biliary source. He underwent a cholecystectomy and amputation of the right lower extremity. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he has been weaned off pressors. However, he still has elevated lipase and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). He is being transferred to another hospital for consideration of an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and further management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock/bacteremia: The patient's initial presentation was septic shock due to a presumed biliary source infection. Although his shock is currently resolved, he still requires treatment for bacteremia.
2. Altered mental status/neuro deficits: The patient had delirium likely caused by infection, ICU setting, lab abnormalities, washout of sedating medications, and possible alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. His mental status has improved, but it should be monitored closely.
3. NSTEMI: The patient had elevated troponin levels in the setting of hypotension/sepsis, indicating a possible heart attack. However, his history of severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) may have masked the presentation. He may require antiplatelet therapy.
4. Diarrhea: The patient experienced diarrhea, which could be due to antibiotic-associated colitis or an underlying"
150822.0,245602,2117-03-05 07:39:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

   On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]:
   1.       Pt interviewed and examined.
   2.       Spoke to wife [**Name (NI) 142**] on phone.
   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   Started meropenem.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.
   6.       Pt received some PRN haldol for agitation at about 1:30am

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C, consider [**Doctor First Name **], IgG for eval of other causes of
   elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia.
   - continue ertapenem
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - obtain sensis from OSH.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol
   withdrawal.   Neuro exam was difficult with poor participation last
   evening but more and consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially
   some concern for facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior
   accident), tongue deviation, and seems to be favoring use of LUE though
   cannot get great exam to verify this.
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - Minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - If mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - Would like to start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such
   bad PVD) - will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently 98.4.
   WBCs overall improving.
   - followup blood and urine cultures.  C.diff.
   - CXR.
   - Biliary workup as above.
   - Covering with meropenem.
   .
   # ?Aspiration pneumonia.  Areas of posterior consolidation particularly
   on right side on OSH chest CT report - good location for aspiration.
   Minimal findings on CXR here.
   - review images from OSH scan.
   - Continue current meropenem for now without addition of other
   antibiotics (images now >1week old).
   - Discuss with OSH ?speech and swallow eval - per verbal report,
   nothing in papers.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if was graft or
   arterial thrombus formation vs. global effects of pressors.
   - Consider plavix but will hold off for now with ?MRCP.
   - Needs statin as well.
   - Examine incision site at next dressing change.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink over a week ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  From recent infection and acute stressors most
   likely.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who presented to the hospital with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and fever. He was diagnosed with septic shock and admitted to the ICU. The patient required intubation and vasopressors, and was started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem). An RUQ ultrasound showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder with a thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid. On the 24th, a cholecystic tube was placed for gallbladder drainage. The patient's pressors were weaned off, but he experienced a NSTEMI with a peak troponin of 37.88. An echo showed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global hypokinesis. The patient also had worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses. On the 1st, the patient underwent RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in the OR. He was extubated on the same day. Post-op, the patient had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with a temperature of 100.8. The patient was transferred to Hospital1 for possible ERCP. The patient's wife noted worsening mental status and speech slurring since extubation. The patient has a baseline speech slur partly due to his medical condition and resultant need for reconstructive"

   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.  If negative, consider MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C for eval of other causes of elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia. PICC
   site appears somewhat red but is not excuisitely painful to palpation.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - keep PICC until after CT today, then d/c in favor of peripheral.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol or
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.  Pt has possible asterixis on exam   Neuro
   exam was difficult with poor participation last evening but more and
   consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially some concern for
   facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior accident).
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - if mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   - start lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating
   ammonia)
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such bad PVD) -
   will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - determine what ASA allergy is.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently afebrile
   at 98.4.  WBCs overall improving from 11.9 yesterday to 11.4 today.
   These findings are likely from prior sepsis, but could be from current
   biliary process.
   - followup blood and urine cultures and C. Diff toxins.
   - biliary workup as above.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if cause of
   peripheral ischemia was progression of chronic PVD or exacerbated by
   effects of pressors.
   - consider plavix (or aspirin if pt found to have no allergy) after
   ERCP today.
   - start statin as outpatient (after transaminitis resolves).
   - talk to vascular surgery regarding amputation stump care.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink 10 days ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Give another bag of D5, folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male who presented to the hospital with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and fever. The patient was admitted with septic shock and subsequently diagnosed with E. coli bacteremia. He underwent cholecystectomy and right lower extremity amputation due to ischemia. The patient was intubated and required vasopressin and norepinephrine. He was started on meropenem, which was later changed to ertapenem. An RUQ ultrasound showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder with a thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid. A cholecystic tube was placed for gallbladder drainage. The patient's pressors were weaned off, but he experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with a peak troponin level of 37.88. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global hypokinesis. The patient also had worsening right lower extremity ischemia with no detectable distal pulses. On the third day, the patient underwent right knee amputation and cholecystectomy in the operating room. He was extubated on the same day. Postoperatively, the patient had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with a temperature of 100.8. The patient's wife noted worsening mental status and speech slurring since extubation.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 98.4°F (37.3°C)
- Heart rate: 95 bpm
- Blood pressure: 152/80 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 94%
- General appearance: In minor distress complaining of pain all over
- Skin: Erythematous around PICC site. No other obvious findings.
- HEENT: Asymmetric lower face with scars from previous reconstructive surgery.
- Neck: Well-healed CEA scar.
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
- CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Peripheral pulses intact. No peripheral edema.
- Abd: Distended, tenderness to palpation throughout according to patient's facial expressions.
- Neuro: Alert but disoriented to place (knew he was in a hospital).

The patient's laboratory results show the following abnormalities:
- Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL (elevated)
- White blood cell count: 11.9 K/uL (elevated)
- Platelet count: 690 K/uL (elevated)
- Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL (elevated)
- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 16 mg/dL (elevated)
- Glucose: 105 mg/dL (elevated)
- Total bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dL (elevated)
- Direct bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dL (elevated)
- Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 169 U/L (elevated)
- Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 73 U/L (elevated)
- Alkaline phosphatase: 233 U/L (elevated)
- Amylase: 516 U/L (elevated)
- Lipase: 241 U/L (elevated)
- Troponin T: 0.16 ng/mL (elevated)
- Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL (normal range)
- Phosphorus: 3.7 mg/dL (normal range)
- Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL (normal range)
- Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L (normal range)
- Sodium: 138 mEq/L (normal range)
- Chloride: 107 mEq/L (normal range)
- Bicarbonate: 21 mEq/L (normal range)
- Anion gap: 14 (normal range)

The patient's urine analysis shows the following:
- Specific gravity: 1.005
- pH: 6.5
- Blood: Negative
- Nitrite: Negative
- Protein: Negative
- Glucose: Negative
- Ketone: Negative
- Bilirubin: Negative
- Leukocytes: Negative

The patient's imaging results include a chest X-ray, which shows no acute pathology. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin levels, which may indicate hepatitis. Further evaluation for viral or other causes of hepatitis is recommended.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated amylase and lipase levels, indicating a possible pancreatic inflammation. A CT abdomen with contrast is planned to evaluate for pancreatic inflammation and other reasons for transaminase elevation.
3. Biliary tract infection: The patient's history of septic shock and elevated bilirubin levels suggest a biliary tract infection. An ERCP may be considered to evaluate for retained CBD stone or other biliary pathologies.
4. Myocardial infarction: The patient had an NSTEM"

   Imaging:
   CXR [**3-5**]: Blunting of left costophrenic angle. No vascular congestion
   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.
   Microbiology:
   CDIFF negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), alcohol abuse, and chronic hepatitis C infection. He presented to the hospital with septic shock from a presumed biliary source and underwent cholecystectomy and above-knee amputation. He was initially treated at Hospital 31 and was transferred to this facility for further management of his abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and elevated lipase levels.

The patient's past medical history includes NSTEMI, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%, COPD, and chronic viral hepatitis. He also has a history of polysubstance abuse, including EtOH and cocaine use, but his last drink was 10 days ago.

On admission, the patient had elevated LFTs and lipase levels, which were concerning for retained stone versus leak after his laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A subsequent ERCP was performed, which showed benign papillary stenosis without any stones or leaks. A sphincterotomy was performed, and biliary sludge was extracted. The patient's transaminases, lipase, and amylase levels are trending down.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis secondary to gangrenous cholecystitis caused by E. coli, altered mental status/neuro deficits, NSTEMI, chronic systolic heart failure, diarrhea, chronic viral hepatitis, acute pain, impaired physical mobility, and acute kidney"

   Imaging:
   CXR [**3-5**]: Blunting of left costophrenic angle. No vascular congestion
   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.
   Microbiology:
   CDIFF negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of poly-substance abuse, presenting to the ICU with septic shock from a presumed biliary source. He underwent cholecystectomy and above-knee amputation, and is now off pressors with stable vitals. The patient has elevated lipase and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), which were initially concerning for retained stone or leak. However, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed benign papillary stenosis without stone or leak. The patient underwent sphincterotomy and removal of a plastic pancreatic duct stent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had septic shock initially, and although currently stable, he is still on meropenem until culture sensitivities are available.
2. Altered mental status/neuro deficits: The patient's mental status continues to improve, but he will need ongoing monitoring and lactulose to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating ammonia.
3. NSTEMI: The patient had elevated troponins and CKs in the setting of hypotension/sepsis, but his history of severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and likely coronary artery disease (CAD) may have contributed to a thrombotic infarct. He will need Plavix due to an aspirin allergy.
4. CHF, chronic, systolic, EF 25%-30%, which has been present during"

   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.
   Microbiology:
   CDIFF negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of polypharmacy, chronic alcohol abuse, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic systolic heart failure. He presented to the emergency department with septic shock from a presumed biliary source and underwent an emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy with appendectomy. He was subsequently transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's recent history includes elevated liver function tests (LFTs) post-cholecystectomy, which initially raised concerns for retained stone or bile leak. However, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed benign papillary stenosis without any stones or leaks. A sphincterotomy was performed, and biliary sludge was extracted. A pancreatic stent was also placed but later removed successfully.

The patient's current condition is stable, with improved mental status. He is now off pressors and has been transferred to the floor for possible continuation of care. The following medical complications have been noted during his ICU stay:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient initially presented with septic shock from a presumed biliary source and required aggressive management, including broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has elevated LFTs post-cholecystectomy. These were initially concerning for retained stone or bile leak but were later attributed to benign papillary stenosis.

3. Delirium/confusion:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of elevated liver function tests following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed no stones or bile leak. Sphincterotomy was performed, and biliary sludge was extracted. A plastic pancreatic duct stent was successfully removed using a snare.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, codeine, and unknown medications. He received meropenem antibiotics until the previous night. The patient is currently on metoprolol, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for diarrhea. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has moderate pain in the leg. The patient's pain level is rated from 5 to 13 on a scale of 1 to 10.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's fluid balance, respiratory support, and blood products are also documented.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Liver function tests show increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Amylase and lip"

   Disposition: called out to the floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history with several potential medical complications that can arise. Here are some of the identified complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock from a presumed biliary source and gangrenous cholecystitis. Sepsis is a serious complication that can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.

2. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), indicating possible liver damage or dysfunction. This may be due to factors such as hepatitis, bile duct obstruction, or alcohol abuse.

3. Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack): The patient had elevated troponin levels in the setting of hypotension and sepsis, which could suggest a heart attack. However, it is also mentioned that the patient has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and may have had a thrombotic infarct. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

4. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. This indicates reduced pumping ability of the heart, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.

5. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which could be due to various causes such as infection, medication side effects, or underlying gastrointestinal disorders. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), EtOH abuse, and presented to the hospital with septic shock from a presumed biliary source. He underwent cholecystectomy and amputation of his right lower extremity (RLLE). The patient's vital signs are stable, and he has been transferred to this hospital for consideration of ERCP and further management of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and ongoing infection indicated by positive cultures for E. coli from the gangrenous cholecystitis. It is important to continue meropenem until we receive OSH sensitivities, and then plan to treat for 2 weeks from the last positive culture.
2. Altered mental status/neuro deficits: The patient's mental status continues to improve. TSH and B12 levels are normal, so it is recommended to continue monitoring and reorienting the patient. Lactulose should be continued to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating ammonia.
3. NSTEMI: The patient had elevated troponins (and CKs) in the setting of hypotension/sepsis, although the patient has a history of severe PVD (and thus likely CAD) and may have had a more classic thrombotic infarct. Plavix should be continued, and"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and fever. He was admitted to the ICU for an ERCP procedure and has a history of biliary sepsis and pancreatitis. 

24-hour events include:
- PICC line stopped at 09:00 AM
- Started Plavix for PVD given aspirin allergy
- Metoprolol transitioned to PO at 12.5 mg PO BID
- Continued meropenem course until [**3-9**] due to E. coli on OSH cultures
- Held IVF given PO intake of fluids and adequate urine output
- Still NPO per GI
- Called out in the evening, UOP started to fall off and received 1 L bolus of LR over 2 hours
- Pain at AKA site, morphine switched to dilaudid and pain much better controlled

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, aspirin, codeine, and unknown allergies to heparin sodium and meropenem.

Infusions include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), morphine sulfate, and hydromorphone (dilaudid).

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain and fever.

Vital signs include:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), ethanol abuse, and chronic viral hepatitis C. He presented to the hospital with septic shock from a presumed biliary source and underwent cholecystectomy and above-knee amputation (AKA). The patient is currently in the ICU for further management of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock, and there is still a pending culture of the catheter tip and blood culture.
2. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal LFTs, elevated lipase, and a positive hepatitis C antibody test. There is concern for retained stone or leak after cholecystectomy.
3. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient had elevated troponins and CKs during sepsis, and he has a history of severe PVD, which may have contributed to a thrombotic infarct.
4. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%. He is on beta-blockers and may require an ACE inhibitor.
5. Diarrhea: The patient has ongoing diarrhea, and C. difficile toxin was negative. Further evaluation is needed.
6. Hepatitis C: The patient is newly diagnosed with hepatitis C, likely due"
