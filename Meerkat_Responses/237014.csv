   Assessment and Plan
   54M with PMH bipolar disorder and thyroid goiter, now POD #1 from
   subtotal thyroidectomy, with agitated delirium post-op requiring
   intubation/sedation for airway protection.
   1. Delirium:  This is likely secondary to underlying psychiatric
   disease, where the patient had been NPO for surgery without meds on
   board, waking in unfamiliar surroundings, with multiple dopaminergic
   drugs on board from the surgery itself.  Electrolytes wnl.
   -OG tube placed for delivery of psych meds prior to extubation
   -Haldol and morphine prn for extubation
   -F/u psych recs
   2. Respiratory:  Intubated for respiratory protection
   -Plan to extubate today with the above plan
   3. s/p subtotal thyroidectomy:
   -Routine post-op care per surgery team.
   4. Bipolar disorder:
   -continue phenelzine and lithium. Will check lithium level given
   potential peri-op fluid shifts.
   5. Hypotension: likely due to propofol + hypovolemia peri-op, although
   minimal blood loss and local surgery does not generally entail
   significant fluid shifts. Maintenance IVF + bolus prn for SBP goal >90.

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and thyroid goiter who presented with delirium following a subtotal thyroidectomy. He was intubated for airway protection due to agitation and sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 97/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a FiO2 of 40%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 33.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently taking phenelzine and lithium. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, platelet count of 197 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, total CO2 of 25 mEq/L, glucose of 122 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

The patient's delirium is likely secondary to underlying psychiatric disease, waking up in unfamiliar surroundings, and the use of multiple dopaminergic drugs during surgery. An orogastric (OG) tube has been placed for the delivery of psychiatric medications prior to extubation. Haldol and morphine are being given"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to a combination of factors including held psych medications, anesthesia, and situational delirium with a baseline psych disorder. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. He is also on propofol for sedation, famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/63 to 72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 1,195 mL and output of 280 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CMV/ASSIST mode on the ventilator with set tidal volume of 650 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 33. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, HCO3- of 167 mEq/L, BE of 25 mEq/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 418.

The patient's physical examination reveals normal findings in the eyes, head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, and skin. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to patient's unconscious state. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, platelet count of 197 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide of 25 mEq/L, glucose of 122 mg/dL, calcium of 8.6 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, and phosphate of 3.3 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of held psych medications, anesthesia, and situational delirium with a baseline psych disorder. Propofol will be continued overnight and then weaned to goal overbreaths and comfortable.
2. Hypotension: The patient will receive IV fluids and propofol will be weaned. The patient's urine output is maintained, and there are no signs of end-organ ischemia. The hematocrit will be checked.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient will continue on assisted mechanical ventilation overnight, with FiO2 weaning and confirmation of ETT placement via chest X-ray. RSBI will be monitored, and plans for extubation in the morning will be made.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of delirium. The patient has undergone a subtotal thyroidectomy and is currently extubated. He is conversant but still confused, and his mental status has fluctuated throughout the day. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/45 mmHg to 117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, and glucose levels. Other electrolyte levels are also within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Post-operative delirium: The patient's delirium is likely due to a combination of factors including held psychotropic medications, anesthesia, and situational delirium with a baseline psychiatric disorder. The patient's mental status has improved but is still not safe to go home. It is planned to transfer the patient to the medical floor with psychiatric follow-up.
2. Possible aspiration pneumonia peri reintubation: The patient is currently afebrile, has a good cough, and chest X-ray findings have slightly improved. Empiric antibiotics will be held off unless there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old individual with a chief complaint of delirium. They were successfully extubated yesterday and are now conversant but still confused. The patient has a history of encephalopathy and no known drug allergies. They have been receiving various medications including lorazepam, famotidine, haloperidol, and heparin sodium. The patient's medical, social, and family history remain unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Review of systems shows delirious psychiatric/sleep status. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a slight variation in blood pressure. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device information are provided. Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to the patient's delirious state. Lab results indicate slightly abnormal values in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, and blood glucose levels. Assessment and plan include post-operative delirium, possible aspiration pneumonia, subtotal thyroidectomy wound care, and bipolar disorder management. ICU care details are also provided. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information given, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening delirium: The patient is currently experiencing delirium, which could potentially worsen if not properly managed.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient may be at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia due to their inability to protect their airway during"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and thyroid goiter. He underwent a subtotal thyroidectomy three days ago and experienced post-operative delirium that required intubation and sedation for airway protection. The delirium has since resolved. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/56 to 112/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal neurological examination findings. His blood work shows normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. There are crackles in the right middle lung and right lower lung, but leukocytosis is resolving and there is no evidence of infection on chest films. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's fever curve, provide routine post-operative care, and manage his bipolar disorder with phenelzine and lithium. The patient is ready for discharge home with a prescription for haloperidol or haldol as needed for any potential psychiatric symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The presence of crackles in the right middle lung and right lower lung may indicate a potential respiratory infection or aspiration. Monitoring the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of post-op delirium. The patient's mental status has improved significantly over the past 24 hours. He has no known drug allergies and is currently on several medications including famotidine (Pepcid). The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged from admission, except for the recent surgery. His review of systems is also unchanged except for the noted improvements. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a slight variation in blood pressure. He is receiving respiratory support but is not on oxygen delivery devices. His ABG results are within normal limits.

Lab results show a slight variation in WBC count, Hct, and Plt levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, except for a slightly low TCO2 level. Other lab results including glucose, differential white blood cell count, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. Post-op delirium: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of held psych meds, anesthesia, and situational delirium with a baseline psych disorder.
2. Possible aspiration pneumonia peri reintubation: The patient is afebrile, has a good cough, and his chest X-ray shows slight improvement. His WBC count has decreased.
3. Subtotal thyroidectomy: The surgical wound appears stable, and post-operative care will be provided by the surgical team.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of post-operative delirium. The patient's mental status has improved significantly since admission. He has no known drug allergies and is currently on various ICU medications, including famotidine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/46 mmHg to 121/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving respiratory support but not on supplemental oxygen. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are within normal limits.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of right mid lung field crackles. The patient's physical examination reveals an alert and oriented patient with regular heart rhythm, soft abdomen, and no extremity edema.

Laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Differential white blood cell count indicates an increased percentage of neutrophils.

Assessment and plan include resolution of post-operative delirium, possible aspiration pneumonia peri reintubation, subtotal thyroidectomy wound care, and bipolar disorder. The patient will resume home medications and follow up with the surgical team, psychiatrist, and primary care physician."
