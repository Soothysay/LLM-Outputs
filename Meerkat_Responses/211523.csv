   [**11-23**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram
   The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
   interatrial septum is aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
   prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve
   with severe, posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation, severe
   pulmonary hypertension and an inter-atrial septum that is bowed towards
   the right. Biventricular systolic function looks normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 52 year old female with past medical history of Down's
   syndrome, dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presents
   with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR, with improving
   mental status and hypernatremia today.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains not fully clear
patient at that
   time has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and likely still has
   significant deficit, but would be hard to attribute hypotension solely
   to this source, especially given she was normotensive at outpatient
   visit. Cardiac echocardiogram with severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion. This leaves sepsis as a possibility,
   although source is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] steroid use to make adrenal
   insufficiency more likely. Initially was tachycardiac, but not hypoxic
   to suggest PE with compromised cardiac output; additionally patient is
   already on coumadin making this less likely, especially with
   supratherapeutic levels.
   - Cultures pending, patient given vancomycin and zosyn in ED, but no
   real clear source of infection at present (CXR unremarkable, abd exam
   benign, urine analysis not overwhelming ), stool for c. diff should she
   have diarrhea. LP is a consideration, but has not been febrile, MS
   appears to be at baseline, and would need to consciously sedate to
   complete given patient cannot cooperate with this.
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram as noted above.
   - IVF boluses and IVF maintanence to make up for severe dehydration
   - Levophed as needed should IVFs not improve BP
   - Lactate has returned to [**Location 201**]
   .
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavoiral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.
   - Family [**Name (NI) 161**], will be in today to begin to discuss goals of care,
   as PEG tube may be necessary to meet caloric needs given that patient
   has had ongoing difficulties with PO intake since at least [**Month (only) 779**].
   Patient also has been recommended to get EGD to evaluate her dysphagia
   further, so consideration for completion of this on an inpatient basis
   should be made. Concern is that patient will pull out PEG if placed
   - Supportive care with IVFs, electrolyte repletion (still has
   significant fluid deficit)
   - Working up infectious etiology
   - TSH, FT4 both WNL
   - Speech and swallow evaluation
   - Nutrition consult as patient is at high risk for re-feeding syndrome
   (will need to do calorie count versus Dobhoff for tube feeds versus
   consideration of PEG)
   - Social work consult
   - PT consult once out of ICU
   - Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabalized or as outpatient for further recommendations
   - KUB to evaluate for obstruction, constipation
   - Folate, MV, thiamine supplementation
   - Low dose haldol if needed for help with agitation
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, and history of virtually no
   PO intake for extended period, suspect pre-renal etiology. Baseline
   creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was around 1.0. Improved to 2.4 after 6 L of
   IVFs.
   - Continue to trend creatinine, BUN
   - Urine electrolytes to be sent
   - Urine analysis/urine culture
   - Consider renal ultrasound to evaluate for obstruction or
   hydronephrosis should creatinine not continue to improve
   - VBG to check pH to ensure not acidotic (bicarbonate appears to be
   WNL, however)
   - Will hold any nephrotoxic medications
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix. Water deficit
   is over 8 L, however currently needs fluid boluses to increase
   intravascular volume.
   - Fluid resuscitation with D5LR, then D5 or D51/2NS once no longer
   requiring IVF boluses to maintain BP.
   - Frequent (Q3-4 H) sodium checks
   .
   #) Hyperchloremia: Again suspected to be secondary to severe
   dehydration. No history of diarrhea or other GI symptoms to suggest
   etiology.
   - Using LR for volume resuscitation in lieu of NS.
   #) Elevated troponin: Patient unable to give history if she has had
   chest pain or other symptoms. Slow decline in functional status does
   not support ACS, however could have had event at some point in past. On
   admission CK elevated to 235, with troponin of 0.53, but MB index WNL.
   In setting of renal insufficiency, these are difficult to interpret.
   Her EKG has a poor baseline, and furthermore ST segments difficult to
   interpret in percoridal leads given LVH.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Serial EKGs
   - Continue sotalol
   - Once INR improves and not clearly bleeding, initiate aspirin therapy
   - Transthoracic echo to evaluate for focal wall abnormalities
   .
   #) Elevated lactate: Suspect this was secondary to hypotension (patient
   was not hypotensive in office visit, but unclear what BP has been over
   last few weeks) with hypoperfusion. Abdominal examination is benign and
   not supportive of mesenteric ischemia (no apparent tenderness or
   guarding on examination). Serial lactates have returned to [**Location 201**]
   limits.
   - Re-check in AM
   - Checking VBG to ensure not acidotic.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption.
   - Holding coumadin, received 5 mg vitamin K in ED, following trend
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate in 100's. Will hold
   at this time given risk of worsening hypotension.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis: Could be secondary to occult infection. Work-up as
   noted above, including cultures, transthoracic echo (will concurrently
   evaluate for vegetation), KUB to look for abdominal pathology.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continue home medications, unable to check level
   of Depakote here and trileptal is send out.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Checking TSH/FT4. Continue home supplementation
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI.
   .
   #) FEN: Sips, IVFs, until speech and swallow evaluation. Nutrition
   consult appreciated.
   .
   #) PPx: Supratherapeutic INR, PPI.
   .
   #) Code: Full per ED discussion with patient's HCP's
   .
   #) Communication:
   Brother:
   [**Name (NI) 82**] [**Name (NI) 3637**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3638**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3639**] (? home)
   Per ED discussion with family, she is full code.
   .
   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED.
   .
   #) Dispo: ICU until above issues improved.

   The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
   interatrial septum is aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
   prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve
   with severe, posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation, severe
   pulmonary hypertension and an inter-atrial septum that is bowed towards
   the right. Biventricular systolic function looks normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 52 year old female with past medical history of Down's
   syndrome, dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presents
   with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR, with improving
   mental status and hypernatremia today.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains not fully clear
patient at that
   time has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and likely still has
   significant deficit, but would be hard to attribute hypotension solely
   to this source, especially given she was normotensive at outpatient
   visit. Cardiac echocardiogram with severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause. This
   leaves sepsis as a possibility, although source would unclear
U/A from
   ED was fairly unremarkable, repeat one in ICU with many white (but also
   many red) cells; initial culture contaminated, second pending. No
   steroid use to make adrenal insufficiency more likely. Initially was
   tachycardiac, but not hypoxic to suggest PE with compromised cardiac
   output; additionally patient is already on coumadin making this less
   likely, especially with supratherapeutic levels.
   - Cultures pending, patient given vancomycin and zosyn in ED, but no
   real clear source of infection at present (CXR unremarkable, abd exam
   benign, urine analysis not overwhelming ), stool for c. diff should she
   have diarrhea. LP is a consideration, but has not been febrile, MS
   appears to be at baseline, and would need to consciously sedate to
   complete given patient cannot cooperate with this. Will stop vancomycin
   currently (no indwelling line or other reason to think she has MRSA
   skin or blood stream infection). Will continue zosyn until repeat
   urine/blood cultures are no growth for another 24 hrs (during last
   admission had UTI that was felt to be contributing to failure to
   thrive).
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram as noted above.
   - IVF boluses and IVF maintanence to make up for severe dehydration
   - Continue levophed as needed should IVFs not improve BP, will try to
   wean
   - Lactate has returned to [**Location 201**]
   .
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavoiral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.
   - Family [**Name (NI) 161**], will be in today to begin to discuss goals of care,
   as PEG tube may be necessary to meet caloric needs given that patient
   has had ongoing difficulties with PO intake since at least [**Month (only) 779**].
   Patient also has been recommended to get EGD to evaluate her dysphagia
   further, so consideration for completion of this on an inpatient basis
   should be made. Concern is that patient will pull out PEG if placed.
   - Supportive care with IVFs, electrolyte repletion (still has
   significant fluid deficit)
   - Working up infectious etiology
   - TSH, FT4 both WNL
   - Speech and swallow evaluation completed (difficult to assess given
   patient
s lack of cooperation)
   - Nutrition consult as patient is at high risk for re-feeding syndrome
   (will need to do calorie count versus Dobhoff for tube feeds versus
   consideration of PEG)
   - Social work consult appreciated
   - PT consult once out of ICU
   - Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations
   - KUB to evaluate for obstruction, constipation was unremarkable
   - Folate, MV, thiamine supplementation
   - Low dose haldol if needed for help with agitation
   - Given question of acutely worsening dementia, checking vitamin B12,
   no known risk factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL,
   working on correcting other metabolic abnormalities that could be
   contributing to dementia
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Much improved today, creatinine down to 1.7.
   Given elevated BUN, and history of virtually no PO intake for extended
   period, suspect pre-renal etiology. Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was
   around 1.0.
   - Continue to trend creatinine, BUN
   - Urine electrolytes as noted
   - Urine analysis/urine culture
   - Consider renal ultrasound to evaluate for obstruction or
   hydronephrosis should creatinine not continue to improve
   - Will hold any nephrotoxic medications
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix. Water deficit
   is over 8 L, however currently needs fluid boluses to increase
   intravascular volume.
   - Fluid resuscitation with D5LR, then D51/2NS once no longer requiring
   IVF boluses to maintain BP.
   - Space out sodium checks to [**Hospital1 **] given improvement to 150
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: Patient unable to give history if she has had
   chest pain or other symptoms. Slow decline in functional status does
   not support ACS, however could have had event at some point in past. On
   admission CK elevated to 235, with troponin of 0.53, but MB index WNL.
   In setting of renal insufficiency, these are difficult to interpret.
   Her EKG has a poor baseline, and furthermore ST segments difficult to
   interpret in percoridal leads given LVH.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
improved.
   - Continue sotalol once able to take PO
   - Once INR improves and not clearly bleeding, initiate aspirin therapy
   - Transthoracic echo to evaluate for focal wall abnormalities as noted
   above.
   .
   #) Elevated lactate: Suspect this was secondary to hypotension (patient
   was not hypotensive in office visit, but unclear what BP has been over
   last few weeks) with hypoperfusion. Abdominal examination is benign and
   not supportive of mesenteric ischemia (no apparent tenderness or
   guarding on examination). Serial lactates have returned to [**Location 201**]
   limits.
   - Given still unclear etiology of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] wean off pressors, and as
   long as mental status is at baseline, will tolerate lower BP and
   re-check lactate after off pressors to see if rising.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR to <2.
   - Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently appears to be in sinus, rate in 100's.
   - Will discuss with family goals of care, and start hep gtt for
   anticoagulation if desired; sotalol once able to give PO medications.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis: Could be secondary to occult infection. Work-up as
   noted above, including cultures, transthoracic echo (no vegetations),
   KUB to look for abdominal pathology.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continue home medications, unable to check level
   of Depakote here and trileptal is send out. Giving IV valproate while
   here in ICU
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI.
   .
   #) FEN: Sips, IVF. Nutrition consult appreciated.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt, PPI, bowel
   regimen if needed (would need to be PR given not taking PO
   .
   #) Code: Full per ED discussion with patient's HCP, will further
   discuss during meetingn today
   .
   #) Communication:
   Brother:
   [**Name (NI) 82**] [**Name (NI) 3637**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3638**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3639**] (? home)
   .
   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED. Would ideally like
   to change this out, but would need to consciously sedate patient to
   place subclavian or IJ or PICC; not able to get additional peripheral
   IV
s. Also great concern that patient would pull these out, even with
   restraints as she has repeatedly pulled off leads for telemetry
   monitoring. Will need to discuss further with family and further
   line/PICC per that discussion.
   .
   #) Dispo: ICU until above issues improved (cannot be called out until
   off pressors)
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: As discussed above, pending discussion with family/HCP
   Glycemic Control:  Elevated glucose this AM, will start insulin SS

   The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
   interatrial septum is aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
   prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve
   with severe, posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation, severe
   pulmonary hypertension and an inter-atrial septum that is bowed towards
   the right. Biventricular systolic function looks normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 52 year old female with past medical history of Down's
   syndrome, dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presents
   with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.
   #) Hypotension: Differential includes hypovolemia secondary to very
   poor PO intake for a prolonged period, sepsis from underlying occult
   infection, cardiac shock or secondary to cardiac event in setting of
   elevated cardiac enzymes. No steroid use to make adrenal insufficiency
   more likely. Initially was tachycardiac, but not hypoxic to suggest PE
   with compromised cardiac output; additionally patient is already on
   coumadin making this less likely, especially with supratherapeutic
   levels. Attempted to measure pulsus, but was unable to do so secondary
   to patient repeatedly moving around.
   - Cultures pending, patient given vancomycin and zosyn in ED, but no
   real clear source of infection at present (CXR unremarkable, abd exam
   benign, urine analysis unremarkable), stool for c. diff should she have
   diarrhea
   - Transthoracic Echo in morning to assess for wall motion
   abnormalities, structure, function, effusion
   - IVF boluses and IVF maintanence to make up for severe dehydration
   - Levophed as needed should IVFs not improve BP
   - Trend lactate
   - Cortisol with AM labs
   .
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavoiral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.
   - Will need to investigate and discuss goals of care, as PEG tube may
   be necessary to meet caloric needs given that patient has had ongoing
   difficulties with PO intake since at least [**Month (only) 779**]. Patient also has
   been recommended to get EGD to evaluate her dysphagia further, so
   consideration for completion of this on an inpatient basis should be
   made.
   - Supportive care with IVFs, electrolyte repletion
   - Working up infectious etiology
   - TSH, FT4
   - Speech and swallow evaluation
   - Nutrition consult as patient is at high risk for re-feeding syndrome
   (will need to do calorie count versus Dobhoff for tube feeds versus
   consideration of PEG)
   - Social work consult
   - PT consult once out of ICU
   - Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabalized or as outpatient for further recommendations
   - KUB to evaluate for obstruction, constipation
   - Folate, MV, thiamine supplementation
   - Low dose haldol if needed for help with agitation
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, and history of virtually no
   PO intake for extended period, suspect pre-renal etiology. Baseline
   creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was around 1.0. Improved to 2.4 after 6 L of
   IVFs.
   - Continue to trend creatinine, BUN
   - Urine electrolytes to be sent
   - Urine analysis/urine culture
   - Consider renal ultrasound to evaluate for obstruction or
   hydronephrosis should creatinine not continue to improve
   - VBG to check pH to ensure not acidotic (bicarbonate appears to be
   WNL, however)
   - Will hold any nephrotoxic medications
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix. Water deficit
   is over 8 L, however currently needs fluid boluses to increase
   intravascular volume.
   - Fluid resuscitation with D5LR, then D5 or D51/2NS once no longer
   requiring IVF boluses to maintain BP.
   - Frequent (Q3-4 H) sodium checks
   .
   #) Hyperchloremia: Again suspected to be secondary to severe
   dehydration. No history of diarrhea or other GI symptoms to suggest
   etiology.
   - Using LR for volume resuscitation in lieu of NS.
   #) Elevated troponin: Patient unable to give history if she has had
   chest pain or other symptoms. Slow decline in functional status does
   not support ACS, however could have had event at some point in past. On
   admission CK elevated to 235, with troponin of 0.53, but MB index WNL.
   In setting of renal insufficiency, these are difficult to interpret.
   Her EKG has a poor baseline, and furthermore ST segments difficult to
   interpret in percoridal leads given LVH.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Serial EKGs
   - Continue sotalol
   - Once INR improves and not clearly bleeding, initiate aspirin therapy
   - Transthoracic echo to evaluate for focal wall abnormalities
   .
   #) Elevated lactate: Suspect this was secondary to hypotension (patient
   was not hypotensive in office visit, but unclear what BP has been over
   last few weeks) with hypoperfusion. Abdominal examination is benign and
   not supportive of mesenteric ischemia (no apparent tenderness or
   guarding on examination). Serial lactates have returned to [**Location 201**]
   limits.
   - Re-check in AM
   - Checking VBG to ensure not acidotic.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption.
   - Holding coumadin, received 5 mg vitamin K in ED, following trend
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate in 100's. Will hold
   at this time given risk of worsening hypotension.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis: Could be secondary to occult infection. Work-up as
   noted above, including cultures, transthoracic echo (will concurrently
   evaluate for vegetation), KUB to look for abdominal pathology.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continue home medications, unable to check level
   of Depakote here and trileptal is send out.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Checking TSH/FT4. Continue home supplementation
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI.
   .
   #) FEN: Sips, IVFs, until speech and swallow evaluation. Nutrition
   consult appreciated.
   .
   #) PPx: Supratherapeutic INR, PPI.
   .
   #) Code: Full per ED discussion with patient's HCP's

   Per ED discussion with family, she is full code.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo F with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's p/w profound dehydration.
   Hypotension:  Still requiring some low dose pressors.  Unclear if
   source is all from dehydration or if a second process is present.  Poor
   cardiac output from severe MR may be playing a role.  No clear source
   of sepsis.  Unclear if non-invasive BP's are accurate as she is alert
   and often times yelling with SBP's of 60's.
     -Will wean off pressors and follow lactates for signs of
   hypoperfusion.  Her behavior prohibits A-line placement at this time.
     -D/C vancomycin.  If UCx negative, will d/c zosyn.
   Hypernatremia:  Hypovolemic.  Improving
     -Continue with free water in D5 1/2NS drip.  If continues to improve
   today, switch to Qdaily checks tomorrow
   Failure to Thrive:  Needs GOC discussion.  Patient not tolerating NGT
   placement and may not tolerate PEG placement.  Will try to meet with
   family when able.
      -Continue vitamin support
      -Continue hydration
   Elevated cardiac Biomarkers:  Appears stress related.  No further
   intervention
   AFib:  Currently off of sotalol and coumadin as she is not taking
   PO's.  Will address this issue with family.
   Access:  Currently has femoral line.  Given her behavior, placing an IJ
   vs SC line would be challenging and there is concern that she may pull
   it out.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, presenting with profound dehydration.
- She is still requiring low-dose pressors for hypotension, with unclear sources of dehydration or a second process present.
- Poor cardiac output from severe mitral regurgitation (MR) may be contributing to the hypotension.
- No clear source of sepsis has been identified, and the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure readings is uncertain due to the patient's alertness and sometimes high blood pressure readings.
- The plan is to wean off the pressors and monitor for signs of hypoperfusion through lactate levels. A central line placement is currently not feasible due to the patient's behavior.
- Vancomycin has been discontinued, and if the urinary catheter (UCx) is negative, Zosyn will also be discontinued.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which is improving. The plan is to continue with free water in a D5 1/2NS drip and switch to daily checks if improvement continues.
- Failure to thrive is a concern, and a gastrostomy tube (GOC) discussion is needed. The patient is not tolerating nasogastric tube (NGT) placement and may not tolerate percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.
- Vitamin support and hydration"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo F with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's p/w profound dehydration.
   Hypotension:  Still requiring some low dose pressors.  Unclear if
   source is all from dehydration or if a second process is present.  Poor
   cardiac output from severe MR may be playing a role.
   Also though her RV function was normal she has mod pHTN so perhaps
   overresuscitated and RV distension.
   No clear source of sepsis.  Unclear if non-invasive BP's are accurate
   as she is alert and often times yelling with SBP's of 60's.
     -Will wean off pressors and follow lactates for signs of
   hypoperfusion.  Her behavior prohibits A-line placement at this time.
     -D/C vancomycin.  If UCx negative, will d/c zosyn.
   Hypernatremia:  Hypovolemic.  Improving
     -Continue with free water in D5 1/2NS drip.  If continues to improve
   today, switch to Qdaily checks tomorrow
   Failure to Thrive:  Needs GOC discussion.  Patient not tolerating NGT
   placement and may not tolerate PEG placement.  Will try to meet with
   family when able.
      -Continue vitamin support
      -Continue hydration
   Elevated cardiac Biomarkers:  Appears stress related.  No further
   intervention
   AFib:  Currently off of sotalol and coumadin as she is not taking
   PO's.  Will address this issue with family.
   Access:  Currently has femoral line.  Given her behavior, placing an IJ
   vs SC line would be challenging and there is concern that she may pull
   it out.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease presenting with profound dehydration, hypotension, and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). She requires low-dose pressors for blood pressure support. There is uncertainty regarding the source of hypotension, whether it is due to dehydration or another process. The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension and may have been overresuscitated, resulting in right ventricular distension. There is no clear source of sepsis, and the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressures is questionable as the patient is alert and often yells with blood pressure readings in the 60s.

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's cardiac biomarkers are elevated but appear to be stress-related. She has hypernatremia, which is improving with free water administration. She also has elevated cardiac biomarkers, but these are believed to be stress-related and no further intervention is required.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but is currently off sotalol and coumadin due to difficulty with oral medication intake. There are concerns about access for IV lines, particularly given the patient's behavior and potential to remove any inserted lines. The patient is critically ill and currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dehydration: The patient presents with profound dehydration, which requires"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 52 year old female with past medical history of Down's
   syndrome, dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presents
   with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR, with improving
   mental status and hypernatremia today.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains not fully clear
patient at that
   time has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and likely still has
   significant deficit, but would be hard to attribute hypotension solely
   to this source, especially given she was normotensive at outpatient
   visit. Cardiac echocardiogram with severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause. This
   leaves sepsis as a possibility, although source would unclear
U/A from
   ED was fairly unremarkable, repeat one in ICU with many white (but also
   many red) cells; initial culture contaminated, second pending. No
   steroid use to make adrenal insufficiency more likely. Initially was
   tachycardiac, but not hypoxic to suggest PE with compromised cardiac
   output; additionally patient is already on coumadin making this less
   likely, especially with supratherapeutic levels.
   - Cultures pending, patient given vancomycin and zosyn in ED, but no
   real clear source of infection at present (CXR unremarkable, abd exam
   benign, urine analysis not overwhelming ), stool for c. diff should she
   have diarrhea. LP is a consideration, but has not been febrile, MS
   appears to be at baseline, and would need to consciously sedate to
   complete given patient cannot cooperate with this. Will stop vancomycin
   currently (no indwelling line or other reason to think she has MRSA
   skin or blood stream infection). Will continue zosyn until repeat
   urine/blood cultures are no growth for another 24 hrs (during last
   admission had UTI that was felt to be contributing to failure to
   thrive).
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram as noted above.
   - IVF boluses and IVF maintanence to make up for severe dehydration
   - Continue levophed as needed should IVFs not improve BP, will try to
   wean
   - Lactate has returned to [**Location 201**]
   .
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavoiral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.
   - Family [**Name (NI) 161**], will be in today to begin to discuss goals of care,
   as PEG tube may be necessary to meet caloric needs given that patient
   has had ongoing difficulties with PO intake since at least [**Month (only) 779**].
   Patient also has been recommended to get EGD to evaluate her dysphagia
   further, so consideration for completion of this on an inpatient basis
   should be made. Concern is that patient will pull out PEG if placed.
   - Supportive care with IVFs, electrolyte repletion (still has
   significant fluid deficit)
   - Working up infectious etiology
   - TSH, FT4 both WNL
   - Speech and swallow evaluation completed (difficult to assess given
   patient
s lack of cooperation)
   - Nutrition consult as patient is at high risk for re-feeding syndrome
   (will need to do calorie count versus Dobhoff for tube feeds versus
   consideration of PEG)
   - Social work consult appreciated
   - PT consult once out of ICU
   - Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations
   - KUB to evaluate for obstruction, constipation was unremarkable
   - Folate, MV, thiamine supplementation
   - Low dose haldol if needed for help with agitation
   - Given question of acutely worsening dementia, checking vitamin B12,
   no known risk factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL,
   working on correcting other metabolic abnormalities that could be
   contributing to dementia
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Much improved today, creatinine down to 1.7.
   Given elevated BUN, and history of virtually no PO intake for extended
   period, suspect pre-renal etiology. Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was
   around 1.0.
   - Continue to trend creatinine, BUN
   - Urine electrolytes as noted
   - Urine analysis/urine culture
   - Consider renal ultrasound to evaluate for obstruction or
   hydronephrosis should creatinine not continue to improve
   - Will hold any nephrotoxic medications
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix. Water deficit
   is over 8 L, however currently needs fluid boluses to increase
   intravascular volume.
   - Fluid resuscitation with D5LR, then D51/2NS once no longer requiring
   IVF boluses to maintain BP.
   - Space out sodium checks to [**Hospital1 **] given improvement to 150
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: Patient unable to give history if she has had
   chest pain or other symptoms. Slow decline in functional status does
   not support ACS, however could have had event at some point in past. On
   admission CK elevated to 235, with troponin of 0.53, but MB index WNL.
   In setting of renal insufficiency, these are difficult to interpret.
   Her EKG has a poor baseline, and furthermore ST segments difficult to
   interpret in percoridal leads given LVH.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
improved.
   - Continue sotalol once able to take PO
   - Once INR improves and not clearly bleeding, initiate aspirin therapy
   - Transthoracic echo to evaluate for focal wall abnormalities as noted
   above.
   .
   #) Elevated lactate: Suspect this was secondary to hypotension (patient
   was not hypotensive in office visit, but unclear what BP has been over
   last few weeks) with hypoperfusion. Abdominal examination is benign and
   not supportive of mesenteric ischemia (no apparent tenderness or
   guarding on examination). Serial lactates have returned to [**Location 201**]
   limits.
   - Given still unclear etiology of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] wean off pressors, and as
   long as mental status is at baseline, will tolerate lower BP and
   re-check lactate after off pressors to see if rising.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR to <2.
   - Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently appears to be in sinus, rate in 100's.
   - Will discuss with family goals of care, and start hep gtt for
   anticoagulation if desired; sotalol once able to give PO medications.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis: Could be secondary to occult infection. Work-up as
   noted above, including cultures, transthoracic echo (no vegetations),
   KUB to look for abdominal pathology.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continue home medications, unable to check level
   of Depakote here and trileptal is send out. Giving IV valproate while
   here in ICU
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI.
   .
   #) FEN: Sips, IVF. Nutrition consult appreciated.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt, PPI, bowel
   regimen if needed (would need to be PR given not taking PO
   .
   #) Code: Full per ED discussion with patient's HCP, will further
   discuss during meetingn today
   .
   #) Communication:
   Brother:
   [**Name (NI) 82**] [**Name (NI) 3637**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3638**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3639**] (? home)
   .
   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED. Would ideally like
   to change this out, but would need to consciously sedate patient to
   place subclavian or IJ or PICC; not able to get additional peripheral
   IV
s. Also great concern that patient would pull these out, even with
   restraints as she has repeatedly pulled off leads for telemetry
   monitoring. Will need to discuss further with family and further
   line/PICC per that discussion.
   .
   #) Dispo: ICU until above issues improved (cannot be called out until
   off pressors)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Down syndrome, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.
- She presents with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate, hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.
- The patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated, but her hypotension remains unexplained.
- Severe mitral regurgitation was noted on echocardiogram, but her cardiac function is normal.
- Sepsis is suspected, but the source of infection is unclear.
- Cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving vancomycin and zosyn.
- Failure to thrive and poor PO intake have been ongoing issues, possibly related to worsening Alzheimer's dementia.
- The patient requires further evaluation for potential infection, including a urine analysis and culture.
- Renal failure has improved, but the patient still has an elevated BUN and creatinine.
- Hypernatremia is suspected to be hypovolemic in nature.
- Elevated troponin levels are present, but it is unclear if they are related to an acute coronary syndrome.
- Elevated lactate levels suggest possible hypoperfusion.
- Elevated INR may be secondary to poor nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption.
- Atrial fibrillation is present, but the patient is currently in sinus rhythm.
- Leukocytosis could be secondary to an occult infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of heart disease, atrial fibrillation, dementia, renal failure, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, coagulopathy, and hyperglycemia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable but show some abnormalities such as a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/84 mmHg to 74/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 7,148 mL in and 1,210 mL out, with a total fluid intake of 7,138 mL and output of 1,553 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating un"

   No new micro or radiology data.
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains pressor-dependent and with no PO
   intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated and remains
   levophed-dependent.  Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but
   function was normal, without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be
   contributing to hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is
   sole cause.   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving
   WBC, afebrile state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP
   deferred for now given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Adrenal
   insufficiency as primary cause of hypotension is less likely w/o risk
   factors; had a random cortisol level that was 20.4, though has not had
   CortStim test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.
   -- given negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2) will d/c Zosyn
   -- IVF boluses PRN for hypotension; will defer weaning from levophed
   today given SBP in the 90
s this morning
   -- cont D5 1/2NS for maintenance at 100 cc/hr
   .
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavioral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.   Given family
s report of sharp
   decline 3-4 months ago, would also consider vascular dementia as

   worsening dementia, checked vitamin B12 (was high); no known risk
   factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL, working on
   correcting other metabolic abnormalities that could be contributing to
   dementia.  Speech and swallow evaluation was completed (difficult to
   assess given patient
s lack of cooperation).  Had fam htg with brother,
   [**Name (NI) 1384**], on [**2140-11-24**]; he is still deciding overall goals of care and whether
   to provide a PEG [**Date Range **] for feeding.

   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix.  Improving
   while on IVF supplementation.
   -- cont IVF maintenance fluids with D5-1/2NS
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor

   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Elevated troponin: Patient unable to give history if she has had
   chest pain or other symptoms. Slow decline in functional status does
   not support ACS, however could have had event at some point in past. On
   admission CK elevated to 235, with troponin of 0.53, but MB index WNL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with failure to thrive, dehydration, and hypotension. The patient has been improving with intravenous fluids but remains pressor-dependent and unable to take oral intake. She has a severe mitral regurgitation, but her cardiac function is normal. There is no evidence of infection or sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency is unlikely without risk factors. The patient's elevated lactate, hypernatremia, and elevated INR are thought to be related to her poor nutritional status and hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's hypotension remains unclear. Severe mitral regurgitation could be a contributing factor, but it seems less likely as the sole cause. Other potential causes include infection, adrenal insufficiency, or medication effects. The patient's profound volume depletion on admission has been addressed with intravenous fluids, but she remains dependent on vasopressors.
2. Failure to thrive/poor oral intake: The patient has a history of failure to thrive and poor oral intake, which appears to have acutely worsened. This may be related to her worsening Alzheimer's dementia or a behavioral component. Metabolic abnormalities and vitamin deficiencies should be corrected, and further evaluation for contributing factors such as vascular dementia is warranted.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains pressor-dependent and with no Po
   intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains not fully clear
patient at that
   time has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and likely still has
   significant deficit, but would be hard to attribute hypotension solely
   to this source, especially given she was normotensive at outpatient
   visit. Cardiac echocardiogram with severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause. This
   leaves sepsis as a possibility, although source would unclear
U/A from
   ED was fairly unremarkable, repeat one in ICU with many white (but also
   many red) cells; initial culture contaminated, second pending. No
   steroid use to make adrenal insufficiency more likely. Initially was
   tachycardiac, but not hypoxic to suggest PE with compromised cardiac
   output; additionally patient is already on coumadin making this less
   likely, especially with supratherapeutic levels.
   - Cultures pending, patient given vancomycin and zosyn in ED, but no
   real clear source of infection at present (CXR unremarkable, abd exam
   benign, urine analysis not overwhelming ), stool for c. diff should she
   have diarrhea. LP is a consideration, but has not been febrile, MS
   appears to be at baseline, and would need to consciously sedate to
   complete given patient cannot cooperate with this. Will stop vancomycin
   currently (no indwelling line or other reason to think she has MRSA
   skin or blood stream infection). Will continue zosyn until repeat
   urine/blood cultures are no growth for another 24 hrs (during last
   admission had UTI that was felt to be contributing to failure to
   thrive).
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram as noted above.
   - IVF boluses and IVF maintanence to make up for severe dehydration
   - Continue levophed as needed should IVFs not improve BP, will try to
   wean
   - Lactate has returned to [**Location 201**]
   .
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavoiral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.
   - Family [**Name (NI) 161**], will be in today to begin to discuss goals of care,
   as PEG tube may be necessary to meet caloric needs given that patient
   has had ongoing difficulties with PO intake since at least [**Month (only) 779**].
   Patient also has been recommended to get EGD to evaluate her dysphagia
   further, so consideration for completion of this on an inpatient basis
   should be made. Concern is that patient will pull out PEG if placed.
   - Supportive care with IVFs, electrolyte repletion (still has
   significant fluid deficit)
   - Working up infectious etiology
   - TSH, FT4 both WNL
   - Speech and swallow evaluation completed (difficult to assess given
   patient
s lack of cooperation)
   - Nutrition consult as patient is at high risk for re-feeding syndrome
   (will need to do calorie count versus Dobhoff for tube feeds versus
   consideration of PEG)
   - Social work consult appreciated
   - PT consult once out of ICU
   - Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations
   - KUB to evaluate for obstruction, constipation was unremarkable
   - Folate, MV, thiamine supplementation
   - Low dose haldol if needed for help with agitation
   - Given question of acutely worsening dementia, checking vitamin B12,
   no known risk factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL,
   working on correcting other metabolic abnormalities that could be
   contributing to dementia
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Much improved today, creatinine down to 1.7.
   Given elevated BUN, and history of virtually no PO intake for extended
   period, suspect pre-renal etiology. Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was
   around 1.0.
   - Continue to trend creatinine, BUN
   - Urine electrolytes as noted
   - Urine analysis/urine culture
   - Consider renal ultrasound to evaluate for obstruction or
   hydronephrosis should creatinine not continue to improve
   - Will hold any nephrotoxic medications
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix. Water deficit
   is over 8 L, however currently needs fluid boluses to increase
   intravascular volume.
   - Fluid resuscitation with D5LR, then D51/2NS once no longer requiring
   IVF boluses to maintain BP.
   - Space out sodium checks to [**Hospital1 **] given improvement to 150
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: Patient unable to give history if she has had
   chest pain or other symptoms. Slow decline in functional status does
   not support ACS, however could have had event at some point in past. On
   admission CK elevated to 235, with troponin of 0.53, but MB index WNL.
   In setting of renal insufficiency, these are difficult to interpret.
   Her EKG has a poor baseline, and furthermore ST segments difficult to
   interpret in percoridal leads given LVH.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
improved.
   - Continue sotalol once able to take PO
   - Once INR improves and not clearly bleeding, initiate aspirin therapy
   - Transthoracic echo to evaluate for focal wall abnormalities as noted
   above.
   .
   #) Elevated lactate: Suspect this was secondary to hypotension (patient
   was not hypotensive in office visit, but unclear what BP has been over
   last few weeks) with hypoperfusion. Abdominal examination is benign and
   not supportive of mesenteric ischemia (no apparent tenderness or
   guarding on examination). Serial lactates have returned to [**Location 201**]
   limits.
   - Given still unclear etiology of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] wean off pressors, and as
   long as mental status is at baseline, will tolerate lower BP and
   re-check lactate after off pressors to see if rising.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR to <2.
   - Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently appears to be in sinus, rate in 100's.
   - Will discuss with family goals of care, and start hep gtt for
   anticoagulation if desired; sotalol once able to give PO medications.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis: Could be secondary to occult infection. Work-up as
   noted above, including cultures, transthoracic echo (no vegetations),
   KUB to look for abdominal pathology.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continue home medications, unable to check level
   of Depakote here and trileptal is send out. Giving IV valproate while
   here in ICU
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI.
   .
   #) FEN: Sips, IVF. Nutrition consult appreciated.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt, PPI, bowel
   regimen if needed (would need to be PR given not taking PO

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 52 year old female with past medical history of Down's
   syndrome, dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presents
   with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR, with improving
   mental status and hypernatremia today.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains not fully clear
patient at that
   time has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and likely still has
   significant deficit, but would be hard to attribute hypotension solely
   to this source, especially given she was normotensive at outpatient
   visit. Cardiac echocardiogram with severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause. This
   leaves sepsis as a possibility, although source would unclear
U/A from
   ED was fairly unremarkable, repeat one in ICU with many white (but also
   many red) cells; initial culture contaminated, second pending. No
   steroid use to make adrenal insufficiency more likely. Initially was
   tachycardiac, but not hypoxic to suggest PE with compromised cardiac
   output; additionally patient is already on coumadin making this less
   likely, especially with supratherapeutic levels.
   - Cultures pending, patient given vancomycin and zosyn in ED, but no
   real clear source of infection at present (CXR unremarkable, abd exam
   benign, urine analysis not overwhelming ), stool for c. diff should she
   have diarrhea. LP is a consideration, but has not been febrile, MS
   appears to be at baseline, and would need to consciously sedate to
   complete given patient cannot cooperate with this. Will stop vancomycin
   currently (no indwelling line or other reason to think she has MRSA
   skin or blood stream infection). Will continue zosyn until repeat
   urine/blood cultures are no growth for another 24 hrs (during last
   admission had UTI that was felt to be contributing to failure to
   thrive).
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram as noted above.
   - IVF boluses and IVF maintanence to make up for severe dehydration
   - Continue levophed as needed should IVFs not improve BP, will try to
   wean
   - Lactate has returned to [**Location 201**]
   .
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavoiral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.
   - Family [**Name (NI) 161**], will be in today to begin to discuss goals of care,
   as PEG tube may be necessary to meet caloric needs given that patient
   has had ongoing difficulties with PO intake since at least [**Month (only) 779**].
   Patient also has been recommended to get EGD to evaluate her dysphagia
   further, so consideration for completion of this on an inpatient basis
   should be made. Concern is that patient will pull out PEG if placed.
   - Supportive care with IVFs, electrolyte repletion (still has
   significant fluid deficit)
   - Working up infectious etiology
   - TSH, FT4 both WNL
   - Speech and swallow evaluation completed (difficult to assess given
   patient
s lack of cooperation)
   - Nutrition consult as patient is at high risk for re-feeding syndrome
   (will need to do calorie count versus Dobhoff for tube feeds versus
   consideration of PEG)
   - Social work consult appreciated
   - PT consult once out of ICU
   - Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations
   - KUB to evaluate for obstruction, constipation was unremarkable
   - Folate, MV, thiamine supplementation
   - Low dose haldol if needed for help with agitation
   - Given question of acutely worsening dementia, checking vitamin B12,
   no known risk factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL,
   working on correcting other metabolic abnormalities that could be
   contributing to dementia
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Much improved today, creatinine down to 1.7.
   Given elevated BUN, and history of virtually no PO intake for extended
   period, suspect pre-renal etiology. Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was
   around 1.0.
   - Continue to trend creatinine, BUN
   - Urine electrolytes as noted
   - Urine analysis/urine culture
   - Consider renal ultrasound to evaluate for obstruction or
   hydronephrosis should creatinine not continue to improve
   - Will hold any nephrotoxic medications
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix. Water deficit
   is over 8 L, however currently needs fluid boluses to increase
   intravascular volume.
   - Fluid resuscitation with D5LR, then D51/2NS once no longer requiring
   IVF boluses to maintain BP.
   - Space out sodium checks to [**Hospital1 **] given improvement to 150
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: Patient unable to give history if she has had
   chest pain or other symptoms. Slow decline in functional status does
   not support ACS, however could have had event at some point in past. On
   admission CK elevated to 235, with troponin of 0.53, but MB index WNL.
   In setting of renal insufficiency, these are difficult to interpret.
   Her EKG has a poor baseline, and furthermore ST segments difficult to
   interpret in percoridal leads given LVH.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
improved.
   - Continue sotalol once able to take PO
   - Once INR improves and not clearly bleeding, initiate aspirin therapy
   - Transthoracic echo to evaluate for focal wall abnormalities as noted
   above.
   .
   #) Elevated lactate: Suspect this was secondary to hypotension (patient
   was not hypotensive in office visit, but unclear what BP has been over
   last few weeks) with hypoperfusion. Abdominal examination is benign and
   not supportive of mesenteric ischemia (no apparent tenderness or
   guarding on examination). Serial lactates have returned to [**Location 201**]
   limits.
   - Given still unclear etiology of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] wean off pressors, and as
   long as mental status is at baseline, will tolerate lower BP and
   re-check lactate after off pressors to see if rising.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR to <2.
   - Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently appears to be in sinus, rate in 100's.
   - Will discuss with family goals of care, and start hep gtt for
   anticoagulation if desired; sotalol once able to give PO medications.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis: Could be secondary to occult infection. Work-up as
   noted above, including cultures, transthoracic echo (no vegetations),
   KUB to look for abdominal pathology.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continue home medications, unable to check level
   of Depakote here and trileptal is send out. Giving IV valproate while
   here in ICU
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI.
   .
   #) FEN: Sips, IVF. Nutrition consult appreciated.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt, PPI, bowel
   regimen if needed (would need to be PR given not taking PO
   .
   #) Code: Full per ED discussion with patient's HCP, will further
   discuss during meetingn today
   .
   #) Communication:
   Brother:
   [**Name (NI) 82**] [**Name (NI) 3637**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3638**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3639**] (? home)
   .
   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED. Would ideally like
   to change this out, but would need to consciously sedate patient to
   place subclavian or IJ or PICC; not able to get additional peripheral
   IV
s. Also great concern that patient would pull these out, even with
   restraints as she has repeatedly pulled off leads for telemetry
   monitoring. Will need to discuss further with family and further
   line/PICC per that discussion.
   .
   #) Dispo: ICU until above issues improved (cannot be called out until
   off pressors)

   Disposition:
","Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Down syndrome, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.
- She presents with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate, hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.
- She has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and is still showing significant fluid deficit.
- Possible etiologies for hypotension include severe mitral regurgitation (MR), sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.
- She has been given vancomycin and Zosyn in the ED, but no clear source of infection is present.
- The patient's mental status has improved today.
- She has hypernatremia, acute renal failure (improving), and elevated troponin levels.
- Her elevated lactate is suspected to be secondary to hypotension with hypoperfusion.
- Her elevated INR is likely due to poor nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption.
- She has leukocytosis which could be secondary to occult infection.
- She also has a history of seizure disorder, GERD, hypothyroidism, and FEN.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to severe MR, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to organ perfusion failure and potentially result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome"

   Met with patient's brother yesterday to discuss some [**Name (NI) 3707**].  Informed him
   that patient's FTT is likely due to dementia and that she will probably
   will not be able to feed herself.  He felt strongly that she would not

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, who is currently critically ill in the ICU. She is suffering from profound dehydration, hypotension requiring low-dose pressors, poor cardiac output due to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and possible overresuscitation with right ventricular distension. There is no clear source of sepsis, and her blood pressure readings may not be accurate as she is alert and often yelling. The patient's behavior prohibits the placement of an arterial line.

The patient has hypernatremia, which is improving, and her Failure to Thrive is likely due to dementia, with a discussion planned for possible percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement or transitioning to comfort care. She has elevated cardiac biomarkers, which appear stress-related, and is currently off sotalol and coumadin due to not taking oral medications. If aggressive care is planned, she will be heparinized.

The patient has an existing femoral line, and there are concerns about placing an internal jugular or subclavian line due to her behavior and risk of pulling them out. Her nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures are being managed appropriately in the ICU. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to remain in the ICU."

   24 Hour Events:
   Met with patient's brother yesterday to discuss some [**Name (NI) 3707**].  Informed him
   that patient's FTT is likely due to dementia and that she probably will
   not be able to feed herself.  He felt strongly that she would not want
   a PEG tube but he wanted to try to help feel her himself.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient presents with profound dehydration, hypotension, and poor cardiac output due to severe mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's examination is not consistent with distributive shock, but it is unclear if overresuscitation has occurred, leading to right ventricular (RV) distension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 112 bpm (with a first-degree AV block), blood pressure ranging from 115/73 to 74/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The cardiac biomarkers are elevated, indicating possible stress-related damage. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has a history of failure to thrive, which is likely due to dementia, and the healthcare team has discussed the possibility of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement with the patient's brother. However, the brother is opposed to this option.

The patient's plan includes weaning off pressors as able, discontinuing Piperacillin/Tazobact"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains pressor-dependent and with no PO
   intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated and remains
   levophed-dependent.  Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but
   function was normal, without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be
   contributing to hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is
   sole cause.   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving
   WBC, afebrile state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP
   deferred for now given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Adrenal
   insufficiency as primary cause of hypotension is less likely w/o risk
   factors; had a random cortisol level that was 20.4, though has not had
   CortStim test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.
   -- given negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2); discontinued  Zosyn on [**11-25**]
   and remained afebrile; WBC continues to improve.
   -- will check manual BP to ensure correlating with automatic read
   -- cont D5 1/2NS for maintenance at 100 cc/hr
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently in afib with HR 110- 120
s, occ 130
s even while
   at rest
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, and start hep gtt & coumadin
   for anticoagulation if desired; sotalol once able to give PO
   medications.
   -- will consider adding amio or dig if HR more persistently in the
   130
s or becomes HD unstable
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavioral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.   Given family
s report of sharp
   decline 3-4 months ago, would also consider vascular dementia as
   contributing to (seemingly) abrupt decline.  Given question of acutely
   worsening dementia, checked vitamin B12 (was high); no known risk
   factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL, working on
   correcting other metabolic abnormalities that could be contributing to
   dementia.  Speech and swallow evaluation was completed (difficult to
   assess given patient
s lack of cooperation).  Had fam htg with brother,
   [**Name (NI) 1384**], on [**2140-11-24**]; he is still deciding overall goals of care and whether
   to provide a PEG tube for feeding.
   -- awaiting family decision on PEG tube and PICC line, broad goals of
   care
   -- Working up infectious etiology as above; thyroid studies normal
   -- Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations; might benefit
   from seeing Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1012**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in geriatrics who specializes in early
   onset AD r/t Down
   -- if family decides against PEG (and thus PICC), will consider
   palliative care c/s for possible hospice placement; in addition, will
   do social work consult.
   -- Cont. folate, MV, thiamine supplementation
   -- Low dose haldol or ativan if needed for help with agitation; would
   give ativan 0.25 mg IV given prolonged effect of the 1 mg dose on
   [**2140-11-24**].
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix.  Improving
   while on IVF supplementation.  Sig improved; Na 142 on [**11-26**]
   -- cont IVF maintenance fluids with D5-1/2NS unless Na falls below 140;
   would then switch to NS.
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR to <2.  INR 1.4 on
   [**2140-11-25**].
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Acute renal failure:  resolved.  Likely prerenal; improved to 1.1
   from 3.4 on admission.  Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was around
   1.0.   UCx negative.
   -- cont maintenance fluids.
   #) Leukocytosis: resolved
   #) Seizure disorder: unable to take home meds depakote and trileptal
   b/c PO.
   -- Giving IV valproate while here in ICU
   -- unable to take PO trileptal
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   -- cont levothyroxine 37.5 mg IV QD
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI IV as unable to take PO
    #) FEN: Sips as nursing feels comfortable, IVF.
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt & coumadin;IV
   PPI
   #) Code: Full per ED discussion with patient's HCP

   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED. Would ideally like
   to change this out, but would need to consciously sedate patient to
   place subclavian or IJ or PICC; not able to get additional peripheral
   IV
s. Also great concern that patient would pull these out, even with
   restraints as she has repeatedly pulled off leads for telemetry
   monitoring. Will discuss further with family on [**2140-11-25**]; will need
   conscious sedation for the procedure.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's syndrome, Alzheimer dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.
- She presented with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate, hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.
- The patient has been improving with IV fluids but remains pressor-dependent and unable to take oral medications.
- Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is still unclear. The patient appears to be profoundly volume depleted but has been resuscitated. She is currently on levophed, a medication used to maintain blood pressure.
- Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 110-120 beats per minute. She is currently not receiving any anti-arrhythmic medication.
- Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: The patient has a history of failure to thrive and poor oral intake, which has been an ongoing issue for months. This may be related to worsening Alzheimer's dementia or vascular dementia.
- Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels are suspected to be due to hypovolemia, possibly exacerbated by the patient's home dose of lasix. The sodium levels have improved with IV fluids.
- Elevated INR: The patient's INR was initially elevated, but it has normalized after receiving IV"

   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains pressor-dependent and with no PO
   intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated and remains
   levophed-dependent.  Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but
   function was normal, without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be
   contributing to hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is
   sole cause.   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving
   WBC, afebrile state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP
   deferred for now given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Adrenal
   insufficiency as primary cause of hypotension is less likely w/o risk
   factors; had a random cortisol level that was 20.4, though has not had
   CortStim test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.
   -- given negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2) will d/c Zosyn
   -- IVF boluses PRN for hypotension; will defer weaning from levophed
   today given SBP in the 90
s this morning
   -- cont D5 1/2NS for maintenance at 100 cc/hr
   .
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit

   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix.  Improving
   while on IVF supplementation.
   -- cont IVF maintenance fluids with D5-1/2NS
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR to <2.  INR 1.4 on
   [**2140-11-25**].
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Elevated troponin: Patient unable to give history if she has had
   chest pain or other symptoms. Slow decline in functional status does
   not support ACS, however could have had event at some point in past. On
   admission CK elevated to 235, with troponin of 0.53, but MB index WNL.
   In setting of renal insufficiency, these are difficult to interpret.
   Her EKG has a poor baseline, and furthermore ST segments difficult to
   interpret in percoridal leads given LVH.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
improved.
   - Continue sotalol once able to take PO
   - Once INR improves and not clearly bleeding, initiate aspirin therapy.
   #) Acute renal failure:  resolved.  Likely prerenal; improved to 1.1
   from 3.4 on admission.  Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was around
   1.0.   UCx negative.
   -- cont maintenance fluids.
   #) Elevated lactate: resolved.
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently appears to be in sinus, rate in 100's.
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, and start hep gtt & coumadin
   for anticoagulation if desired; sotalol once able to give PO
   medications.
   #) Leukocytosis: resolving; 14.1 on admission; 10.1 on [**2140-11-25**]
   #) Seizure disorder: unable to take home meds depakote and trileptal
   b/c PO.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease who presented with profound dehydration. She is still requiring low-dose pressors due to hypotension, which could be secondary to dehydration or another underlying process. The patient's cardiac output is poor, and there may be distributive shock or severe mitral regurgitation involved. The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension, raising concerns about overresuscitation and right ventricular distension. There is no clear source of sepsis, and the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure readings is uncertain as the patient is alert and often yelling with systolic blood pressures in the 60s.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia that has since resolved. She also has failure to thrive, for which ongoing vitamin support and hydration will be continued. The patient has atrial fibrillation, currently off sotalol and coumadin due to her refusal of oral medications. She is experiencing occasional rapid ventricular response. The plan is to assess heart rate as weaning down levophed and consider an amiodarone load if persistent RVR is a problem.

The patient has hypothyroidism, which is being managed with IV replacement. Access to the patient's veins is challenging due to her behavior, making it difficult to place an internal jugular line or subclavian line. PICC placement with conscious sedation is needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires low-dose pressors, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be due to severe dehydration or another underlying cause such as septic shock or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation or vasopressor adjustment will be necessary.
2. Distributive Shock: The patient exhibits signs consistent with distributive shock, which can be caused by severe sepsis, anaphylaxis, or other systemic inflammatory responses. Prompt identification and treatment of the underlying cause will be crucial.
3. Cardiac Output: The patient's poor cardiac output may be attributed to severe mitral regurgitation or distributive shock. Further evaluation of cardiac function through echocardiography or other imaging modalities may be warranted.
4. Overresuscitation: The patient's moderate pulmonary hypertension raises concerns about overresuscitation leading to right ventricular distension. Careful monitoring of fluid status and avoidance of excessive fluid administration will be necessary.
5. Sepsis: The lack of a clear source of infection makes sepsis a potential concern. Regular reassessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms will aid in early detection and management of sepsis.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient initially presented with hypernatremia, which has since resolved. However, ongoing monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential to prevent future imbalances.
7. Failure to Thrive: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains pressor-dependent and with no PO
   intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated.  Was off pressors
   during day, but had mild hypotensio o/n and levophed put back on.
   Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause.
   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving WBC, afebrile
   state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP deferred for now
   given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Had negative CortStim
   test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.
   -- given negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2); discontinued  Zosyn on [**11-25**]
   and remained afebrile; WBC normalized
   -- Manual BP to ensure correlates with automatic read
   -- cont D5 1/2NS for maintenance at 100 cc/hr
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently in afib , on [**2140-11-26**], had  HR 110- 120
s, occ
   130
s even while at rest
   --loaded amiodarone IV, need to discuss how to give it given her lack
   of PO intake
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, and start hep gtt & coumadin
   for anticoagulation if desired; sotalol once able to give PO
   medications.
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavioral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.   Given family
s report of sharp
   decline 3-4 months ago, would also consider vascular dementia as
   contributing to (seemingly) abrupt decline.  Given question of acutely
   worsening dementia, checked vitamin B12 (was high); no known risk
   factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL, working on
   correcting other metabolic abnormalities that could be contributing to
   dementia.  Speech and swallow evaluation was completed (difficult to
   assess given patient
s lack of cooperation).  Had fam htg with brother,
   [**Name (NI) 1384**], on [**2140-11-24**]; he is still deciding overall goals of care and whether
   to provide a PEG tube for feeding.
   -- awaiting family decision on PEG tube and PICC line, broad goals of
   care
   -- Working up infectious etiology as above; thyroid studies normal
   -- Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations; might benefit
   from seeing Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1012**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in geriatrics who specializes in early
   onset AD r/t Down
   -- if family decides against PEG (and thus PICC), will consider
   palliative care c/s for possible hospice placement; in addition, will
   do social work consult.
   -- Cont. folate, MV, thiamine supplementation
   -- Low dose haldol or ativan if needed for help with agitation; would
   give ativan 0.25 mg IV given prolonged effect of the 1 mg dose on
   [**2140-11-24**].
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix.  Improving
   while on IVF supplementation.  Sig improved; Na normalized
   -- cont IVF maintenance fluids with D5-1/2NS
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR to <2.  .
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Acute renal failure:  resolved.  Likely prerenal; improved with
   fluids.  Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was less than 1.0.   UCx
   negative.
   -- cont maintenance fluids.
   #) Leukocytosis: resolved
   #) Seizure disorder: unable to take home meds depakote and trileptal
   b/c PO.
   -- Giving IV valproate while here in ICU
   -- unable to take PO trileptal
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   -- cont levothyroxine 37.5 mg IV QD
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI IV as unable to take PO
    #) FEN: Sips as nursing feels comfortable, IVF.
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt & coumadin;IV
   PPI
   #) Code: Full per ED discussion with patient's HCP
   #) Communication:
   Brother: [**Name (NI) 82**] [**Name (NI) 3637**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3638**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3639**] (? home)
   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED. Would ideally like
   to change this out, but would need to consciously sedate patient to
   place subclavian or IJ or PICC; not able to get additional peripheral
   IV
s. Also great concern that patient would pull these out, even with
   restraints as she has repeatedly pulled off leads for telemetry
   monitoring. Will discuss further with family; will need conscious
   sedation for the procedure.

   Urine [**11-23**] - ng (final)
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains pressor-dependent and with no PO
   intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated.  Was off pressors
   during day, but had mild hypotensio o/n and levophed put back on.
   Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause.
   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving WBC, afebrile
   state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP deferred for now
   given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Had negative CortStim
   test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.
   -- given negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2); discontinued  Zosyn on [**11-25**]
   and remained afebrile; WBC normalized
   -- Manual BP to ensure correlates with automatic read
   -- cont D5 1/2NS for maintenance at 100 cc/hr
   -- wean levophed as tolerated
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently in afib , on [**2140-11-26**], had  HR 110- 120
s, occ
   130
s even while at rest
   --loading amiodarone IV; cannot give oral at this time.
   -- Ongoing discussion with family re:  goals of care, and start hep gtt
   & coumadin for anticoagulation if plans for feeding tube; sotalol if
   ever able to give PO medications.
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavioral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.   Given family
s report of sharp
   decline 3-4 months ago, would also consider vascular dementia as
   contributing to (seemingly) abrupt decline.  Given question of acutely
   worsening dementia, checked vitamin B12 (was high); no known risk
   factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL, other  metabolic
   abnormalities could corrected.  Speech and swallow evaluation was
   completed (difficult to assess given patient
s lack of cooperation).
   Had fam htg with brother, [**Name (NI) 1384**], and his wife; he is still deciding
   overall goals of care and whether to provide a PEG tube for feeding.
   -- awaiting family decision on PEG tube and PICC line, broad goals of
   care
   -- Working up infectious etiology as above- negative w/u to date
   --thyroid studies normal
   -- Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations; might benefit
   from seeing Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1012**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in geriatrics who specializes in early
   onset AD r/t Down
   -- if family decides against PEG (and thus PICC), will consider
   palliative care c/s for possible hospice placement; in addition, will
   do social work consult.
   -- Cont. folate, MV, thiamine supplementation via banana bag daily
   -- Low dose haldol or ativan if needed for help with agitation; would
   give ativan 0.25 or 0.5 mg IV given prolonged effect of the 1 mg dose
   on [**2140-11-24**].
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix.  Resolved with
   hydration,  Na normalized
   -- cont IVF maintenance fluids with D5-1/2NS
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR t.
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Acute renal failure:  resolved.  Likely prerenal; improved with
   fluids.  Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was less than 1.0.   UCx
   negative.
   -- cont maintenance fluids.
   #) Leukocytosis: resolved
   #) Seizure disorder: unable to take home meds depakote and trileptal
   b/c PO.
   -- Giving IV valproate while here in ICU
   -- unable to take PO trileptal
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   -- cont levothyroxine 37.5 mg IV QD
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI IV as unable to take PO
    #) FEN: Sips as nursing feels comfortable, IVF.
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt & coumadin;IV
   PPI
   #) Code: Full per discussion with patient's HCP
   #) Communication:
   Brother: [**Name (NI) 82**] [**Name (NI) 3637**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3638**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3639**] (? home)
   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED. Would ideally like
   to change this out, but would need to consciously sedate patient to
   place subclavian or IJ or PICC; not able to get additional peripheral
   IV
s. Also great concern that patient would pull these out, even with
   restraints as she has repeatedly pulled off leads for telemetry
   monitoring. Will discuss further with family; will need conscious
   sedation for the procedure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate, hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR. The patient's condition has been improving with IVF, but she remains pressor-dependent and has no PO intake. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The etiology of hypotension remains unclear. The patient is profoundly volume depleted on admission and has been resuscitated. She was off pressors during the day but had mild hypotension overnight and was put back on levophed. Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) was found on cardiac echocardiogram, but the function was normal without pericardial effusion. Severe MR could be contributing to hypotension, but it seems less likely that this is the sole cause.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and on amiodarone IV. She had a heart rate of 110-120 bpm, occasionally reaching 130 bpm even while at rest.

3. Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: The patient has a history of failure to thrive and poor oral intake, which appears to have acutely worsened. There seems to be a behavioral component in the setting of possibly worsening Alzheimer's dementia. Given the family's"

   -Continue amio load
   Hypothyroid:  Now on IV replacement.
   Access:  Currently has femoral line.  Given her behavior, placing an IJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease who presented with profound dehydration and hypotension. She required low-dose pressors overnight but hopefully can come off them today. There is no clear source of sepsis, and the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure readings is uncertain as the patient is alert and often yelling with systolic blood pressures in the 60s.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (AF), hypothyroidism, and failure to thrive. She is currently off of sotalol and coumadin due to refusal of oral medications, but she is being treated with amiodarone for rapid ventricular response. Her electrolytes show hypernatremia, which has been resolved. She has a history of allergies to oxycodone and unknown allergies.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a current temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), a heart rate of 95 bpm (with normal limits of 92-127 bpm), a blood pressure of 93/73 mmHg (with normal limits of 77-108/91 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (with normal limits of 12-23 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 99%.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo F with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's p/w profound dehydration.
   Hypotension:  Required some low dose pressors overnight but can
   hopefully come off today.  No clear source of sepsis.  Unclear if
   non-invasive BP's are accurate as she is alert and often yelling with
   SBP's of 60's.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim normal.
     -Her behavior prohibits A-line placement at this time.
     -Wean pressors as able
   Hypernatremia:  Hypovolemic.  Resolved
     -Continue with D5 1/2 NS maintenance fluids
   Failure to Thrive:  Spoke with patient's sister-in-law at length
   [**Name (NI) 1786**].  She and pt's brother will meet with us again today regarding
   ultimate GOC.
   -Continue vitamin support
   -Continue hydration
   AFib:  Currently off of sotalol and coumadin as she is not taking
   PO's.  Having some RVR requiring amio overnight with improved rates.
   -Will assess HR as we wean down levophed
   -Continue amio load
   Hypothyroid:  Now on IV replacement.
   Access:  Currently has femoral line.  Given her behavior, placing an IJ
   vs SC line would be challenging and there is concern that she may pull
   it out.  [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC with conscious sedation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease who is currently in the ICU. She is suffering from profound dehydration, hypotension, hypernatremia, failure to thrive, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and hypothyroidism. 

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Profound dehydration: The patient has signs of significant fluid loss, leading to dehydration. She is receiving intravenous fluids to address this issue.

2. Hypotension: The patient required low-dose pressors overnight to maintain stable blood pressure. It is planned to wean off the pressors as her condition improves.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in her blood, indicating possible electrolyte imbalance. Her dehydration has been resolved, and maintenance fluids are being administered.

4. Failure to thrive: The patient's history suggests she is not meeting her nutritional needs adequately. Vitamin support and continued hydration are being provided.

5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing irregular heart rhythm. She is currently off sotalol and coumadin due to her refusal of oral medications. Amiodarone has been initiated to manage the rapid ventricular response.

6. Hypothyroidism: The patient is now receiving intravenous thyroid hormone replacement.

7. Access issues: Due to the patient's agitation and behavior, placing an internal jugular line or subclavian line"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains intermittently pressor-dependent and
   with no PO intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated.  Was off pressors
   during day, but had mild hypotensio o/n and levophed put back on.
   Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause.
   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving WBC, afebrile
   state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP deferred for now
   given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Had negative CortStim
   test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.
   -- given negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2); discontinued  Zosyn on [**11-25**]
   and remained afebrile; WBC normalized
   -- Manual BP to ensure correlates with automatic read
   -- will trial lasix 20mg IV for diuresis to help reduce preload given
   severe MR
   -- wean levophed as tolerated
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient on sotalol and coumadin as outpatient.
   Currently in afib , on [**2140-11-26**], had  HR 110- 120
s, occ 130
s even while
   at rest
   --loading amiodarone IV x 9 days since1/3/09; cannot give oral at this
   time.
   -- Ongoing discussion with family re:  goals of care, and start hep gtt
   & coumadin for anticoagulation if plans for feeding tube; sotalol if
   ever able to give PO medications.
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavioral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.   Given family
s report of sharp
   decline 3-4 months ago, would also consider vascular dementia as
   contributing to (seemingly) abrupt decline.  Given question of acutely
   worsening dementia, checked vitamin B12 (was high); no known risk
   factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL, other  metabolic
   abnormalities were corrected.  Speech and swallow evaluation was
   completed (difficult to assess given patient
s lack of cooperation).
   Had fam htg with brother, [**Name (NI) 1384**], and his wife; he is still deciding
   overall goals of care and whether to provide a PEG tube for feeding.
   -- awaiting family decision on PEG tube broad goals of care
   --will need PICC for accesss; need to remove fem line
   -- Working up infectious etiology as above- negative w/u to date
   --thyroid studies normal
   -- Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations; might benefit
   from seeing Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1012**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in geriatrics who specializes in early
   onset AD r/t Down
   -- if family decides against PEG will consider palliative care c/s for
   possible hospice placement; in addition, will do social work consult.
   -- Cont MV
   -- Low dose haldol or ativan if needed for help with agitation; would
   give ativan 0.25 or 0.5 mg IV given prolonged effect of the 1 mg dose
   on [**2140-11-24**].
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix.  Resolved with
   hydration,  Na normalized.
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR.
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Acute renal failure:  resolved.  Likely prerenal; resolved with
   fluids.   UCx negative.  Still poor urine output
   -- trial of lasix to improve urine output
   #) Leukocytosis: resolved
   #) Seizure disorder: unable to take home meds depakote and trileptal
   b/c PO.
   -- Giving IV valproate while here in ICU; check level
   -- unable to take PO trileptal
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   -- cont levothyroxine 37.5 mg IV QD
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI IV as unable to take PO
    #) FEN: Sips as nursing feels comfortable, IVF.
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt & coumadin;IV
   PPI
   #) Code: Full per discussion with patient's HCP
   #) Communication:
   Brother: [**Name (NI) 82**] [**Name (NI) 3637**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3638**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3639**] (? home)
   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED  Needs to be
   replaced.  Spoke to family about PICC and they understant this would
   need to be placed with sedation.   Will replace today with IV sedation

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She presented with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate, hypernatremia, hypotension, and a supratherapeutic INR. The patient has been improving with IV fluids but remains intermittently pressor-dependent and without PO intake.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: The etiology of the hypotension is still unclear. The patient was profoundly volume depleted on admission but has been resuscitated. She was off pressors during the day but had mild hypotension overnight and was put back on levophed. Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) was found on cardiac echocardiogram, but her cardiac function was normal without pericardial effusion. Severe MR could be contributing to the hypotension, but it seems less likely to be the sole cause. There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving WBC, afebrile state, nothing localizing, and no positive culture data. A lumbar puncture (LP) has been deferred for now given that the mental status appears to be at baseline. The patient had a negative CortStim test.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains pressor-dependent and with no PO
   intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated.  Was off pressors
   during day, but had mild hypotensio o/n and levophed put back on.
   Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause.
   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving WBC, afebrile
   state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP deferred for now
   given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Had negative CortStim
   test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.
   -- given negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2); discontinued  Zosyn on [**11-25**]
   and remained afebrile; WBC normalized
   -- Manual BP to ensure correlates with automatic read
   -- cont D5 1/2NS for maintenance at 100 cc/hr
   -- wean levophed as tolerated
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient listed as on sotalol and coumadin as
   outpatient. Currently in afib , on [**2140-11-26**], had  HR 110- 120
s, occ
   130
s even while at rest
   --loading amiodarone IV x 9 days since1/3/09; cannot give oral at this
   time.
   -- Ongoing discussion with family re:  goals of care, and start hep gtt
   & coumadin for anticoagulation if plans for feeding tube; sotalol if
   ever able to give PO medications.
   #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavioral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.   Given family
s report of sharp
   decline 3-4 months ago, would also consider vascular dementia as
   contributing to (seemingly) abrupt decline.  Given question of acutely
   worsening dementia, checked vitamin B12 (was high); no known risk
   factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL, other  metabolic
   abnormalities were corrected.  Speech and swallow evaluation was
   completed (difficult to assess given patient
s lack of cooperation).
   Had fam htg with brother, [**Name (NI) 1384**], and his wife; he is still deciding
   overall goals of care and whether to provide a PEG tube for feeding.
   -- awaiting family decision on PEG tube broad goals of care
   --will need PICC for accesss; need to remove fem line
   -- Working up infectious etiology as above- negative w/u to date
   --thyroid studies normal
   -- Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations; might benefit
   from seeing Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1012**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in geriatrics who specializes in early
   onset AD r/t Down
   -- if family decides against PEG will consider palliative care c/s for
   possible hospice placement; in addition, will do social work consult.
   -- Cont. folate, MV, thiamine supplementation via banana bag daily
   -- Low dose haldol or ativan if needed for help with agitation; would
   give ativan 0.25 or 0.5 mg IV given prolonged effect of the 1 mg dose
   on [**2140-11-24**].
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix.  Resolved with
   hydration,  Na normalized
   -- cont IVF maintenance fluids with D5-1/2NS
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR t.
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Acute renal failure:  resolved.  Likely prerenal; improved with
   fluids.  Baseline creatinine from [**7-/2140**] was less than 1.0.   UCx
   negative.  Still poor urine output
   -- cont maintenance fluids.
   #) Leukocytosis: resolved
   #) Seizure disorder: unable to take home meds depakote and trileptal
   b/c PO.
   -- Giving IV valproate while here in ICU
   -- unable to take PO trileptal
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   -- cont levothyroxine 37.5 mg IV QD
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI IV as unable to take PO
    #) FEN: Sips as nursing feels comfortable, IVF.
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt & coumadin;IV
   PPI
   #) Code: Full per discussion with patient's HCP
   #) Communication:
   Brother: [**Name (NI) 82**] [**Name (NI) 3637**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3638**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3639**] (? home)
   #) Access: Right femoral central line placed in ED  Needs to be
   replaced.  Spoke to family about PICC and they understant this would
   need to be placed with sedation

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She presented with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate, hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR. The patient has been improving with IVF but remains pressor-dependent and without PO intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypotension: The etiology of hypotension is unclear. The patient is profoundly volume depleted on admission, but has been resuscitated. Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) was found on cardiac echocardiogram, but the function was normal without pericardial effusion. It is possible that severe MR could be contributing to hypotension, although it seems less likely that this is the sole cause. There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving WBC, afebrile state, nothing localizing, and no positive Cx data. Manual BP measurement should be correlated with automatic read.

2) Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, on [**2140-11-26**], with a heart rate of 110-120 beats per minute, occasionally reaching up to 130 beats per minute even at rest. The patient is on amiodarone IV for 9 days since 1/3/09; oral administration is not possible at this time. Discussion with the family regarding goals of care is ongoing, and start of heparin gtt and coumadin for anticoagulation if plans for feeding tube; sotalol if ever able to give PO medications.

3) Failure to Thrive/ Poor PO Intake: The patient's failure to thrive and poor PO intake have been ongoing issues for months and have acutely worsened. There appears to be at least some behavioral component in the setting of possibly worsening Alzheimer's dementia. Given the family's report of a sharp decline 3-4 months ago, vascular dementia could also be contributing to the (seemingly) abrupt decline. Vitamin B12 was checked, and it was high; no known risk factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH was within normal limits, and other metabolic abnormalities were corrected. A speech and swallow evaluation was completed, but it was difficult to assess due to the patient's lack of cooperation.

4) Hypernatremia: Hypernatremia is suspected to be hypovolemic given the patient's history, exam, and lack of improvement with continued home dose of lasix. It has resolved with hydration, and the Na level has normalized. Maintenance fluids with D5-1/2NS should be continued.

5) Elevated INR: The elevated INR is believed to be secondary to poor nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. The patient received 5 mg IV vitamin K in the ED, which normalized"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, presenting with profound dehydration, hypotension, and hypernatremia. She requires low-dose pressors overnight but is currently off them. The source of sepsis is unclear, and there is uncertainty about the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure measurements. The patient's behavior makes it difficult to place an arterial line. The plan is to refrain from using pressors and check lactates if mean arterial pressures decrease. Diuretics will be attempted today to address possible right ventricular distension contributing to diminished cardiac output and hypertension. The patient's sister-in-law and brother will meet with the healthcare team again today to discuss the patient's goals of care. The patient is off sotalol and coumadin and is being monitored for atrial fibrillation, with amiodarone used overnight to improve heart rates. Levophed is being weaned down, and the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) will be assessed for QTc interval. The patient has a femoral line, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) will be attempted with adjunctive lorazepam. The patient is receiving IV vitamin replacement and has a femoral line with plans for a PICC line due to her behavior. She is on prophylactic low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pantoprazole for stress"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, presenting with profound dehydration and hypotension. The patient required low-dose pressors overnight but was already off them today. There is no clear source of sepsis, and the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure readings is uncertain due to the patient's alertness and frequent yelling. The patient's behavior prohibits arterial line placement at this time. The medical team will attempt to refrain from using pressors and check lactates if mean arterial pressures decrease. They will also attempt diuresis today in case right ventricular distension is contributing to a diminished cardiac output or hypotension.

The patient has hypernatremia, which was resolved, failure to thrive, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently off sotalol and coumadin due to difficulty with oral intake. Amiodarone was used overnight to control rapid ventricular rates, and the patient's heart rate will be assessed as levophed is weaned down. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently elevated, and she has abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's access is currently through a femoral line, but due to her behavior, placing an internal jugular or subclavian line would be challenging, as she may pull it out. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line will be attempted with adjunctive lorazepam."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains intermittently pressor-dependent and
   with no PO intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated.  Was off pressors
   during day, but had mild hypotensio o/n and levophed put back on.
   Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause.
   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving WBC, afebrile
   state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP deferred for now
   given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Had negative CortStim
   test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.
   -- given negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2); discontinued  Zosyn on [**11-25**]
   and remained afebrile; WBC normalized
   -- Manual BP to ensure correlates with automatic read
   -- will trial lasix 20mg IV for diuresis to help reduce preload given
   severe MR
   -- wean levophed as tolerated
    #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient on sotalol and coumadin as outpatient.
   Currently in afib , on [**2140-11-26**], had  HR 110- 120
s, occ 130
s even while
   at rest
   --loading amiodarone IV x 9 days since1/3/09; cannot give oral at this
   time.
   -- Ongoing discussion with family re:  goals of care, and start hep gtt
   & coumadin for anticoagulation if plans for feeding tube; sotalol if
   ever able to give PO medications.
    #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavioral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.   Given family
s report of sharp
   decline 3-4 months ago, would also consider vascular dementia as
   contributing to (seemingly) abrupt decline.  Given question of acutely
   worsening dementia, checked vitamin B12 (was high); no known risk
   factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL, other  metabolic
   abnormalities were corrected.  Speech and swallow evaluation was
   completed (difficult to assess given patient
s lack of cooperation).
   Had fam htg with brother, [**Name (NI) 1384**], and his wife; he is still deciding
   overall goals of care and whether to provide a PEG tube for feeding.
   -- awaiting family decision on PEG tube broad goals of care
   --will need PICC for accesss; need to remove fem line
   -- Working up infectious etiology as above- negative w/u to date
   --thyroid studies normal
   -- Consider psychiatry/neurobehavoiral evaluation once further
   stabilized or as outpatient for further recommendations; might benefit
   from seeing Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1012**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in geriatrics who specializes in early
   onset AD r/t Down
   -- if family decides against PEG will consider palliative care c/s for
   possible hospice placement; in addition, will do social work consult.
   -- Cont MV
   -- Low dose haldol or ativan if needed for help with agitation; would
   give ativan 0.25 or 0.5 mg IV given prolonged effect of the 1 mg dose
   on [**2140-11-24**].
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect hypovolemic given history, exam, also not
   helped by patient continuing to take home dose of lasix.  Resolved with
   hydration,  Na normalized.
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR.
   -- Will discuss with family goals of care, will need to start heparin
   gtt if wish to continue aggressive treatment.
   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Acute renal failure:  resolved.  Likely prerenal; resolved with
   fluids.   UCx negative.  Still poor urine output
   -- trial of lasix to improve urine output
   #) Leukocytosis: resolved
   #) Seizure disorder: unable to take home meds depakote and trileptal
   b/c PO.
   -- Giving IV valproate while here in ICU; check level
   -- unable to take PO trileptal
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   -- cont levothyroxine 37.5 mg IV QD
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI IV as unable to take PO
    #) FEN: Sips as nursing feels comfortable, IVF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including Down syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She presented with failure to thrive, decreased oral intake, elevated lactate levels, hypernatremia, hypotension, and a supratherapeutic INR. The patient has been improving with intravenous fluids but remains intermittently dependent on vasopressors and unable to take oral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is still unclear. The patient was initially volume depleted but has been resuscitated. Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) was noted on cardiac echocardiogram, but the patient's cardiac function is normal. It is possible that severe MR is contributing to the hypotension, but other causes should also be considered. There is no evidence of sepsis or infection.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and is being treated with amiodarone IV. The patient's heart rate is controlled with sotalol and coumadin will be started for anticoagulation if plans for a feeding tube are pursued.

3. Failure to thrive/poor oral intake: The patient has a history of failure to thrive and poor oral intake, which appears to have acutely worsened. This may be due to behavioral components in the setting of possibly worsening Alzheimer"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving with IVF, though remains intermittently hypotensive during
   sleep and with no PO intake.
   #) Hypotension: Etiology still remains unclear.  Pt profoundly volume
   depleted on admission, though has been recuscitated.  Was off pressors
   during day, but had mild hypotensio o/n and levophed put back on.
   Cardiac echocardiogram showed severe MR, but function was normal,
   without pericardial effusion; severe MR could be contributing to
   hypotension, but again seems less likely that this is sole cause.
   There is no evidence of sepsis/infection with improving WBC, afebrile
   state, nothing localizing and no positive Cx data; LP deferred for now
   given MS appears to be at (recent) baseline.  Had negative CortStim
   test.  Thyroid studies were normal earlier this admission.  Given
   negative cx data (UCx, BCx x 2); discontinued  Zosyn on [**11-25**] and
   remained afebrile; WBC normalized.  Manual BP checked to ensure
   correlates with automatic read.
   -- will trial lasix 20mg IV for diuresis to help reduce preload given
   severe MR; keep MAP
s > 65
    #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient on sotalol and coumadin as outpatient.
    Earlier in week remained in afib , on [**2140-11-26**], had  HR 110- 120
s, occ
   130
s even while at rest.  Was loaded with amio IV with conversion to
   SR and HR < 100.
   --calculated amio dosing to go through [**2140-12-5**] (9 days since [**2140-11-26**]);
   cannot give oral at this time, but will convert to PO if she gets PEG
   tube
   -- per family who want to be aggressive with full care at this point,
   will consider restarting heparin with bridge to coumadin after PEG tube
    #) Failure to thrive/poor PO intake: Per OMR notes and office visit
   note detailing concerns of her care-givers, this has been an ongoing
   issue for months that appears to have acutely worsened. There appears
   to be at least some behavioral component in setting of possibly
   worsening Alzheimer's dementia.   Given family
s report of sharp
   decline 3-4 months ago, would also consider vascular dementia as
   contributing to (seemingly) abrupt decline.  Given question of acutely
   worsening dementia, checked vitamin B12 (was high); no known risk
   factors (not sexually active) for syphilis, TSH WNL, other  metabolic
   abnormalities were corrected.  Speech and swallow evaluation was
   completed (difficult to assess given patient
s lack of cooperation).
   Family has decided to go ahead with PEG.
   -- will call surgery RE PEG placement
   -- will discuss long-term placement options with CM
   -- Low dose haldol or ativan if needed for help with agitation; would
   give ativan 0.25 or 0.5 mg IV given prolonged effect of the 1 mg dose
   on [**2140-11-24**].
   -- will clarify recent medical hx with neurologist and PCP
   #) Elevated INR: INR in ED was [**8-4**], suspect again secondary to poor
   nutritional status and lack of vitamin K consumption. Patient received
   5 mg IV vitamin K in ED, with normalization of INR.
   -- per family who want to be aggressive with full care at this point,
   will consider restarting heparin with bridge to coumadin after PEG tube
   -- Continue SQH for PPX for now
   #) Acute renal failure:  resolved.  Likely prerenal; resolved with
   fluids.   UCx negative.  Still poor urine output.
   -- trial of lasix 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] IV to improve urine output
   #) Seizure disorder: unable to take home meds depakote and trileptal
   b/c PO.
   -- Giving IV valproate while here in ICU; check level
   -- unable to take PO trileptal
   #) Hypothyroidism: TSH/FT4 within normal limits. Continue home
   supplementation, but changing dose to IV ([**11-25**] of PO dose).
   -- cont levothyroxine 37.5 mg IV QD
   #) GERD: Continuing PPI IV as unable to take PO
    #) FEN: Sips as nursing feels comfortable, IVF.   Family would like
   PEG tube placed; awaiting surgery input.
   #) PPx: SQ heparin until decision made re: heparin gtt & coumadin;IV

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She presented with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate, hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR. The patient has been improving with IV fluids but remains intermittently hypotensive during sleep and with no PO intake.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is still unclear. She is profoundly volume depleted on admission, but has been resuscitated. The severe mitral regurgitation seen on cardiac echocardiogram could be contributing to the hypotension, but it seems less likely that this is the sole cause. There is no evidence of sepsis or infection, as the WBC count has been improving, the patient is afebrile, and there are no positive culture data. Thyroid studies were normal earlier in the admission, ruling out hypothyroidism as a cause. Considering the severe mitral regurgitation, it may be appropriate to trial Lasix 20 mg IV for diuresis to help reduce preload.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on sotalol and coumadin as an outpatient. Earlier in the week, she remained in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 110-120 bpm, occasionally reaching up to "

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease presenting with profound dehydration. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently off pressors, with improved urine output compared to yesterday. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 90/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has been on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation overnight with improved rates.

The patient has a history of dementia, allergies to oxycodone, and unknown allergies. She is currently receiving multiple medications including amiodarone, lorazepam, Trileptal, valproate, levothyroxine, Heparin SQ, protonix, and MVI. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some respiratory symptoms.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished but moaning. Her cardiovascular examination shows an irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur. Her respiratory system examination is clear bilaterally at the bases. Her extremities are 2+ bilaterally. Neurological examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease presenting with profound dehydration, hypotension, failure to thrive, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Dehydration: The patient is described as having profound dehydration. If not properly managed, dehydration can lead to electrolyte imbalances, organ dysfunction, and potentially life-threatening situations.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. If left untreated, hypotension can result in inadequate organ perfusion, leading to organ damage and failure.

3. Failure to thrive: The patient's failure to thrive suggests inadequate nutritional intake or absorption, which can lead to malnutrition and associated complications such as weakness, weight loss, impaired wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infections.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation, an irregular and often rapid heart rate. If not managed appropriately, atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other cardiac complications.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is hypothyroid, which means her thyroid gland is underactive. If not treated, hypothyroidism can lead to a range of symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and cognitive impairment.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's hydration status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for failure to thrive (FTT) and hypotension. Her medical workup has been negative, including imaging studies. The patient's neurologist has recommended a trial of antidepressant medication. The family has agreed to proceed with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient's current medications include amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, sotalol and warfarin for anticoagulation, valproate for mood stabilization, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and a proton pump inhibitor for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PEG placement complications: These may include bleeding, infection, perforation, or leakage at the site of the procedure.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains intermittently hypotensive during sleep and with no oral intake. This may be due to dehydration or ongoing fluid losses. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is essential to prevent further hypotension.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on amiodarone and warfarin. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and coagulation parameters is necessary to ensure effective anticoagulation and prevent thromboembolic events.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, presenting with profound dehydration and hypotension. She has been off pressors for 36 hours, and her urine output has improved compared to yesterday. The patient is also experiencing failure to thrive, likely due to dementia, and the family is requesting a G-tube placement. The patient's volume status is still grossly total volume overloaded, and she will be diuresed with a goal of -1L today if her blood pressure tolerates after the G-tube placement. She has atrial fibrillation and is currently off sotalol and coumadin as she is not taking oral medications. She is requiring amiodarone overnight with improved rates, and her QT interval is 432ms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dehydration: The patient is profoundly dehydrated, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, organ dysfunction, and shock.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can compromise tissue perfusion and lead to organ ischemia.
3. Failure to Thrive: The patient's failure to thrive indicates inadequate nutritional intake, which can result in weight loss, muscle wasting, and decreased immune function.
4. Total Volume Overload: The patient is grossly total volume overloaded, which can increase the risk of congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and renal dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease presenting with profound dehydration, hypotension, failure to thrive, and volume overload. She is currently in the ICU and is being managed for her various medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dehydration: The patient's profound dehydration needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires ongoing monitoring and management to ensure adequate perfusion and prevent shock.
3. Failure to thrive: The patient's failure to thrive, likely secondary to dementia, needs to be addressed through nutritional support such as tube feeding to prevent further weight loss and malnutrition.
4. Volume overload: The patient is grossly volume overloaded, which needs to be managed with diuretics to prevent fluid accumulation and associated complications like pulmonary edema.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with appropriate antiarrhythmic medications and close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which requires thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
7. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's inability to take oral medications may lead to gastrointestinal complications, and the placement of a G-tube will help in administering medications and providing nutritional support.
8. Infection risk: The patient's immunocompromised state due to advanced age"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 52-year-old female with Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism, was admitted with failure to thrive (FTT), decreased oral intake, elevated lactate levels, hypernatremia, hypotension, and a supratherapeutic INR. The patient has been improving with intravenous fluids (IVF) but remains intermittently hypotensive during sleep and unable to take oral medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient remains off pressors but experiences dipping of systolic blood pressure to 80s while sleeping. This may indicate ongoing issues with blood pressure regulation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on sotalol and coumadin as outpatient medication. Earlier in the week, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 110-120 beats per minute, occasionally reaching 130 beats per minute even at rest. The patient was loaded with amiodarone IV and converted to sotalol with heart rate below 100 beats per minute. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Seizure Disorder: There is a mention of a potential seizure disorder, but clarification with the neurologist revealed that depakote is for mood stabilization and not for seizure management. The patient is currently on IV valproate and will be converted back to home dose of"

Patient is a 52 year old female with Down's syndrome, Alzhemier
   dementia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism who presented with
   failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate,
   hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR.  Overall has been
   improving post-IVF, though remains intermittently hypotensive during
   sleep.  Had PEG placed [**11-30**] w/o complication.
   #) FTT: Had PEG placed [**11-30**] w/o complication.  Tube feeds started on
   [**2140-12-1**] per nutrition recs; at high risk for refeeding syndrome.
   -- monitor lytes closely; check chemistry-10 at 4 pm
   -- neurologist recommended trial of antidepressant as may have
   depression (in addition to dementia) been have been contributing to
   refusal to eat.  Started on Paxil on [**2140-11-30**].
   -- morphine PRN for pain control related to PEG (BP tolerated small
   doses morphine overnight)

s, occ
   130
s even while at rest.  Was loaded with amio IV with conversion to
   SR and HR < 100.  Changed to amio PO after placement of PEG on [**12-1**].
   Had an episode of RPR to 130-150
s w/o change in BP this morning (prior
   to am PO amio dose); tolerated metoprolol 5 mg IV w/o dropping BP with
   improvement of HR.
   -- cont amio 400 mg TID PO
   -- coumadin 1 mg PO QHS started on [**2140-11-30**]; not bridging with heparin.
   -- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 876**] plans to electrically cardiovert in [**2-27**] weeks once
   anticoagulated
   #) Hypotension: resolved; on home lasix; very edematous; SBP

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She presented with failure to thrive, decreased PO intake, elevated lactate, hypernatremia, hypotension, and supratherapeutic INR. The patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement without complications and started tube feeds per nutrition recommendations. She is at high risk for refeeding syndrome, so electrolytes will be closely monitored. The patient was also started on Paxil for possible depression contributing to refusal to eat. Morphine was given for pain control related to PEG placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refeeding syndrome: The patient is at high risk due to the initiation of tube feeds after prolonged fasting. Monitoring of electrolytes is essential to prevent this condition.

2. Thromboembolic events: The patient is on systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin due to atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of INR levels is necessary to prevent both thrombosis and bleeding complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient remains intermittently hypotensive during sleep. This requires close monitoring and adjustment of diuretic therapy as needed.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone. Ongoing monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary, and the patient is scheduled for electrical cardioversion in two"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease who is currently in the ICU. She presents with profound dehydration and hypotension, but urine output has improved compared to yesterday. The patient also has failure to thrive, likely due to dementia, and a G-tube has been placed. She is volume overloaded and will be diuresed with a goal of -1L today. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is currently off of sotalol and coumadin. She is experiencing some rapid ventricular response requiring amiodarone this morning, and her QT interval is 432ms. The plan is to continue amiodarone load via NGT today and administer coumadin via G-tube, aiming for an INR of [**12-27**]. The patient has multiple medical conditions including Down syndrome, presumed Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, and access issues with a PICC line in place. The rest of the plan is per resident note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dehydration: The patient's profound dehydration could lead to complications such as hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may result in inadequate organ perfusion and potentially lead to organ damage or dysfunction.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's gross total volume overload can increase the risk of pulmonary edema, acute heart failure, and"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with Down's Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease presenting with profound dehydration, hypotension, failure to thrive, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and presumed dementia. 

The patient underwent a PEG insertion for nutrition support and is currently receiving tube feeds. The plan is to monitor for refeeding syndrome through PM labs. The patient is also being diuresed with a goal of -1L today due to gross total volume overload. 

For atrial fibrillation management, the patient is currently off sotalol and coumadin as she is not taking PO's. She is experiencing some RVR and requires amiodarone this morning. The plan is to continue amiodarone load via NGT today and administer coumadin via G tube, targeting an INR of [**12-27**]. 

The patient's other conditions include Down Syndrome with presumed Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, and profound dehydration. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/51 mmHg to 109/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 4.7 to 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level ranging from "
