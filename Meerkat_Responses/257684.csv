","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with no major past medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital due to left-sided multifocal pneumonia not responsive to aggressive antibiotic regimen and difficulty weaning from ventilator. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, fever, labile blood pressure, tachycardia, mucocutaneous crusting, hypoalbuminemia, and other conditions. He is on multiple medications and interventions to manage his conditions and is currently on invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure and is on invasive ventilation. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not appropriately managed.

2. Infection: The patient has fever and mucocutaneous crusting, which raises concern for a possible infectious etiology, specifically HSV infection. Further investigation and management are necessary to control the infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient has labile blood pressure, which can indicate potential complications such as septic shock or other systemic inflammatory responses. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are required to maintain stable blood pressure.

4. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which can be a result of chronic inflammation or infection. It is important to identify the underlying cause and manage it accordingly to prevent further complications.

5. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of tachycardia, and although"

   .
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure.  .
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Initially, this was reasonably thought to be
   likely infectious.  He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for
   most community-acquired bacterial pathogens.  He also had repeated
   cultures from blood, sputum, and BAL fluid that were not revealing as
   to a pathogen.  At this point an infectious etiology seems less likely
   than an inflammatory process (possibly triggered by an infection?) such
   as COOP.
   Time course and acute onset suggests infectious etiology. Less likely
   inflammatory or vasculitic process, doubt malignancy (given acute
   onset, lack of malignancy on pathology). Nosocomial infections also
   possible given > 1 week hospitalization, although no sputum culture
   data to support MRSA or Pseudomonas involvement. Appearance on CXR not
   consistent with fluid overload at this point; recent echo (although
   sub-optimal) showed normal EF.
   - Repeat bronch/BAL in AM; send for viral (HSV, esp given mucocutaneous
   lesions) and fungal studies
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and
   levofloxacin for now
   - ARDSNet volumes at 6-7cc/kg (~400cc), try to minimize FiO2, keep on
   current PEEP of 12
   - Will speak to OSH in AM re: fungal (and other micro) stains of
   transbronchial biopsy specimen
   - Pan culture: sputum, urine, blood
   - Repeat echo now not tachycardic
   .
   #) Labile blood pressure:  It is unclear why he is hypotensive after
   having recently been quite hypertensive overnight.  The accompaniment
   of bradycardia is confusing, as he has not received his beta blocker
   He may have a systemic inflammatory response, although no positive
   blood cultures.  Cardiogenic is less likely given reportedly normal EF,
   absence of clinical signs of pulmonary or peripheral edema.  He has not
   received any steroids to put him at risk for adrenal insufficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He was transferred from another hospital and initially thought to have an infectious cause for his respiratory failure. However, repeated cultures from blood, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid have not revealed a pathogen. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSNet volumes at 6-7cc/kg and FiO2 at 40%. He has mucocutaneous crusting in the nares and lips, which raises concern for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, especially given the presence of mucocutaneous lesions. His blood pressure is labile, with episodes of hypotension and hypertension. The patient also has hypoalbuminemia, likely due to an ongoing infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there is an underlying infectious etiology or if the inflammatory process continues.
2. HSV Infection: The presence of mucocutaneous crusting and lesions raises concern for HSV infection, which could potentially lead to tracheal or bronchial involvement.
3. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure, with episodes of hypotension, needs to be closely monitored. Further evaluation is required to determine the cause of the hypotension.
4. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia should be"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   .
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure.  .
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Initially, this was reasonably thought to be
   likely infectious.  He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for
   most community-acquired bacterial pathogens.  He also had repeated
   cultures from blood, sputum, and BAL fluid that were not revealing as
   to a pathogen.  In any case, he would have completed a sufficient
   course for community-acquired pneumonia.  A viral or fungal etiology is
   also possible although perhaps less likely based on lack of
   immunocompromise as well as CXR appearance.  At this point an
   infectious etiology seems less likely than an inflammatory process
   (possibly triggered by an infection?) such as COOP.
   - stop antibiotics
   - repeat non-contrast chest CT today
   - consider steroids if chest CT suggests COOP or other
   steroid-responsive primary inflammatory discorder
   - decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain oxygenation
   .
   #) Hypotension:   He was hypotensive overnight after having been
   hypertensive yesterday.  Main differential is distributive vs
   cardiogenic, and the former is more likely given low CVP, recently
   normal EF at OSH, and absence of clinical signs of pulmonary or
   peripheral edema.  He has not received any steroids to put him at risk
   for adrenal insufficiency.  This possibly was secondary to sedation,
   although the episode was several hours after sedation was bolused for
   hypertension.  PEEP may also contribute, although not changed recently.
   - f/u SvO2
   - continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   - wean norepinephrine as tolerated, IVF boluses PRN to maintain MAP >65
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.
   - discuss with his family if he has a history of herpetic lesions
   - start empiric acyclovir
   - check DFA for HSV
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently bradycardic.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for this recently at OSH.  Digoxin level
   currently 1.
   -  continue metoprolol and digoxin with holding parameters
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin has fallen to 1.8 from 3.1 10 days ago.
   This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds (nutrition consult)
   - check urine for urinalysis
   .
   FEN:  tube feeds, replete lytes PRN
   .
   PPX:  heparin SC, bowel regimen, VAP bundle, H2 blocker

   #) F/E/N. No IVF for now, monitor/replete electrolytes. Tube feeds
   according to OSH (Replete with fiber at 70cc/hr). Will obtain nutrition
   consult.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.
- He was initially treated for suspected community-acquired bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics but did not show improvement.
- Repeated cultures from blood, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative for pathogens.
- The possibility of viral or fungal etiology is still considered, although less likely.
- The patient's respiratory failure is now thought to be due to a non-infectious inflammatory process, possibly COOP (community-acquired organizing pneumonia).
- Antibiotics have been stopped, and a repeat non-contrast chest CT is planned to assess for COOP.
- Steroids may be considered if the chest CT suggests COOP or other steroid-responsive primary inflammatory disorder.
- PEEP has been decreased as tolerated to maintain oxygenation.
- The patient experienced episodes of hypertension and hypotension, with the latter being more likely due to a distributive process rather than cardiogenic.
- Norepinephrine has been started to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65.
- Sedation boluses should be avoided, and IV fluid boluses will be given as needed to maintain MAP.
- The patient had mucocutaneous lesions, for which he was being treated empirically for herpes simplex virus (HSV) at the outside hospital"

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   .
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure.  .
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Initially, this was reasonably thought to be
   likely infectious.  He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for
   most community-acquired bacterial pathogens.  He also had repeated
   cultures from blood, sputum, and BAL fluid that were not revealing as
   to a pathogen.  In any case, he would have completed a sufficient
   course for community-acquired pneumonia.  A viral or fungal etiology is
   also possible although perhaps less likely based on lack of
   immunocompromise as well as CXR appearance.  At this point an
   infectious etiology seems less likely than an inflammatory process
   (possibly triggered by an infection?) such as COOP.
   - stop antibiotics
   - repeat non-contrast chest CT today
   - consider steroids if chest CT suggests COOP or other
   steroid-responsive primary inflammatory discorder
   - decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain oxygenation
   .
   #) Hypotension:   He was hypotensive overnight after having been
   hypertensive yesterday.  Main differential is distributive vs
   cardiogenic, and the former is more likely given low CVP, recently
   normal EF at OSH, and absence of clinical signs of pulmonary or
   peripheral edema.  He has not received any steroids to put him at risk
   for adrenal insufficiency.  This possibly was secondary to sedation,
   although the episode was several hours after sedation was bolused for
   hypertension.  PEEP may also contribute, although not changed recently.
   - f/u SvO2
   - continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   - wean norepinephrine as tolerated, IVF boluses PRN to maintain MAP >65
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.
   - discuss with his family if he has a history of herpetic lesions
   - start empiric acyclovir
   - check DFA for HSV
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently bradycardic.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for this recently at OSH.  Digoxin level
   currently 1.
   -  continue metoprolol and digoxin with holding parameters
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin has fallen to 1.8 from 3.1 10 days ago.
   This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds (nutrition consult)
   - check urine for urinalysis
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history.
- He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be likely infectious.
- He was treated with appropriate antibiotics but repeated cultures did not reveal a pathogen.
- The respiratory failure is now believed to be due to an inflammatory process, possibly triggered by an infection.
- Other issues include hypotension, mucocutaneous lesions, history of tachycardia, and hypoalbuminemia.
- The patient is on various medications and treatments, including sedation, ventilation, and prophylactic measures.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is ICU pending improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be due to an infection. However, it is now believed to be caused by an inflammatory process such as COOP (Complex Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The patient requires continued respiratory support and monitoring.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which is likely due to a distributive process rather than cardiogenic. The patient's low central venous pressure (CVP), recent normal ejection fraction (EF), and absence of pulmonary or peripheral edema support this assessment. The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored and managed with IV fluids and vasopressor therapy as needed.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure.  .
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Initially, this was reasonably thought to be
   likely infectious.  He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for
   most community-acquired bacterial pathogens.  He also had repeated
   cultures from blood, sputum, and BAL fluid that were not revealing as
   to a pathogen.  In any case, he would have completed a sufficient
   course for community-acquired pneumonia.  A viral or fungal etiology is
   also possible although perhaps less likely based on lack of
   immunocompromise as well as CXR appearance.  At this point an
   infectious etiology seems less likely than an inflammatory process
   (possibly triggered by an infection?) such as COOP.
   - stop antibiotics
   - repeat non-contrast chest CT today
   - consider steroids if chest CT suggests COOP or other
   steroid-responsive primary inflammatory discorder
   - decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain oxygenation
   .
   #) Hypotension:   No longer
   He was hypotensive overnight after having been hypertensive yesterday.
   Main differential is distributive vs cardiogenic, and the former is
   more likely given low CVP, recently normal EF at OSH, and absence of
   clinical signs of pulmonary or peripheral edema.  He has not received
   any steroids to put him at risk for adrenal insufficiency.  This
   possibly was secondary to sedation, although the episode was several
   hours after sedation was bolused for hypertension.  PEEP may also
   contribute, although not changed recently.
   - f/u SvO2
   - continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   - wean norepinephrine as tolerated, IVF boluses PRN to maintain MAP >65
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.
   - discuss with his family if he has a history of herpetic lesions
   - start empiric acyclovir
   - check DFA for HSV
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently bradycardic.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for this recently at OSH.  Digoxin level
   currently 1.
   -  continue metoprolol and digoxin with holding parameters
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin has fallen to 1.8 from 3.1 10 days ago.
   This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds (nutrition consult)
   - check urine for urinalysis

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

- The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure.
- He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis (likely due to gallstone pancreatitis), cholelithiasis, and thrombocytopenia.
- The initial treatment for respiratory failure included antibiotics for community-acquired bacterial pathogens, but no specific pathogen was identified.
- It is now believed that an infectious etiology seems less likely, and an inflammatory process such as COOP (consolidation outside of pneumonia) may be present.
- The patient's hypotension was initially thought to be secondary to sedation, but other possible causes such as distributive or cardiogenic shock are being considered.
- Mucocutaneous lesions were treated empirically for HSV with topical acyclovir.
- The patient's history of tachycardia is currently being managed with metoprolol and digoxin.
- Hypoalbuminemia is likely due to a systemic inflammatory process.
- The patient is receiving tube feeds and has ongoing management for other conditions including thrombocytopenia and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if there is an underlying infectious or inflammatory process that is not adequately addressed"

   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure,
   currently of unclear etiology.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  He was intubated at OSH and transferred for
   failure to improve from presumed infectious PNA.  We have been
   considering infectious vs inflammatory causes.  CT yesterday appeared
   improved compared to images obtained from OSH, did not show clear
   evidence of COP.  Work-up for infectious causes has been thus far
   negative, but he has received a full course of antibiotics
   (ceftriaxone, levoflox, gent, doxycycline), but a resistent or atypical
   organism remains a possibilitly.  Currently he likely has an element of
   volume overload as well.  Regarding his ventilator status, he continues
   to have very low lung compliance and A-a gradient >100.  Currently he
   also has a respiratory alkalosis .
   - no antibiotics for now
   - repeat BAL today for gram stain and culture including nocardia
   - consider steroids for empiric treatment of an inflammatory condition
   - decrease PSV to improve respiratory alkalosis
   - 20 mg IV lasix now and goal net negative 500 cc today
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.
   - continue empiric acyclovir
   - check DFA for HSV
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.8, decreased from 3.1 10
   days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has protein in his urine, with an
   protein/creatinine ratio of  .9.   This is unlikely to be substantial
   enough to have caused the acute drop in his serum albumin.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  This is not nephrotic range, with protein/creatinine
   of .9.  He has a normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  That urinalysis also
   showed mild pyuria.
   - f/u urine culture
   - re-check UA
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hypotension:   No further episodes of hypotension.  Cause may have
   been related to sedation.
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently normal rate.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for tachycardia recently at OSH.
   -  continue metoprolol and digoxin with holding parameters

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure,
   currently of unclear etiology.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Although the cause remains unknown, he seems
   to be improving based on fever curve and serial images (both CT and
   CXR).  Perhaps he had a very bad pneumonia that was effectively treated
   but is taking time to resolve.  No cultures have been positive, and
   this is not clearly an inflammatory pneumonia based on CT.  Broncoscopy
   yesterday was unrevealing.
   - no antibiotics
   - wean vent as tolerated:  currently on PSV, will turn down pressure
   support and PEEP, do a spontaneous breathing trial this afternoon, get
   a RSBI
   - lighten sedation and move toward extubation in the morning
   - goal net even
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function given possible component of volume
   overload today
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.  DFA yesterday negative for HSV, culture
   pending.
   - continue empiric acyclovir
   -
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.
   - f/u urine culture
   - re-check UA and re-send urinary protein
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hyponatremia:  mild, likely secondary to free water boluses in TF
   - stop free water boluses
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hypotension:   No further episodes of hypotension.  Cause may have
   been related to sedation.
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently normal rate.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for tachycardia recently at OSH.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure. The cause of his respiratory failure remains unclear, but there are indications of improvement. He has mucocutaneous lesions that were initially treated empirically for herpes simplex virus (HSV), but a DFA test was negative for HSV. 

The patient also has hypoalbuminemia, which is likely secondary to a systemic inflammatory process and malnutrition. His proteinuria is being monitored, and he has mild hyponatremia, which is believed to be due to free water boluses. There is no further evidence of hypotension, and his tachycardia seems to have resolved. 

The patient's current plan includes weaning off ventilator support as tolerated, with a goal of extubation in the morning. An echo will be done to evaluate cardiac function due to possible volume overload. Empiric acyclovir will continue for the mucocutaneous lesions, and nutrition will be continued with tube feeds. The patient's electrolytes will be monitored and repleted as needed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include pneumonia, respiratory failure, fever, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, hyponatremia, hypotension, and tachycardia."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure,
   currently of unclear etiology.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  He was intubated at OSH and transferred for
   failure to improve from presumed infectious PNA.  We have been
   considering infectious vs inflammatory causes.  CT yesterday appeared
   improved compared to images obtained from OSH, did not show clear
   evidence of COP.  Work-up for infectious causes has been thus far
   negative, but he has received a full course of antibiotics
   (ceftriaxone, levoflox, gent, doxycycline), but a resistent or atypical
   organism remains a possibilitly.  Currently he likely has an element of
   volume overload as well.  Regarding his ventilator status, he continues
   to have very low lung compliance and A-a gradient >100.  Currently he
   also has a respiratory alkalosis .
   - no antibiotics for now
   - repeat BAL today for gram stain and culture including nocardia
   - consider steroids for empiric treatment of an inflammatory condition
   - decrease PSV to improve respiratory alkalosis
   - 20 mg IV lasix now and goal net negative 500 cc today
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.
   - continue empiric acyclovir
   - check DFA for HSV
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.8, decreased from 3.1 10
   days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has protein in his urine, with an
   protein/creatinine ratio of  .9.   This is unlikely to be substantial
   enough to have caused the acute drop in his serum albumin.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  This is not nephrotic range, with protein/creatinine
   of .9.  He has a normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  That urinalysis also
   showed mild pyuria.
   - f/u urine culture
   - re-check UA
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hypotension:   No further episodes of hypotension.  Cause may have
   been related to sedation.
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently normal rate.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for tachycardia recently at OSH.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure,
   currently of unclear etiology.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Unclear cause, but seems to be improving.
   Broncoscopy unrevealing, no evidence of infection.  Episode of hypoxia
   this morning may have been related to need for suctioning. RSBI
   indicative that he can not be extubated today.  Echo yesterday
   basically normal, likely not a big component of volume overload.
   - no antibiotics
   - wean vent as tolerated, although likely not ready for extubation yet
   - goal net even
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   - continue empiric acyclovir
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures are no growth to
   date.
   - consider involving renal
   .
   #) Eosinophiliuria:  he has eosinophils in his urine.
   - check peripheral eosinophils
   - review medication list for possible causes
   .
   #) Hyponatremia:  mild, free water in TF stopped yesterday
   - urine osms
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hypotension:   No further episodes of hypotension.  Cause may have
   been related to sedation.
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently normal rate.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for tachycardia recently at OSH.   This were
   discontinued yesterday and he has not been tachycardic again.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with no significant medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient has been intubated but is awake, with general appearance showing an endotracheal tube in place. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/49 mmHg to 181/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 438 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 40 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) at 92%.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure,
   currently of unclear etiology.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Unclear cause, but seems to be improving.
   Broncoscopy unrevealing, no evidence of infection.  Episode of hypoxia
   this morning may have been related to need for suctioning. RSBI
   indicative that he can not be extubated today.  Echo yesterday
   basically normal, likely not a big component of volume overload.
   - no antibiotics
   - wean vent as tolerated, although likely not ready for extubation yet
   - goal net even
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   - continue empiric acyclovir
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures are no growth to
   date.
   - consider involving renal
   .
   #) Eosinophiliuria:  he has eosinophils in his urine.
   - check peripheral eosinophils
   - review medication list for possible causes
   .
   #) Hyponatremia:  mild, free water in TF stopped yesterday
   - urine osms
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hypotension:   No further episodes of hypotension.  Cause may have
   been related to sedation.
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently normal rate.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for tachycardia recently at OSH.   This were
   discontinued yesterday and he has not been tachycardic again.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure of unclear etiology.
- He has been intubated but remains awake, with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, endotracheal tube, and OG tube in place.
- Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular heart rhythm without murmurs, and anterior crackles are heard more on the left side.
- Abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present.
- Neurologic examination indicates that the patient responds to voice, tracks with eyes, but does not follow commands.
- Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and albumin levels. Urine analysis reveals albuminuria, moderate eosinophils, and no signs of infection.
- Echocardiogram results are generally normal, with no significant heart valve abnormalities or systolic dysfunction.
- The patient has mucocutaneous ulceration, pneumonia of unclear cause, respiratory failure (improving), fever (hypothermia), hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, eosinophiliuria, hyponatremia, hypotension, and a history of tachycardia.
- Treatment plans include weaning from CPAP to PSV, continuing"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but seems to be improving. An echocardiogram showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, and there is no evidence of infection based on bronchoscopy results.

The patient has mucocutaneous lesions that were initially treated empirically for herpes simplex virus (HSV), but DFA testing was negative for HSV. Cultures are pending. The patient also has hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process and malnutrition. There is significant proteinuria, but no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The patient's eosinophils in urine and peripheral eosinophilia should be further evaluated.

Other issues include hyponatremia, which may be related to free water administration, and hypotension, which could be attributed to sedation. The patient's history of tachycardia has resolved after discontinuing metoprolol and digoxin.

Plan:

1. Continue empiric acyclovir for mucocutaneous lesions.
2. Wean vent as tolerated, but not ready for extubation yet.
3. Discuss tracheostomy with family.
4. Continue nutrition with tube feeds.
5. Check peripheral eosinophils and review medication list for possible causes of"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure,
   currently of unclear etiology.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Unclear cause, but seems to be improving.
   Broncoscopy unrevealing, no evidence of infection.  Episode of hypoxia
   this morning may have been related to need for suctioning. RSBI
   indicative that he can not be extubated today.
   - no antibiotics
   - wean vent as tolerated, although likely not ready for extubation yet
   - goal net even
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function given possible component of volume
   overload today
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   - continue empiric acyclovir
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures are no growth to
   date.
   - consider involving renal
   .
   #) Eosinophiliuria:  he has eosinophils in his urine.
   - check peripheral eosinophils
   - review medication list for possible causes
   .
   #) Hyponatremia:  mild, free water in TF stopped yesterday
   - stop free water boluses
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hypotension:   No further episodes of hypotension.  Cause may have
   been related to sedation.
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible
   .
   #) History of tachycardia:  Currently normal rate.  He was started on
   metoprolol and digoxin for tachycardia recently at OSH.   This were
   discontinued yesterday and he has not been tachycardic again.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history.
- He was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure of unclear etiology.
- The patient is currently intubated but awake, with regular heart rhythm and no murmurs.
- He has anterior crackles in the lungs, mucocutaneous ulceration, and proteinuria.
- His laboratory results show hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, and eosinophiluria.
- The patient has been treated empirically for HSV, with DFA negative for HSV and culture pending.
- He has been weaned from CPAP to [**9-30**] and suctioned.
- His RSBI is 156, and PaO2 is 70, which was increased FiO2 to 50%.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 117/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a net output of 301 mL over the past 24 hours.
- The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a Vt of 438 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 19, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 156.
- The patient's physical examination reveals warm skin with mucocutaneous crusting in the nares and lips, and he responds to voice but does not follow commands.
- The patient's medical history includes tachycardia, for which he was started on metoprolol and digoxin, but these were discontinued yesterday.
- The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.
- The patient has received various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and acyclovir.
- The patient's discharge disposition is ICU pending improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, and the cause is unclear. This condition can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Mucocutaneous Lesions: The patient has mucocutaneous ulceration, which could be due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Continued treatment with acyclovir is necessary until the culture results are available.
3. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin level is low, indicating a possible systemic inflammatory process and malnutrition. Close monitoring and continued nutrition support with tube feeds are essential.
4. Proteinuria: The patient has significant protein in his urine, which may be related to kidney issues or a pulmonary-renal syndrome. Further evaluation and consideration of involving renal services are necessary.
5. Eosinophiliuria: The patient has eosinophils"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure
   secondary to PNA overlying COPD.
   #) Respiratory failure: Broncoscopy unrevealing, no evidence of current
   infection
no Abx. Do not believe that this is COP
no steroids.  Current
   lung findings likely the consequence of impaired ability to clear
   treated PNA b/c of severe underlying emphysema.   Failed PSV.  Echo
   basically normal, likely not a big component of volume overload.
   - pursuing trach/peg, discussed with family who is in agreement, IP
   will call regarding timing: tues v wed.
   - no antibiotics or steroids
   - will consider repeat trials to wean, but pt failed PSV markedly
   - goal net even
   - sputium growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum

   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Lower suspicion for Zoster given b/l lesions.
   - derm has been emailed images, need to f/u on their impression
   - continue acyclovir 400mg tid
   .
   #) Delirium:  Multiple reasons for delirium including shortness of
   breath/hypoxia as well as prolonged ICU course and critical illness.
   - AC ventilation for rest
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not
   nephrotic range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds

   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - recheck
   .
   #) Eosinophiliuria:  he has eosinophils in his urine.  He also has a
   rash on his back.  New meds include famotidine and acyclovir.
   Peripheral eosinophils not significvantly elevated.  Ueos could also be
   related to significant yeast in urine, rash on back is more prominent
   in axilla  and groin c/w fungal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who is admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia overlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's current lung findings are likely due to an impaired ability to clear treated pneumonia because of severe underlying emphysema. The patient has failed noninvasive ventilation (PSV) and is being considered for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia overlying COPD. The underlying emphysema impairs his ability to clear the treated pneumonia, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Mucocutaneous Lesions: The patient has mucocutaneous lesions, but DFA negative for HSV, and culture pending. Lower suspicion for Zoster given bilateral lesions.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be caused by shortness of breath/hypoxia, prolonged ICU course, and critical illness.
4. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process and malnutrition.
5. Proteinuria: The patient has proteinuria, which is significant despite changing Foley catheter. Cultures growing only yeast.

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure
   secondary to PNA overlying COPD.
   #) Respiratory failure: Broncoscopy unrevealing, no evidence of current
   infection
no Abx. Do not believe that this is COP
no steroids.  Current
   lung findings likely the consequence of impaired ability to clear
   treated PNA b/c of severe underlying emphysema.   Failed PSV.  Echo
   basically normal, likely not a big component of volume overload.
   - pursuing trach/peg, discussed with family who is in agreement, IP
   will call regarding timing: tues v wed.
   - no antibiotics or steroids
   - will consider repeat trials to wean, but pt failed PSV markedly
   - goal net even
   - sputium growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Lower suspicion for Zoster given b/l lesions.
   - derm has been emailed images, need to f/u on their impression
   - continue acyclovir 400mg tid
   .
   #) Delirium:  Multiple reasons for delirium including shortness of
   breath/hypoxia as well as prolonged ICU course and critical illness.
   - AC ventilation for rest
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not
   nephrotic range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - recheck
   .
   #) Eosinophiliuria:  he has eosinophils in his urine.  He also has a
   rash on his back.  New meds include famotidine and acyclovir.
   Peripheral eosinophils not significvantly elevated.  Ueos could also be
   related to significant yeast in urine, rash on back is more prominent
   in axilla  and groin c/w fungal.
   - change foley
   - replace famotidine with sucralfate
   .
   #) Hyponatremia:  mild, free water in TF stopped yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with no significant medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia overlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has failed noninvasive ventilation (PSV) and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is no evidence of current infection, and bronchoscopic findings were unrevealing. The lung findings are likely a consequence of impaired ability to clear treated pneumonia due to severe underlying emphysema.

2. Mucocutaneous lesions: The patient has oral mucocutaneous ulceration, and DFA negative for HSV. Culture pending. Lower suspicion for Zoster given bilateral lesions. Continue acyclovir 400mg tid.

3. Delirium: Multiple reasons for delirium including shortness of breath/hypoxia as well as prolonged ICU course and critical illness. AC ventilation for rest.

4. Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1 10 days ago. This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process and malnutrition. He also has significant albuminuria, but not nephrotic range. Continue nutrition with tube feeds.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure
   secondary to PNA overlying COPD.
   #) Respiratory failure:  Not ready to wean yet.  Broncoscopy
   unrevealing, no evidence of infection. Likely has bad pneumonia on top
   of baseline emphysema.   RSBI and current status indicative that he can
   not be extubated today.  Echo yesterday basically normal, likely not a
   big component of volume overload.
   - discuss with family the possibility of trach
   - no antibiotics
   - wean vent as tolerated, although likely not ready for extubation yet
   - goal net even
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  He was being treated empirically for HSV at
   OSH with topical acyclovir.  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Low suspicion for Zoster given b/l lesions.
   - will send pictures to dermatology consultant for review
   - continue empiric acyclovir
   .
   #) Delirium:  Multiple reasons for delirium including shortness of
   breath/hypoxia as well as prolonged ICU course and critical illness.
   - AC ventilation for rest
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures are no growth to
   date.
   - discuss with renal
   .
   #) Eosinophiliuria:  he has eosinophils in his urine.  He also has a
   rash on his back.  New meds include famotidine and acyclovir.
   - check peripheral eosinophils
   - stop famotidine

   #) Hypotension:   No further episodes of hypotension.  Cause may have
   been related to sedation.
   - avoid sedation boluses if possible

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who is admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia overlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, eosinophilia, hyponatremia, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has mucocutaneous lesions that are being treated empirically for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still not ready to be weaned off mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia on top of baseline emphysema. Bronchoscopy was unrevealing, with no evidence of infection.
2. Mucocutaneous Lesions: The patient has mucocutaneous lesions, which are being treated empirically for HSV infection. DFA negative for HSV, and culture is pending.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, possibly due to hypoxia, prolonged ICU stay, and critical illness.
4. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process and malnutrition. Albumin levels have decreased from 3.1 to 1.9 in the past 10 days.
5. Proteinuria: The patient has significant proteinuria, but with normal creatinine levels and no evidence of glomer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's condition has been unstable, with increased oxygen requirements and loss of central line and arterial line. There have been discussions about tracheostomy with the family. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on sedation with midazolam. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with pneumonia, which has led to respiratory failure. The cause of pneumonia is unclear.
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD, which is contributing to the respiratory failure.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, indicating hyponatremia.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, not associated with ARDS. This is likely due to the combination of pneumonia and COPD.
5. Fever: The patient has had intermittent fevers, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
6. Prostatic Hypertrophy: The patient has benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).
7. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk for malnutrition due to poor oral intake.
9. Risk for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT.
10. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness.
11. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Please note that the above summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure
   secondary to PNA overlying COPD.
   #) Respiratory failure: Initial bronchoscopy unrevealing, no evidence
   of current infection
no Abx. Do not believe that this is COP
   steroids.  Current lung findings likely the consequence of impaired
   ability to clear treated PNA b/c of severe underlying emphysema.
   Failed PSV on Saturday, this has been basis of decision to pursue
   trach/peg.  Echo basically normal, likely not a big component of volume
   overload. CXR demonstrating some interval worsening; this coincides
   with new tan colored sputum.
   - pursuing trach/peg, discussed with family who is in agreement, IP
   will call regarding timing: tues v wed.
   - no antibiotics or steroids currently, but will obtain second opinion
   from another chest radiologist on whether appearance on CT could be
   atypical presentation for COP.
   - REPEAT SPUTUM
   - goal net even
   - sputium growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Lower suspicion for Zoster given b/l lesions.
   - derm has been emailed images, need to f/u on their impression
   - continue acyclovir 400mg tid for total of 10d course
   .
   #) Diffuse drug rash: initially thought to be fungal given dependent
   distribution and confluence in axilla/groin, but currently seems to be
   more c/w drug rash. Multiple possible offenders: initial Abx which he
   has been off of for 4 days, famotidine which wwas discontinued,
   possibly acyclovir
?  No blood eosinpjilia; previously with U eos. U
   eos could also be [**1-28**] yeast UTI.
   - monitor skin for areas of necrosis, otherwise expectant mgt
   - repeat U eos.
   #) Hyponatremia: Start off by restricting flushes and other sources of
   free water. Send ULTYES,OSMS, serum osms; continue to trend.
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not
   nephrotic range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - recheck

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia overlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including fungal infection, unclear cause pneumonia, hyponatremia, oral mucocutaneous ulceration, urine eosinophilia, respiratory failure, fever, benign prostatic hypertrophy, delirium/confusion, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia overlying COPD. This could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in ventilator dependence or failure.
2. Fungal Infection: The patient has a fungal infection that requires prompt treatment to prevent further spread and complications.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as seizures or neurological damage.
4. Oral Mucocutaneous Ulceration: The presence of oral ulcers may indicate a systemic infection or other underlying condition that needs to be evaluated and treated appropriately.
5. Urine Eosinophilia: Elevated levels of eosinophils in the urine may suggest an allergic reaction or interstitial nephritis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and manage it accordingly.
6. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status needs to be addressed, and appropriate measures should be"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure
   secondary to PNA overlying COPD.
   #) Respiratory failure: Broncoscopy unrevealing, no evidence of current
   infection
no Abx. Do not believe that this is COP
no steroids.  Current
   lung findings likely the consequence of impaired ability to clear
   treated PNA b/c of severe underlying emphysema.   Failed PSV.  Echo
   basically normal, likely not a big component of volume overload.
   - pursuing trach/peg, discussed with family who is in agreement, IP
   will call regarding timing: tues v wed.
   - no antibiotics or steroids
   - will consider repeat trials to wean, but pt failed PSV markedly
   - goal net even
   - sputium growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Lower suspicion for Zoster given b/l lesions.
   - derm has been emailed images, need to f/u on their impression
   - continue acyclovir 400mg tid
   .
   #) Delirium:  Multiple reasons for delirium including shortness of
   breath/hypoxia as well as prolonged ICU course and critical illness.
   - AC ventilation for rest
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not
   nephrotic range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - recheck
   .
   #) Eosinophiliuria:  he has eosinophils in his urine.  He also has a
   rash on his back.  New meds include famotidine and acyclovir.
   Peripheral eosinophils not significvantly elevated.  Ueos could also be
   related to significant yeast in urine, rash on back is more prominent
   in axilla  and groin c/w fungal.
   - change foley
   - replace famotidine with sucralfate
   .
   #) Hyponatremia:  mild, free water in TF stopped yesterday
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prostatic hypertrophy, and delirium. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, fever, and hypotension. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. 

Medical Complications:

1. Fungal rash vs drug rash: The patient has developed a spreading rash on his torso, which could be due to a fungal infection or a drug allergy. Further assessment is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can lead to neurological complications. Correcting the sodium imbalance is crucial to prevent further issues.

4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is essential.

5. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can complicate his clinical course. Managing his agitation and ensuring adequate sedation and pain control are necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Regular assessment of his respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure
   secondary to PNA overlying COPD.
   #) Respiratory failure: BAL and bronch without clear cuase of
   multilobular inflammation, no evidence of infection, off abx since
   [**5-24**].  Unclear if COP, holding on tx with steroids. [**Month (only) 8**] be slowly
   clearing PNA  in setting of underlying emphysema.   Failed PSV on [**5-25**],
   therefore, preparing for trach.  Echo WNL. CXR demonstrating some
   improvement with increased recruitment.
   - trach to be placed today [**5-28**]
   - hold on further antibiotics or steroids currently
   - goal net even
   - sputium growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum
   - increase PEEP to 10 from 8
   - follow daily cxr
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Unlikely Zoster given b/l lesions. On day 7 of acylovir
   - consider d/c of acylovir due to rash, completed 7 day tx
   .
   #) Diffuse drug rash: initially thought to be fungal given, but now
   appears allergic. Multiple possible drug offenders: initial Abx which
   he has been off since [**5-23**], famotidine which wwas discontinued,
   possibly acyclovir or fentayl, no eosinophilia on diff; previously with
   urine eos.
   - monitor skin for areas of necrosis,
   - if awakes, may need bendryl
   - will d/c acylovir and fentanyl
   #) Hyponatremia: Apears to be SIADH, likely from lung process.
   - will monitor NA [**Hospital1 **], restict fluids if needed
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin [**5-26**] was 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   earlier in month.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory
   process and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not
   nephrotic range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - monitor renal function

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who is admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia (PNA) overlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has mucocutaneous lesions, diffuse drug rash, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is intubated and sedated. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Urine culture is pending, and sputum culture shows sparse yeast. The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure due to PNA overlying COPD. This can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Mucocutaneous lesions: The patient has mucocutaneous lesions with negative DFA for HSV and pending culture. These lesions may indicate an ongoing infection or allergic reaction, which needs to be closely monitored.
3. Diffuse drug rash: The patient has a diffuse drug rash that initially appeared to be fungal but is now thought to be allergic. It is important to identify the offending drug and discontinue it to prevent further allergic reactions.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely secondary"

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure
   secondary to PNA overlying COPD.
   #) Respiratory failure: Initial bronchoscopy unrevealing, no evidence
   of current infection
no Abx. Do not believe that this is COP
   steroids.  Current lung findings likely the consequence of impaired
   ability to clear treated PNA b/c of severe underlying emphysema.
   Failed PSV on Saturday, this has been basis of decision to pursue
   trach/peg.  Echo basically normal, likely not a big component of volume
   overload. CXR demonstrating some interval worsening; this coincides
   with new tan colored sputum.
   - pursuing trach/peg, discussed with family who is in agreement, IP
   will call regarding timing: tues v wed.
   - no antibiotics or steroids currently, but will obtain second opinion
   from another chest radiologist on whether appearance on CT could be
   atypical presentation for COP.
   - REPEAT SPUTUM
   - goal net even
   - sputium growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Lower suspicion for Zoster given b/l lesions.
   - derm has been emailed images, need to f/u on their impression
   - continue acyclovir 400mg tid for total of 10d course
   .
   #) Diffuse drug rash: initially thought to be fungal given dependent
   distribution and confluence in axilla/groin, but currently seems to be
   more c/w drug rash. Multiple possible offenders: initial Abx which he
   has been off of for 4 days, famotidine which wwas discontinued,
   possibly acyclovir
?  No blood eosinpjilia; previously with U eos. U
   eos could also be [**1-28**] yeast UTI.
   - monitor skin for areas of necrosis, otherwise expectant mgt
   - repeat U eos.
   #) Hyponatremia: Start off by restricting flushes and other sources of
   free water. Send ULTYES,OSMS, serum osms; continue to trend.
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin is stable at 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   10 days ago.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process
   and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not
   nephrotic range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - recheck

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU and underwent percutaneous tracheostomy. The patient has been experiencing fever, mucocutaneous lesions (which turned out to be an allergic drug rash), hyponatremia (likely due to SIADH), hypoalbuminemia (possibly secondary to systemic inflammatory process and malnutrition), and proteinuria (with no evidence of glomerulonephritis).

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure was due to pneumonia. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory distress can occur if not properly managed.
2. Mucocutaneous lesions: Although initially thought to be fungal or due to herpes simplex virus (HSV), it was later determined to be an allergic drug rash. Monitoring for areas of necrosis and discontinuing potential offending medications are important to prevent further complications.
3. Hyponatremia: This is likely due to SIADH, which can lead to complications like seizures or neurological dysfunction if not managed appropriately.
4. Hypoalbuminemia: It is secondary to systemic inflammatory process and malnutrition. If not addressed, it may lead to complications like edema or poor wound healing.

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6672**] is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history who
   is transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory failure
   secondary to PNA overlying COPD.
   #) Respiratory failure: BAL and bronch without clear cuase of
   multilobular inflammation, no evidence of infection, off abx since
   [**5-24**].  Unclear if COP, holding on tx with steroids. [**Month (only) 8**] be slowly
   clearing PNA  in setting of underlying emphysema.   Failed PSV on [**5-25**],
   therefore, preparing for trach.  Echo WNL. CXR demonstrating some
   improvement with increased recruitment.
   - trach to be placed today [**5-28**]
   - hold on further antibiotics or steroids currently
   - goal net even
   - sputium growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum
   - increase PEEP to 10 from 8
   - follow daily cxr
   .
   #) Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Unlikely Zoster given b/l lesions. On day 7 of acylovir
   - consider d/c of acylovir due to rash, completed 7 day tx
   .
   #) Diffuse drug rash: initially thought to be fungal given, but now
   appears allergic. Multiple possible drug offenders: initial Abx which
   he has been off since [**5-23**], famotidine which wwas discontinued,
   possibly acyclovir or fentayl, no eosinophilia on diff; previously with
   urine eos.
   - monitor skin for areas of necrosis,
   - if awakes, may need bendryl
   - will d/c acylovir and fentanyl
   #) Hyponatremia: Apears to be SIADH, likely from lung process.
   - will monitor NA [**Hospital1 **], restict fluids if needed
   .
   #) Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin [**5-26**] was 1.9 today, decreased from 3.1
   earlier in month.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory
   process and malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not
   nephrotic range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   .
   #) Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of
   glomerulonephritis that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal
   syndrome.  There is no history of diabetes.  Significant protein in
   urine on repeat despite changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - monitor renal function

","Summary:
- The patient is a 77-year-old man with no significant medical history.
- He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia (PNA) overlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- He has undergone a percutaneous tracheostomy, and his tracheostomy tube is currently set to deliver 400 mL of ventilation support.
- The patient's sodium levels are low (128), indicating hyponatremia, which is likely due to a lung process like SIADH.
- He has hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to systemic inflammation and malnutrition.
- The patient also has proteinuria but no evidence of glomerulonephritis.
- He has been on various medications, including acyclovir, fentanyl, heparin, midazolam, and morphine sulfate.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to PNA overlying COPD. Although his condition seems to be improving with increased recruitment on the chest X-ray, there is still a risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. Drug Rash: The patient developed a diffuse drug rash, initially thought to be fungal"

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The patient was transferred from another hospital and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has anasarca, warm skin, and a diffuse erythematous rash on the abdomen and extremities. The patient also has edema in the arms and legs. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's blood glucose level is 107 mg/dL, hemoglobin is 8.4 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8.5 K/uL, platelet count is 320 K/uL, creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL, and sodium is 128 mEq/L.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count. The patient's urine culture on 5/27 was negative, and the sputum culture on 5/27 was also negative. The patient's blood cultures have not shown any growth.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, fever, mucocutaneous lesions, diffuse drug rash, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, hematuria, and anemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is expected to require long-term acute care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), nosocomial infections, pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. 

Further workup and management should include daily chest X-rays to monitor for VAP, increasing PEEP to 10 from 8, repeating sputum and urine cultures, monitoring fluid balance and electrolytes, continuing nutrition support, and monitoring renal function."

   COPD. Off abx since [**5-24**].  Failed PSV on [**5-25**], s/p trach on [**2143-5-28**].
   - possible small subsegmental PE, but unclear on CT scan, was not a CTA
   protocol scan
   ----- hold off on anticoagulation
   ----- f/u final CT Chest read
   ----- LE Doppler U/S for DVT evaluation
   - possible infection - LUL PNA w effusions, no fevers
   ----- hold off on antibiotics
   ----- sputum growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum
   ----- blood cx pending, so far negative
   ----- thoracentesis for cx today
   - possible COP, and underlying COPD
   ----- hold off on steroids
   - continue mechanical ventilation, now with less PEEP
   - follow daily cxr
   - monitor cxs
   - goal net negative
   # Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Unlikely Zoster given b/l lesions. Completed acyclovir 7 day course
   -can remove zoster precautions
   .
   # Diffuse drug rash: initially thought to be fungal, but then appeared
   to be allergic. Multiple possible drug offenders: initial Abx which he
   has been off since [**5-23**], famotidine which was discontinued, possibly
   acyclovir or fentayl, no eosinophilia on diff; previously with urine
   eos. Resolved.
   - monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Apears to be SIADH, likely from lung process.
   - will monitor Na
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin [**5-26**] was 2.1, decreased from 3.1 earlier in
   month.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process and
   malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not nephrotic
   range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds, plan for PEG possible today based
   on CT scan
   - repeat albumin and LFTs
   .
   # Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of glomerulonephritis
   that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal syndrome.  There is no
   history of diabetes.  Significant protein in urine on repeat despite
   changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - monitor renal function
   - repeat urine pro/Cr
   # Hematuria: Unclear etiology, may be from foley trauma
   - recheck UA
   # Anemia: Normocytic, baseline Hct ~31. Unclear etiology, but likely
   2/2 blood loss from hematuria and procedures (trach?) in the setting of
   anemia of chronic disease. Low 20s now.
   - monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for Hct < 21

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure from pneumonia (PNA). The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, with differential diagnoses including cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), infection, or pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been off antibiotics since May 24th and failed pressure support ventilation (PSV) on May 25th. He underwent tracheostomy on May 28th. The patient's current conditions include possible small subsegmental PE, but the CT scan results are not conclusive, so anticoagulation has been held off. There is also a possibility of infection, specifically left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA) with effusions, but without fever. Antibiotics have been held off as well. The patient's sputum culture is growing only yeast, so Nystatin has been prescribed. Blood cultures are pending, and a thoracentesis for pleural effusion will be done today. The patient's past medical history includes mucocutaneous lesions, diffuse drug rash, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, hematuria, and anemia. His current goals of care include full code status, plan for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and long-term acute care (LTAC) facility placement. ICU care involves tube feeds, monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of COPD and recent transfer from an outside hospital for respiratory failure due to pneumonia. He has been intubated and mechanically ventilated since 5/28. The patient's current condition includes respiratory alkalosis, mild hematuria, anasarca with diffuse edema, and a macular diffuse rash on the abdomen and extremities. His vital signs show hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, and anemia. The patient has been off antibiotics since 5/24 and has sputum growing only yeast. The assessment and plan include ongoing mechanical ventilation, monitoring for mucocutaneous lesions, managing hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, and hematuria, as well as continuing nutrition support and considering a PEG and LTAC facility placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, and he remains on mechanical ventilation. There is an unclear etiology for his respiratory failure, with differential diagnoses including Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP), infection, or other causes. Monitoring daily chest X-rays and cultures will help guide further management.

2. Mucocutaneous Lesions: The patient has mucocutaneous lesions that are DFA negative for HSV and culture pending. Initially thought to be"

   COPD. Off abx since [**5-24**].  Failed PSV on [**5-25**], s/p trach on [**2143-5-28**].
   - ? small subsegmental PE
   ----- hold off on anticoagulation
   ----- f/u final CT Chest read
   ----- consider LE Doppler U/S for DVT evaluation
   - ? infection - LUL PNA w effusions, no fevers
   ----- hold off on antibiotics
   ----- sputium growing only yeast
 Nystatin S+S, rpt sputum
   - ? COP/COPD
   ----- hold off on steroids
   - continue mechanical ventilation  (Pressure Control)
   - follow daily cxr

   # Mucocutaneous lesions:  DFA negative for HSV, culture pending.
   Unlikely Zoster given b/l lesions. Completed acyclovir 7 day course
   .
   # Diffuse drug rash: initially thought to be fungal, but then appeared
   to be allergic. Multiple possible drug offenders: initial Abx which he
   has been off since [**5-23**], famotidine which was discontinued, possibly
   acyclovir or fentayl, no eosinophilia on diff; previously with urine
   eos. Improving on [**5-30**].
   - monitor skin for areas of necrosis,
   # Hyponatremia: Apears to be SIADH, likely from lung process.
   - will monitor Na [**Hospital1 **], restrict fluids if needed
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Albumin [**5-26**] was 1.9, decreased from 3.1 earlier in
   month.  This is likely secondary to systemic inflammatory process and
   malnutrition.  He also has significant albuminuria, but not nephrotic
   range.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds
   - repeat albumin and LFTs
   .
   # Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of glomerulonephritis
   that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal syndrome.  There is no
   history of diabetes.  Significant protein in urine on repeat despite
   changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast.
   - monitor renal function
   - repeat urine pro/Cr
   # Hematuria: Unclear etiology, may be from foley trauma

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation. The patient has been on various medications including propofol, midazolam, and morphine sulfate. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/47 mmHg. The patient has been intubated and sedated, withdrawing extremities to pain. He has anasarca, diffuse rash on the abdomen and extremities, and edema in the arms and legs. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia. The WBC count is slightly elevated. Imaging studies reveal left upper lobe pneumonia, bilateral effusions, and possible subsegmental pulmonary embolism. The abdominal CT scan is non-diagnostic due to motion abnormality. 

The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, mucocutaneous lesions, diffuse drug rash, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, hematuria, anemia, and goals of care. The patient is planned for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and long-term acute care facility placement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further deterioration of respiratory function.
2. Thromboembolic events such as deep"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia (PNA). He was transferred from another hospital and has a history of baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has been off antibiotics since May 24th and underwent a tracheostomy on May 28th. His respiratory status has worsened due to anxiety. A chest CT scan on May 30th showed multifocal PNA with effusions, mostly on the left side. There are no clinical signs of active infection, so he is not currently on antibiotics. Blood cultures are pending, but so far they are negative. A thoracentesis was considered but the pleural effusion is not large enough according to the intensivist. There is a possibility of small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE), but it is unclear on the CT scan and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was not performed. Lower extremity ultrasound (LE U/S) was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Anticoagulation has been held off, as well as a CTA for PE evaluation due to low suspicion. There is also a possibility of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) and underlying COPD. Steroids have been held off for now. The patient's anxiety has been treated with increased olanzapine and lorazepam. He is now on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to pneumonia. He was transferred from the operating room for respiratory failure and has been intubated and sedated. The patient has anasarca, a condition characterized by generalized edema. His chest X-ray shows moderately enlarged effusions compared to a previous CT scan, and Doppler leg ultrasounds ruled out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's Hct improved from 23.1 to 26.0. His blood cultures are pending, and he has been off antibiotics since May 24th. The patient's sputum is growing only yeast, so Nystatin is being started. A thoracentesis for culture is planned today. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a tracheostomy tube, and his ABG shows a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 213. The patient's other lab results include leukopenia, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has several potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, possible small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE), infection, COPD, and mucocutaneous lesions. The patient's goals of care remain full code with plans for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and long-term acute care facility placement."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA). He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/59 mmHg to 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32-37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but he has hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia. His renal function is impaired, as indicated by proteinuria and an elevated BUN and creatinine. There is also evidence of hematuria, which may be due to Foley catheter trauma. The patient's anemia is normocytic, and he has a rash that is likely drug-related. The goals of care include full code status, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and transfer to a long-term acute care facility. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and the current respiratory failure pose a risk for continued difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of effusions and low-grade temperatures suggests possible ongoing infection, which may require further intervention.
3. Hypoalbuminemia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure from likely pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital and has been intubated and sedated. The patient's current condition shows improvement in some areas, such as a higher hematocrit level of 26 and resolution of the rash. However, there are still several concerns and potential complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still on ventilation support with CPAP, and the goal is to wean him off as tolerated. Daily chest X-rays will be monitored to assess his oxygenation and progress.

2. Infection: Although the patient is off antibiotics since May 24th, there is a possibility of multifocal pneumonia with effusions (larger on the left side). Sputum culture showed yeast and sparse Gram-negative rods, while blood cultures are pending. A thoracentesis may be considered to obtain cultures from the effusion.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CT scan was not a contrast-enhanced CT angiogram (CTA), it showed possible small subsegmental PE. However, the Doppler lower extremities were negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and anticoagulation has been held off.

4. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP): The patient's underlying COPD may also be a factor contributing to his respiratory failure."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia (PNA). The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was transferred from the emergency department and underwent intubation on 5/28. The patient's respiratory status has worsened due to anxiety, and there are concerns about possible infection, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), or pulmonary embolism (PE). Imaging shows multifocal pneumonia with effusions, but no clear evidence of PE. The patient's sputum culture revealed yeast and sparse gram-negative rods (non-Pseudomonas), and blood cultures are pending. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia despite being on CPAP. Daily chest x-rays will be followed, and a tracheostomy collar trial will be conducted today.
2. Possible infection: The patient may have an active infection, as indicated by fever and leukocytosis. If temperature exceeds 100.4°F or if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) will be started.
3. Possible small subsegmental PE: There is a suspicion of pulmonary embolism, but the CT scan does not confirm it. A lower extremity ultrasound is negative for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient underwent a tracheostomy on 5/28 and has been on mechanical ventilation since then. He also has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition. The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.6 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mEq/L, and elevated lactate levels at 1.1 mmol/L. The patient's renal function is within normal limits. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but his urine culture shows the presence of nitrites and bacteria, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's proteinuria is significant, and he has anemia with a hematocrit level of around 26%. His albumin levels are low, and he is hypoalbuminemic. The patient's rash is likely due to an allergic reaction to chlorhexidine prep used during the PEG placement. His mucocutaneous lesions are negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and culture pending. The patient's goals of care include full code and plans for long-term acute care facility placement."

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure from likely pneumonia, now with intermittent low fevers. He has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia with effusions, possibly secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient has also shown signs of anxiety and is being treated with olanzapine and lorazepam. There is a suspicion of a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE), but further investigation is needed. The patient's underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and possible cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) are also being considered. 

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing urinary tract infections (UTIs) likely caused by yeast, as indicated by the improvement of the urinary analysis (UA) after changing the Foley catheter. Cultures are growing only yeast, and the patient's protein/Cr ratio is improving. 

The patient's anemia is normocytic and may be due to blood loss from hematuria and procedures, as well as anemia of chronic disease. His hypoalbuminemia appears to have resolved. 

There are various rashes present, including bullous abdominal lesions likely caused by an allergic reaction to chlorhexidine prep during the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The mucocutaneous lesions are negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and culture pending, while the diffuse torso/LE rash is likely due to a drug reaction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure from likely pneumonia, now presenting with intermittent low fevers. The patient has been transferred from another hospital and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a tracheostomy, is mechanically ventilated, and has multiple lines. The patient's past medical history includes COPD and anxiety. The patient's current medications include lorazepam, haloperidol, lasix, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for low-grade fevers. The patient's physical examination reveals edematous skin, labial lesions, and ronchi present bilaterally. The patient's assessment includes possible infection (HAP), respiratory failure (likely pneumonia in the setting of COPD), anxiety, possible small subsegmental PE, possible COP, and underlying COPD. The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for HAP, monitoring daily chest X-rays, holding off on anticoagulation or CTA chest,"

   ----- continue lorazepam 1mg PO BID
   - possible small subsegmental PE, but unclear on CT scan, was not a CTA
   protocol scan, LE U/S negative for DVT, low suspicion at this point.
   Holding off on anticoagulation or CTA Chest.
   - possible COP, and underlying COPD, holding off on steroids
   - ventilation support now w CPAP, wean as tolerated
   - follow daily cxr
   - goal net negative to help oxygenation
   # ? UTI: UA [**5-31**] shows +nitr, trace LE, 74 WBC, few bacteria, no fevers,
   but some low grade-temps. U Cx w yeast in the past.
   - add on urine cx
   - change foley and recheck  UA/UCx
   # Hematuria: Unclear etiology, may be from foley trauma, improved.
   - monitor for now
   # Proteinuria:  Normal creatinine and no evidence of glomerulonephritis
   that would make us think of a pulmonary-renal syndrome.  There is no
   history of diabetes.  Significant protein in urine on repeat despite
   changing Foley.  Cultures growing only yeast. Improving protein/Cr
   ratio

   - monitor renal function
   # Anemia: Normocytic, baseline Hct ~31. Unclear etiology, but likely
   2/2 blood loss from hematuria and procedures (trach/PEG) in the setting
   of anemia of chronic disease.  Stable ~26.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - transfuse for Hct < 21
   # Hypoalbuminemia: [**1-28**] malnutrition/proteinuria in the setting of
   systemic inflammatory process.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds w transition to PEG
   - monitor albumin
   # Hyponatremia: Appears to be SIADH, likely from lung process.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to likely pneumonia. The patient has intermittent low-grade fevers, and there is a suspicion of infection. The patient underwent a tracheostomy on [**2143-5-28**] and is currently on CPAP ventilation support. The patient's respiratory failure is unclear in etiology, but it is believed to be caused by pneumonia in the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), worsened by anxiety. The patient has a history of COPD and was off antibiotics since [**5-24**]. A CT scan on [**5-30**] revealed multifocal pneumonia with effusions. The patient also has a possible small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE), but this is unclear on the CT scan, and there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on leg ultrasound. 

The patient has shown signs of possible urinary tract infection (UTI), with a urine analysis showing nitrates, trace leukocytes, 74 white blood cells (WBC), and few bacteria. The patient's urinalysis also showed yeast in the past. There is also a concern for hematuria, which may be due to Foley catheter trauma, and proteinuria, which is improving. The patient's renal function is being monitored, and there are no signs of glomerulonephritis or pulmonary-"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to likely pneumonia. The patient has a history of COPD and was transferred from another hospital. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, initially suspected to be hospital-acquired (HAP). The sputum culture revealed a non-fermenter bacterium, which is resistant to the current antibiotics being administered. This suggests that the pneumonia may not be responding well to treatment, increasing the risk of complications.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation support, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's chest X-ray shows multifocal pneumonia with effusions, indicating the possibility of VAP.

3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing intermittent low fevers and has been showing disorientation and agitation. This could be indicative of delirium, which is common in critically ill patients, especially those with pneumonia.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a baseline Hct of approximately 31%. The anemia is likely due to blood loss from procedures and underlying chronic disease. Close monitoring of the patient's Hct levels and transfusion if necessary is crucial.

5. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which may be secondary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia (PNA). The patient also has intermittent low fevers and has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia with effusions, as seen on the CT scan. 

The patient has been started on vancomycin (Vanc), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The initial blood cultures were negative, so a thoracentesis for culture was considered but not performed due to the lack of a large enough effusion.

The patient also has possible small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE), but this suspicion is low, and anticoagulation or computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been held off. The patient's left upper extremity ultrasound (LE U/S) was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Additionally, the patient has possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), underlying lung pathology, and anxiety, which worsened his respiratory failure. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) and PE were considered but are now less likely.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) likely caused by yeast, as indicated by the urine analysis (UA) showing improvement after Foley catheter change. Cultures growing only yeast suggest a yeast infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia (PNA). The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently experiencing intermittent low fevers.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 149/71 mmHg to 161/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as decreased hematocrit and albumin levels. The patient's blood cultures are negative so far. 

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Sputum cultures have grown non-fermenter bacteria and yeast. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of COPD, and the etiology is unclear. There is a possibility of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) or pulmonary embolism (PE), but the suspicion is low. 

The patient has also been experiencing possible urinary tract infection (UT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of COPD, transferred from another hospital for respiratory failure. The patient has intermittent low fevers, likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and an allergic reaction to chlorhexidine. The patient developed superficial bullae surrounding the peg site, PICC site, and oral region, which are areas treated with chlorhexidine. The patient's urine culture only grows yeast, and the WBC diff demonstrated eosinophils at 14%. Eosinophilia, superficial bullae, and fevers are felt to be secondary to ongoing chlorhexidine wash. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia in the setting of COPD, worsened by anxiety. The patient had a tracheostomy on [2143-5-28] and has non-fermenter bacteria in sputum with likely secondary PNA. The patient is being discharged to a long-term acute care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has intermittent low fevers, and there is a possibility of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Allergic reaction to chlorhexidine: The patient developed superficial bullae at the sites where chlorhexidine was applied, indicating a potential allergic reaction to this medication.
3. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which may be related to malnutrition or proteinuria in"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and intermittent low fevers. The patient was transferred from another hospital for respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia (PNA), now with intermittent low fevers. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which may have contributed to his respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status (not delirium), constipation, rash, hyponatremia (low sodium), fever, prostatic hypertrophy (benign), delirium/confusion, respiratory failure (acute), pneumonia (healthcare-associated pneumonia or HAP), and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
- Heart rate: 99 bpm (normal range: 75-105 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 145/57 mmHg (normal range: 98/51-163/80 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 38 breaths per minute (normal range: 20-38 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 94% on tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

The patient's laboratory results show the following abnormalities:
- White blood cell count: 8.3 (normal range: 7.9-10.7)
- Hematocrit"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of COPD, transferred from another hospital for respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia (PNA). He has been treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. The patient has intermittent low fevers and his sputum culture shows non-fermenter bacteria and yeast. He is on CPAP/PSV ventilation support and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD, worsened by anxiety and possible secondary PNA, could lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Infection (HAP): The patient's sputum culture shows non-fermenter bacteria and yeast, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is already on a combination of antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) for this.
3. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which may be delirium, possibly due to multiple factors such as infection, medications, or underlying COPD.
4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation and is being treated with a bowel management regimen.
5. Rash: The patient has a rash, likely an allergic reaction to chlorhexidine prep during PEG placement.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatrem"

   77M w [**Hospital 6812**] transferred from OSH for respiratory failure from likely
   PNA, now w intermittent low fevers.
   # Fever: Likely from VAP and allergic reaction to chlorhexidine (see
   below). Sputum with GNR- non-fermenter, and yeast.
   Urine culture only grows yeast.
   - treat with vanc/levo for HAP for 8 day course
# Allergic reaction:  Patient developed superficial bullae surrounding
peg site, picc site and oral region - all areas treated with
chlorhexidine. In addition WBC diff demonstrated eosinophils
14%. Eosinophilia, superficial bullae and fevers all felt to be
secondary to ongoing chlorhexidine wash.
   - chlorhexidine added to allergy list.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: On presentation likely pneumonia in the setting
   of COPD, worsened by anxiety. DDx also includes Cryptogenic Organizing
   PNA (COP) vs PE (but low suspicion). Off abx since [**5-24**], restarted [**6-2**]
   once fevers reoccured.  S/p trach on [**2143-5-28**]. Worsened by anxiety. Now
   has non-fermenter bacteria in sputum with likely secondary PNA (see
   above).
   - infection (HAP)
 see treatment above
   - anxiety
 well controlled with celexa and haldol
   - pt to be discharged to LTAC
   # Anemia: Normocytic, baseline Hct ~31. Unclear etiology, but likely
   2/2 blood loss from hematuria and procedures (trach/PEG) in the setting
   of anemia of chronic disease.  Stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - transfuse for Hct < 21
   # Hypoalbuminemia: [**1-28**] malnutrition/proteinuria in the setting of
   systemic inflammatory process.
   - continue nutrition with tube feeds via PEG
   - monitor albumin
   # Hyponatremia: Stable. Appears to be SIADH, likely from lung process.
   - monitor daily lytes
   # Goals of Care: discharge today to LTAC (long-term acute care)

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure from likely pneumonia, now with intermittent low fevers.
- The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, constipation, rash, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyponatremia, prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), delirium, and respiratory failure.
- The patient developed an allergic reaction to chlorhexidine, resulting in superficial bullae around the peg site, PICC site, and oral region.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia in the setting of COPD, worsened by anxiety.
- The patient has non-fermenter bacteria in the sputum with likely secondary pneumonia.
- The patient's anemia is normocytic and baseline Hct is around 31, unclear etiology but likely due to blood loss from hematuria and procedures.
- The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which may be caused by malnutrition/proteinuria in the setting of a systemic inflammatory process.
- The patient's hyponatremia appears to be SIADH, likely from the lung process.
- The patient's goals of care include discharge to a long-term acute care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The combination of emphysema and pneumonia may"
