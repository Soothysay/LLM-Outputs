   24 Hour Events:
   Patient's Hct decreased to 33 from 35 despite getting 3 units of PRBCs.
   Additionally, SBP dropped transiently to  80s and he passed a large,
   frankly bloody BM. He was given one more unit of PRBCs and IR and GI
   were notified. Per that discussion, patient was taken for tagged RBC
   scan, where bleeding was found in the sigmoid colon. While undergoing
   bleeding scan, patient's BP continued to intermittently drop and he
   received a total of 2 more units of blood and 3 liters of NS with
   transient increases in BP, but continued hematochezia. He was then
   brought up to the ICU for placement of a cordis and received 6 more
   units of PRBCs, 2 bags of FFP, 1 bag of platelets and 4 liters of NS.
   The plan was for IR intervention once he became hemodynamically stable,
   but patient was then noted to suddenly develop acute abdominal pain,
   abdominal distention and high pitched bowel sounds, which were
   concerning for a perforation. Surgery was notified and came to examine
   the patient, but he refused examination, stating that he only wanted to
   be made comfortable. He continued to refuse surgery at this point and
   had previously been made DNR/DNI. KUB was deferred as was angiographic
   intervention, at the patient's request. He was given Morphine boluses
   for comfort and the family was notified so that they could be present
   with him.  He was made CMO.

   Assessment and Plan
   # GIB: Confirmed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. Patient is no longer
   amenable to angiography and was never agreeable to surgery and these
   are essentially the extent of his definitive treatment options. Patient
   required several PRBCs and IVF and though currently hemodynamically
   stable, thought to be due to temporary halt of bleeding, he is at risk
   for further bleeding. Per repeated conversation with patient, he is
   only interested in being made comfortable with no further intervention.
   Additionally, his respiratory status is tenuous s/p multiple PRBCs and
   IVF boluses, so additional resuscitation would likely result in
   pulmonary edema, which would require Lasix and this would only
   potentiate hypotension.
   - Comfort measures only; no labs, avoid blood products and IVF,
   Morphine PRN for abdominal pain
   - Appreciate IR, GI and surgical input thus far

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 35% to 33% despite receiving 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). This indicates ongoing bleeding. The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) also dropped transiently to the 80s, and they passed a large, frankly bloody bowel movement. 

The patient was given additional PRBCs and intravenous fluids (IVF) and underwent a tagged red blood cell scan, which revealed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. The patient continued to experience intermittent drops in blood pressure while undergoing the bleeding scan and received a total of 2 more units of blood and 3 liters of normal saline (NS).

Subsequently, the patient was brought to the ICU for the placement of a cordis and received 6 more units of PRBCs, 2 bags of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 bag of platelets, and 4 liters of NS.

The patient presented with a chief complaint of a large, bloody bowel movement (BM) and subsequently experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) despite receiving three units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) also dropped transiently to the 80s. A tagged red blood cell scan revealed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. The patient received a total of six units of PRBCs, two bags of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), one bag of platelets, and four liters of normal saline (NS). The patient's condition remained unstable, and surgery was notified. However, the patient refused examination and intervention, stating a preference for comfort care. The patient had previously been made do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI). The family was notified, and the patient received morphine boluses for comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's SBP dropped transiently to the 80s, indicating potential cardiovascular compromise. This could be due to significant blood loss from the bleeding sigmoid colon.
2. Acute abdomen: The patient suddenly developed acute abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and high-pitched bowel sounds, which are concerning for perforation. This could indicate a potential surgical emergency.

   # GIB: Confirmed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. Patient is no longer
   amenable to angiography and was never agreeable to surgery and these
   are essentially the extent of his definitive treatment options. Patient
   required several PRBCs and IVF and though currently hemodynamically
   stable, thought to be due to temporary halt of bleeding, he is at risk
   for further bleeding. Per repeated conversation with patient, he is
   only interested in being made comfortable with no further intervention.
   Additionally, his respiratory status is tenuous s/p multiple PRBCs and
   IVF boluses, so additional resuscitation would likely result in
   pulmonary edema, which would require Lasix and this would only
   potentiate hypotension.
   - Comfort measures only; no labs, avoid blood products and IVF,
   Morphine PRN for abdominal pain
   - Appreciate IR, GI and surgical input thus far
   - Discontinue unnecessary meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting in hemodynamic instability. Despite receiving blood transfusions, the patient's blood hemoglobin concentration continued to decrease. A tagged red blood cell scan identified the source of bleeding in the sigmoid colon. The patient's condition remained unstable, with intermittent hypotension and ongoing bleeding. After receiving multiple units of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets, the patient's vital signs stabilized temporarily. However, due to the patient's refusal of further intervention, including surgery or angiography, the bleeding continued. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning due to the recent blood transfusions. The patient's wishes are to focus on comfort measures only, without any additional resuscitation or intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has already experienced significant bleeding and continues to refuse interventions that could potentially stop the bleeding.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and additional resuscitation efforts may lead to pulmonary edema, particularly due to fluid overload from blood transfusions.
3. Infection: The patient is immunocompromised due to the ongoing bleeding and blood transfusions, increasing the risk of infection.
4. Organ failure: The patient's kidneys may be at risk due to decreased perfusion caused by hypotension and ongoing blood loss. Liver and heart function could also be compromised.
5. Hypothermia: Due to the blood loss"

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient's Hct decreased to 33 from 35 despite getting 3 units of PRBCs.
   Additionally, SBP dropped transiently to  80s and he passed a large,
   frankly bloody BM. He was given one more unit of PRBCs and IR and GI
   were notified. Per that discussion, patient was taken for tagged RBC
   scan, where bleeding was found in the sigmoid colon. While undergoing
   bleeding scan, patient's BP continued to intermittently drop and he
   received a total of 2 more units of blood and 3 liters of NS with
   transient increases in BP, but continued hematochezia. He was then
   brought up to the ICU for placement of a cordis and received 6 more
   units of PRBCs, 2 bags of FFP, 1 bag of platelets and 4 liters of NS.
   The plan was for IR intervention once he became hemodynamically stable,
   but patient was then noted to suddenly develop acute abdominal pain,
   abdominal distention and high pitched bowel sounds, which were
   concerning for a perforation. Surgery was notified and came to examine
   the patient, but he refused examination, stating that he only wanted to
   be made comfortable. He continued to refuse surgery at this point and
   had previously been made DNR/DNI. KUB was deferred as was angiographic
   intervention, at the patient's request. He was given Morphine boluses
   for comfort and the family was notified so that they could be present
   with him.  He was made CMO.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's hematocrit (Hct) decreased to 33 from 35 despite receiving three units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Additionally, the patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) dropped transiently to the 80s and he passed a large, frankly bloody bowel movement (BM). One more unit of PRBCs and intravenous fluids (IVF) were given, and the patient was taken for a tagged red blood cell scan, which revealed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. 

The patient continued to experience intermittent drops in blood pressure and received a total of two more units of blood and three liters of normal saline (NS) with transient increases in blood pressure. However, the patient continued to have hematochezia (bloody stools). 

Afterward, the patient was brought to the ICU for placement of a cordis and received six more units of PRBCs, two bags of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), one bag of platelets, and four liters of NS. The plan was to perform interventional radiology (IR) once the patient became hemodynamically stable. However, the patient suddenly developed acute abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and high-pitched bowel sounds, which were concerning for perforation. Surgery was notified but the patient refused examination, stating that he only wanted to be made comfortable. 

The patient had previously been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) and deferred keyhole examination (KUB) as well as angiographic intervention at the patient's request. Morphine boluses were given for comfort, and the family was notified so that they could be present with the patient. The patient was made comfort measures only (CMO). 

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, but no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius (98.5 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 99 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 113/61 mmHg to 154/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on morphine sulfate and other ICU medications. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 35.4 g/dL, platelet count of 199 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose of 107 mg/dL. Other lab values are provided in the note. 

The patient's assessment and plan include confirmed gastrointestinal bleeding with bleeding in the sigmoid colon, no further intervention desired by the patient, comfort measures only, avoidance of blood products and IVF, and morphine PRN for abdominal pain. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI/CMO. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, pulmonary edema, and electrolyte imbalances."

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a medical history of colon cancer status post hemicolectomy, multiple small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), diverticulitis, and coronary artery disease status post left anterior descending artery stent. He was admitted with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and a likely sigmoid colon source. The patient received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to massive bleeding following a tagged red blood cell scan. Subsequently, he experienced severe abdominal pain and declined further interventions, including angiography and surgery. The patient is currently do not resuscitate/do not intubate/comfort measures only (DNR/DNI/CMO) and is receiving morphine for pain management.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a medical history of colon cancer, hemicolectomy, multiple small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), diverticulitis, and coronary artery disease (CAD) with a left anterior descending artery (LAD) stent. He was admitted with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and likely had a sigmoid colon bleed. The patient received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to massive bleeding. He then experienced severe abdominal pain and declined further interventions, including angiography and surgery. The patient is now do not resuscitate/do not intubate/comfort measures only (DNR/DNI/CMO) and is receiving morphine for abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid colon perforation: The patient's severe abdominal pain following massive bleeding suggests the possibility of a perforation in the sigmoid colon.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, and his heart rate is elevated, indicating hemodynamic instability.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen saturation is below normal, which may indicate respiratory distress or difficulty in breathing.
4. Kidney injury: The elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) suggest potential kidney injury.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count indicates thrombocytopenia, which could be due to massive blood transf"

   Assessment and Plan
   # GIB: Confirmed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. Patient is no longer
   amenable to angiography and was never agreeable to surgery and these
   are essentially the extent of his definitive treatment options. Patient
   required several PRBCs and IVF and though currently hemodynamically
   stable, thought to be due to temporary halt of bleeding, he is at risk
   for further bleeding. Per repeated conversation with patient, he is
   only interested in being made comfortable with no further intervention.
   Additionally, his respiratory status is tenuous s/p multiple PRBCs and
   IVF boluses, so additional resuscitation would likely result in
   pulmonary edema, which would require Lasix and this would only
   potentiate hypotension.
   - Comfort measures only; no labs, avoid blood products and IVF,
   Morphine PRN for abdominal pain
   - Appreciate IR, GI and surgical input thus far
   - Discontinue unnecessary meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with confirmed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. The patient is no longer amenable to angiography and has declined surgery. The treatment options are limited to comfort measures only, with no further intervention. The patient's respiratory status is tenuous due to multiple packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions and intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses, which may result in pulmonary edema if additional resuscitation is attempted.

The patient's vital signs show stable hemodynamics with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/52 to 125/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.1 degrees Celsius.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 11.5 to 19.8 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin concentration ranging from 30.8 to 46.0 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 112 to 199 thousand cells per microliter, creatinine level ranging from 0.9 to 1.2 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 74 to 120 mg/dL.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,466 mL, including 582 mL of oral intake, 360 mL of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of colon cancer and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who presented to the ICU with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient initially had signs of bowel perfusion but is now recovering well with conservative management. The patient's condition has improved, and there is no evidence of active bleeding or bowel perforation. He is tolerating oral intake and has been restarted on oral medications. The patient's allergies, review of systems, and vital signs are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Despite the initial improvement, there is a risk of re-bleeding due to the patient's history of AVMs and ongoing hematochezia.
2. Infection: The patient has received a massive transfusion, which increases the risk of infection, particularly if there was microperforation of the bowel. The administration of antibiotics is appropriate in this case.
3. Metastasis of colon cancer: The patient's CT scan showed worsening mesenteric lymphadenopathy and matting, concerning for metastasis of his prior malignancy. Long-term management of colon cancer needs to be discussed with the patient's gastroenterologist.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating a potential risk of hypotension, especially during periods of active bleeding or if there is ongoing blood loss.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance"

   Assessment and Plan
   # GIB: Confirmed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. Patient is no longer
   amenable to angiography and was never agreeable to surgery and these
   are essentially the extent of his definitive treatment options. Patient
   required several PRBCs and IVF and though currently hemodynamically
   stable, thought to be due to temporary halt of bleeding, he is at risk
   for further bleeding. Per repeated conversation with patient, he is
   only interested in being made comfortable with no further intervention.
   Additionally, his respiratory status is tenuous s/p multiple PRBCs and
   IVF boluses, so additional resuscitation would likely result in
   pulmonary edema, which would require Lasix and this would only
   potentiate hypotension.
   - Comfort measures only; no labs, avoid blood products and IVF,
   Morphine PRN for abdominal pain
   - Appreciate IR, GI and surgical input thus far
   - Discontinue unnecessary meds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of colon cancer and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who presented to the ICU with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). The patient initially had bowel perfusion but is now making an excellent recovery with conservative management.

24-hour events:
- The patient's condition improved, with a reversal of cardiomyopathy of shock (CMO) status.
- Hematocrit (Hct) levels remained stable, with no further evidence of active bleeding.
- Chest X-ray showed no free air under the diaphragm.
- The patient was started on ciprofloxacin and flagyl due to concern for microperforation, and white blood cell count decreased this morning.
- The patient tolerated oral intake and resumed oral medications.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Infusions: Other ICU medications: Other medications: Changes to medical and family history: None.
- Social history: The patient lives with his wife in [**Name2 (NI) 4705**], and their son [**Name (NI)**] lives above them.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for intermittent crampy abdominal pain and hematochezia in the rectal tube.
- Vital signs:
   - Temperature (Tmax): 37.1°C (98.8°F)
   - Heart rate (HR): 77 bpm ("

","Summary:
The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient initially refused aggressive intervention but later agreed to continue with surgery. The patient's hemodynamic status has stabilized, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/52 mmHg to 125/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving antibiotics for empirical coverage. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being closely monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient's initial presentation was a large gastrointestinal bleed, which could potentially continue or recur, leading to further blood loss and instability.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics for empirical coverage, suggesting a concern for infection. In the ICU setting, there is a higher risk of developing healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's lab results show a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and elevated lactate levels, indicating potential organ dysfunction, possibly due to hypoperfusion or sepsis.
4. Coagulopathy: The prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and low international normalized ratio (INR) suggest a coag"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a large gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and initially refused aggressive intervention. The patient's condition has stabilized after receiving 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and holding the hematocrit (Hct) from 47 to 44. The patient is currently being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient is likely experiencing consumptive and dilutional coagulopathy due to massive blood loss and transfusion of blood products. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters, such as PT/INR and PTT, is necessary to guide further management.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, with readings ranging from 91/40 mmHg to 117/52 mmHg. This may indicate ongoing hypovolemia or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and appropriate fluid administration are essential.
3. Acid-base imbalance: The patient's ABG results are pending, but the low Hct and ongoing blood loss may lead to metabolic acidosis. Monitoring of acid-base status and adjusting treatment accordingly will be necessary.
4. Infection risk: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Cipro and Flagyl) for empirical coverage, suggesting a concern for infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or worsening leukocytosis, is important.
5. Respiratory support: The patient is on"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and stable hematocrit (Hct) levels. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/65 mmHg to 107/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving various medications including lorazepam, pantoprazole, carafate, and vitamin K. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the LGIB. 

Laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cells (WBC), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), glucose, and electrolytes. The Hct levels have been stable at 44%. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and blood product transfusions as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's history of severe LGIB indicates a potential risk for rebleeding, which can occur in the ICU setting. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and stool output is essential to detect any signs of rebleeding.
2. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive lines increase the risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and a stable hematocrit (Hct) level. The patient has refused surgery and is currently being managed in the ICU. The patient has received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has been treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for suspected infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 144/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals mild upper extremity pitting edema and an abdominal examination showing mild tenderness and board-like rigidity. Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.9 g/dL, platelet count of 199 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 19 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 107 mg/dL, and an elevated INR of 14.3. The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are also low. The patient's medical history includes colon cancer, for which he is being closely followed by his gastroenterologist. There are concerns about possible metastasis due to worsening mesenteric lymphadenopathy and matting seen on a CT scan. The patient has been prescribed proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, and vitamin K supplementation. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is being considered for transfer to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), currently with a stable hematocrit (Hct). The patient has refused surgery and has been managed conservatively. He has received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is being monitored closely. His white blood cell count is improving, and he is not spiking fevers. He continues to have some melena but has maintained a stable Hct for the past 48 hours.

The patient has a history of colon cancer, which is being closely followed by his outpatient gastroenterologist. He presented with concerning symptoms such as weakness and long-term weight loss, along with a CT scan showing worsening mesenteric lymphadenopathy (LAD) and matting, concerning for metastasis of his prior malignancy. There is no current plan for a scope due to recent significant bleeding, but it may be reconsidered as an outpatient procedure.

The patient has also been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. His code status is DNR/DNI, and his CMO status has been reversed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's LGIB could lead to rebleeding, which can be life-threatening and may require urgent surgical intervention or angiographic embolization.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state from massive"

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), now with stable hematocrit (Hct) levels. The patient has a history of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and a computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a sigmoid source of bleeding. Initially, there was active extravasation concerning for perforation, and the patient presented with an acute abdomen. Surgery was consulted, but the patient refused evaluation and intervention. The patient received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His white blood cell count was elevated but is now improving, and he is not spiking fevers. He still has some melena but has maintained stable Hct levels for 48 hours.

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 144/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, and his physical examination reveals a murmur, clear lung sounds, mild tenderness in the abdomen, and resolving upper extremity pitting edema. The patient's lab results show stable electrolyte levels, normal kidney function, and slightly elevated liver enzymes.

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), currently presenting with stable hematocrit levels. The patient has a history of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and a CT abdomen confirmed sigmoid source of bleeding. Initially, there was active extravasation concerning for perforation, but the patient refused surgery. The patient received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and the abdominal exam showed improvement. Subsequent plain film imaging did not reveal evidence of free air. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated but is now improving, without spiking fevers. He still experiences some hematochezia but has stable hematocrit levels for over 24 hours, above 40. 

The patient's medical history includes colon cancer, for which he is being closely followed by his gastroenterologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1726**]. The patient has symptoms concerning for metastasis of his prior malignancy. The patient's goals of care have been discussed, and he has made it clear that he will not consider surgery or other very invasive measures.

The patient also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is prescribed proton pump inhibitor (PPI). He also has hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but his home regimen for hypertension is being held due to GIB.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a medical history of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-stent placement in the left anterior descending artery, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), moderate aortic stenosis, and a remote history of colon cancer (surgery performed on the right hemicolectomy). The patient presented with a massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which was initially managed with 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient is currently stable without signs of active bleeding. However, he still exhibits swelling in his hands, feet, and scrotum.

The patient has received various medications including lorazepam, pantoprazole, carafate, protonix, simvistatin, sulcrafate, detrol, flagyl, cipro, and sucralfate. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the GI bleed. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/32 to 161/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 14.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 145"
