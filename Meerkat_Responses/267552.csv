","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He presents with an exacerbation of heart failure and is currently admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU). The patient has been taking 160mg PO lasix at home without significant improvement in symptoms. His last echocardiogram showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR). He is also experiencing a hypertensive emergency with high diastolic pressures. There is no reported chest pain or history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and the patient has clean coronaries prior to AVR. He is in normal sinus rhythm and continues to be monitored on telemetry. The patient has a history of renal transplant, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy and Lupron, anemia, gout, and familial essential hypertension (FEN). He is currently receiving various medications including nitroglycerin, furosemide, statins, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants, calcitriol, sensipar, allopurinol, and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure: The patient's symptoms, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and history of heart failure indicate ongoing cardiac dysfunction. This may lead to further fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's high diastolic blood pressure puts him at risk for end-organ damage, such as acute kidney injury, stroke, or cardiac rupture. Rapid but controlled reduction in blood pressure is necessary to prevent these complications.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's history of renal transplant and current fluid management (diuresis) may increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte balance is essential.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and indwelling lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of aspirin and other medications may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially considering the stress ulcer prophylaxis regimen.
6. Thromboembolic events: Immobility and hypercoagulability state during the ICU stay can predispose the patient to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications related to his underlying conditions and current treatment in the ICU. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these risks are necessary to optimize the patient's outcomes."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and previous aortic valve replacement (AVR). He presents with exacerbation of heart failure, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been taking high-dose oral Lasix at home without significant improvement in symptoms. His most recent echocardiogram showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), but normal ejection fraction (EF). The patient's blood pressure is high, and he is being treated for a hypertensive emergency. There are also concerns about possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but the trend of cardiac enzymes suggests otherwise. The patient has no active issues related to prostate cancer treatment. He has a history of renal transplant, anemia, gout, and is on immunosuppressive therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure: The patient's symptoms and elevated BNP indicate worsening CHF. Close monitoring of fluid balance, daily weights, and oxygenation is essential. Diuretics will be continued, and further evaluation of the left ventricular function may be required.
2. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's high diastolic pressures need to be managed carefully to prevent organ damage. Gradual reduction of blood pressure while maintaining adequate perfusion is crucial.
3. Possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Although the trend"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presents with an exacerbation of heart failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/93 mmHg to 152/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicating heart failure. The patient has been taking 160mg of oral lasix at home without significant improvement in symptoms. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments. Imaging studies are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure: The patient's elevated BNP levels, history, and examination findings are consistent with CHF. The goal is to wean off nitroglycerin gtt for diuresis and blood pressure control. The patient will receive IV lasix as needed for a goal urine output (UOP) of 2L negative. Monitoring UOP and daily weights is essential.
2. Hypertensive emergency: The patient has high diastolic pressures. The goal is to lower blood pressure but not too quickly. Nitroglycerin gtt will be used to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, renal transplant, hypertension, and chronic heart failure. He presented to the ICU with acute hypertensive crisis and acute decompensated heart failure. The patient's echocardiogram revealed severe left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate left ventricular dilatation, moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with inferior akinesis, bioprosthetic aortic valve with very high gradients, moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and an estimated ejection fraction of 20-25%.

The patient received hydralazine for hypertension, lasix for fluid management, and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His vital signs have been monitored, and he is on prophylactic heparin. The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 918 mL since midnight. He is receiving supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and white blood cell count. Troponin-T levels are within normal range. Other lab values, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to his critical condition. His respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula"

   #. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure: Elevated BNP, history and
   exam consistent with CHF.  Patient takes 160mg PO lasix at home without
   much improvement in symptoms.   Likely [**1-1**] to worsening AS seen on
   echo. Unclear why bovine valve with degenerate so quickly
   -TEE today to evaluate valve
   - Bolus with100mg IV lasix as needed for goal UOP 1L negative.  Monitor
   UOP and daily weights although patient did not meet goal
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Repeat CXR in the AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and previous aortic valve replacement (AVR). He presents with an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and hypertension. The patient has several medical conditions including CAD, atrial fibrillation (AF), anemia, gout, prostate cancer treated with radiation and Lupron, and a history of renal transplant.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
- Heart rate: 75 bpm
- Blood pressure: 155/99 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 94% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination reveals an enlarged left ventricle with a prominent point of maximal impulse (PMI) in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line. There is also evidence of bilateral rales at the lung bases, + ankle edema bilaterally, and an abdominal hernia. The patient's JVP is 10 cm, and there is a systolic ejection murmur at the apex.

Laboratory findings indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels including low sodium, potassium, and magnesium. The patient's troponin T level is within normal range, but his CK-MB level is elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and previous aortic valve replacement (AVR). He presents with an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and a hypertensive emergency. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 155/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen.

The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including an ultrasound and echocardiogram. The echocardiogram revealed severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with moderate left ventricular dilation. There is also moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with inferior akinesis. The patient has a bioprosthetic AVR with very high gradients, making it difficult to assess for vegetation or thrombus on the aortic valve. Additionally, there is at least moderate mitral regurgitation, and diastolic dysfunction with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The estimated ejection fraction (EF) is 20-25%.

The patient has been prescribed several medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), and hydralazine. His allergies include no known drug allergies.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presenting with worsening renal failure, exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertension. The patient has been treated with various medications including lasix, metoprolol, nifedipine, valsartan, lisinopril, ASA, statin, and immunosuppressants. He also receives prophylactic heparin and stress ulcer treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) suggest worsening CHF. It is important to closely monitor his fluid balance and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
2. Hypertensive emergency: Despite weaning off the nitro drip, the patient continues to have elevated diastolic blood pressures. This may be due to worsening renal failure or withdrawal from clonidine. Close monitoring of blood pressure and consideration of medication adjustments are necessary.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. Monitoring renal function closely and addressing potential causes such as overdiuresis or rejection is important.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be monitored, and Aranesp can be administered as per outpatient regimen.
5. Gout: The patient's gout should be managed with"

   s/p AVR who presents with exacerbation of heart failure.
   .
   #. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure: Elevated BNP, history and
   exam consistent with CHF.  Patient takes 160mg PO lasix at home without
   much improvement in symptoms.   Likely [**1-1**] to worsening AS seen on
   echo. Unclear why bovine valve would degenerate so quickly but likely
   contributed to by renal failure. Negative 1600cc yesterday with lasix
   100 IV and has had bump in creatinine. Clinical exam much improved with
   decreased rales and peripheral edema.
   -TEE today to evaluate valve
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Repeat CXR in the AM.

   to have elevated DBPs. [**Month (only) 60**] also be precipitated by worsening renal
   failure or by weaning off his clonidine
   - Restarted all home medications, cont to try and uptitrate for
   improved control by increased metoprolol 50mg PO TID, also on
   nifedipine CR 60 daily, valsartan 320, lisinopril 40

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 56 year old male with history of renal transplant [**2090**],
   s/p AVR who presents with exacerbation of heart failure.
   .
   #. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure: Elevated BNP, history and
   exam consistent with CHF.  Patient takes 160mg PO lasix at home without
   much improvement in symptoms.   Likely [**1-1**] to worsening AS seen on
   echo. Unclear why bovine valve would degenerate so quickly but likely
   contributed to by renal failure. Negative 1600cc yesterday with lasix
   100 IV and has had bump in creatinine. Clinical exam much improved with
   decreased rales and peripheral edema.
   -TEE today to evaluate valve
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Repeat CXR in the AM.
   .
   # Hypertensive emergency-weaned nitro drip off 2 days ago but continues
   to have elevated DBPs. [**Month (only) 60**] also be precipitated by worsening renal
   failure or by weaning off his clonidine
   - Restarted all home medications, cont to try and uptitrate for
   improved control by increased metoprolol 50mg PO TID, also on
   nifedipine CR 60 daily, valsartan 320, lisinopril 40
   - consider uptitration
   - look into role of new meds Lupron, Aranesp for etiology of htn
   - may switch to coreg or labetolol ; will d/w outpatient cardiologist.
   .
   #. CAD: Denies chest pain.  No history of CAD.  Reportedly had clean
   coronaries when worked up prior to AVR.  Slightly elevated troponin
   likely in setting of demand.  Will not treat further for NSTEMI.
   Biomarkers flat
   - Continue ASA, statin
   .
   #. Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Continue beta blockers, CCB
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure s/p renal transplant: Baseline
   creatinine 3.0. Cr slightly up from baseline. FEurea 34, possibly
   prerenal, overdiuresis. Cyclosporin level also less than 25. Will d/w
   real if possibly rejection.
   - Continue immunosuppresant regimen
   - Follow creatinine
   - Continue calcitriol, sensipar
   -appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Anemia: At baseline.
   - Continue to monitor.
   - Aranesp as per outpatient.
   .
   # Gout
   - Continue allopurinol
   .
   # Prostate CA s/p XRT, s/p Lupron: Not an active issue.
   .
   #. FEN
   - Low Na, renal diet
   - Monitor electrolytes and replete PRN
   .
   #. Access:  PIVs
   .
   #. PPx:
   - PPI, bowel regimen, heparin subq

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of renal transplant, who presents with worsening renal failure and exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). He has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, consistent with CHF. The patient takes a high dose of Lasix at home without significant improvement in symptoms. There is evidence of aortic valve stenosis seen on echo, likely contributing to worsening CHF. The patient has also had a recent history of hypertensive emergency, which has been partially treated. He denies chest pain and has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with slightly elevated troponin levels. The patient is in normal sinus rhythm and is on beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. He has acute-on-chronic renal failure post-renal transplant with a baseline creatinine level of 3.0. His FE urea is 34, possibly prerenal, and cyclosporin levels are less than 25. The patient is also being treated for anemia, gout, prostate cancer, and electrolyte imbalances. He is currently on a renal diet and has PIV access. The patient's condition has improved with decreased rales and peripheral edema. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to evaluate the aortic valve. The patient's medications include Lasix, metoprolol, nifedipine, valsartan, lis"
