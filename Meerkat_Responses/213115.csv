","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, experienced a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest during a marathon. Following resuscitation, he was admitted to the ICU. The patient received an angioplasty with stent placement for a long segment of left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 110/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His physical examination reveals no new abnormalities, except for signs of a pseudoaneurysm or hematoma in the groin area. 

Laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels at 0.44, lactic acid levels at 2.6 mmol/L, and a slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The plan includes stopping integrillin, initiating antiplatelet therapy with ASA 325 QD, Plavix 75 QD, and atorvastatin 80 QD. Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID will be started as well. A follow-up echocardiogram will be read, and enzyme levels will be monitored.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who experienced a VF arrest during a marathon. He received a coronary artery catheterization and had a drug-eluting stent placed due to a long segment of LAD stenosis. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 110/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is alert and oriented, with no neurological deficits. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated but decreasing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient had a history of pre-renal azotemia due to the marathon, but his creatinine level has improved from 1.5 to 1.0, indicating resolution of acute kidney injury.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which can be attributed to stress, corticosteroid use, or demargination.
3. Mental status changes: The patient experienced some short-term memory difficulty, but this is improving.
4. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has a history of high cholesterol levels, and he has been started on atorvastatin 80 mg.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who experienced a VF arrest during a marathon. The patient underwent coronary artery catheterization and received a drug-eluting stent for a long segment of LAD stenosis. The patient's condition has been improving, with stabilization of vital signs and resolution of renal failure. The patient's mental status is also improving.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which likely led to exercise-induced ischemia resulting in VF and collapse. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events such as angina, myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias.

2. Stent thrombosis: Although the patient received a drug-eluting stent, there is still a small risk of stent thrombosis, which can lead to myocardial infarction.

3. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has elevated cholesterol levels, and there is a risk of future cardiovascular events if not managed properly.

4. Lactate elevation: The patient had an elevated lactate level, which could be due to the marathon, subsequent arrest, and temporary hypoperfusion. However, the lactate level is falling.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to stress, corticosteroid use, or demargination. This condition usually resolves on its own"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who experienced a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest during a marathon. He was successfully resuscitated and admitted to the ICU. The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal limits. He is alert and oriented, with no neurological deficits. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has no murmurs or extra heart sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated troponin-T levels (0.44), indicating possible myocardial injury, and slightly elevated lactate levels (2.6 mmol/L), which could be due to the marathon and subsequent arrest. His renal function tests show a decrease in hemoglobin (11.0 g/dL) and hematocrit (31.7%), suggesting some blood loss. Other labs, such as white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal range.

The patient has undergone coronary artery catheterization, which revealed a long segment of left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis. A drug-eluting stent was placed to address this issue.

The plan for the patient includes continuing with anticoagulation therapy using Integrillin and starting dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and Plavix. An echocardiogram will be performed in the morning to assess cardiac function. The patient's blood"

   Indication for prophylactic ICD is ventricular fibrillation caused by

   then the stent should have reversed this process.  However, if v fib
   was provoked by an underlying abnormality that we do not know about,
   then the pt might still be at risk for future events and would benefit
   from ICD or require further investigations such as EP study.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who experienced ventricular fibrillation (VF) and collapse during exercise. He underwent coronary artery catheterization, which revealed a long segment of left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis. A drug-eluting stent was placed in the LAD.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/67 to 139/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 37.8°C.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and cardiac troponin T. The patient's hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination is largely unchanged from admission, with notable findings including signs of pseudoaneurysm or hematoma in the groin and a visible jugular venous pulse (JVP) while lying flat.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient likely had exercise-induced ischemia leading to VF and collapse. Coronary artery disease is confirmed with evidence of LAD stenosis, for which a drug-eluting stent was placed. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be 40-45%."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease likely
   had exercise induced ischemia that resulted in VF and collapse.
   Coronary artery catheterization revealed a long segment of LAD
   stenosis. A drug eluting stent was placed.
   Plan
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Patient likely without ACS, but more likely angina with ischemic
   arhythmia (VF) and collapse.  Echo showed mild regional left
   ventricular hypokinesis c/w mid LAD disease and impaired left
   ventricular relaxation. EF 40-45%.  Enzymes trending down
   - ASA 325 QD, Plavix 75 QD, atorvastatin 80 QD
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID
   - start lisinopril 5 mg given depressed EF
   # VF - Rhythm strips obtained from EMS showed v fibrillation.
   Indication for prophylactic ICD is ventricular fibrillation caused by
   irreversible process.  If VF was from ischemia caused by stenosed LAD,
   then the stent should have reversed this process.  However, if v fib
   was provoked by an underlying abnormality that we do not know about,
   then the pt might still be at risk for future events and would benefit
   from ICD or require further investigations such as EP study.
   - Telemetry
   - BB as above
   - cardiac MRI to r/o fibrosis, other areas that could trigger vfib
   - NPO for MRI
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   Previous noted to be 194, per the patient, but was not taking statin.
   Labs show presently his LDL is 98 and t cholesterol is 182.  Goal LDL
   is < 70.
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease. He experienced ventricular fibrillation (VF) during exercise, leading to his current admission. Coronary artery catheterization revealed a long segment of left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis, for which a drug-eluting stent was placed. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be 40-45%. He has been prescribed aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient likely had exercise-induced ischemia resulting in VF and collapse. An echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with mid-LAD disease and impaired left ventricular relaxation. The patient's EF is 40-45%, indicating reduced heart function. Medications include ASA, Plavix, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.
2. VF: Rhythm strips obtained from EMS confirmed VF. The indication for a prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is ventricular fibrillation caused by an irreversible process. If VF was due to ischemia caused by LAD stenosis, the stent should have reversed this process. However, if VF was provoked by an underlying abnormality that we do not know about, the patient might still be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who experienced syncope and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient underwent coronary artery catheterization, which revealed a long segment of left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis. A drug-eluting stent was placed in the LAD.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's physical examination is largely unchanged, except for signs of a pseudoaneurysm or hematoma in the groin area.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, glucose level of 100 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.44 ng/mL, and potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes coronary artery disease, ventricular fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia. The plan involves prescribing aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, and metoprolol succinate. The patient is also advised to follow a cardiac,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease likely
   had exercise induced ischemia that resulted in VF and collapse.
   Coronary artery catheterization revealed a long segment of LAD
   stenosis. A drug eluting stent was placed.
   Plan
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Patient likely without ACS, but more likely angina with ischemic
   arhythmia (VF) and collapse.  Echo showed mild regional left
   ventricular hypokinesis c/w mid LAD disease and impaired left
   ventricular relaxation. EF 40-45%.  Enzymes trending down.  Previous
   records showed LVEF 60% on echo and no perfusion defects on nuclear
   ETT, indicating interval insult to the LAD, which most likely was from
   an ischemic event during the marathon.
   - ASA 325 QD, Plavix 75 QD, atorvastatin 80 QD
   - change to metoprolol succinate 50 mg Q day
   - continue lisinopril 5 mg given depressed EF
   # VF - Rhythm strips obtained from EMS showed v fibrillation.  Cardiac
   MRI obtained to look for other abnormalities/fibrosis that may have
   contained a focus that contributed to the vfib.  Prelim read showed
   endocardial enhancement in the LAD territory consistent with ischemic
   insult.
   - no ICD indicated
   # coping: pt visited by social worker yesterday.
   - SW plans to continue to provide support
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   Previous noted to be 194, per the patient, but was not taking statin.
   Labs show presently his LDL is 98 and t cholesterol is 182.  Goal LDL
   is < 70.
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   # Renal Failure
   Resolved
likely pre-renal from marathon.
   # Leukocytosis
   Likely stress, resolved.
   # Mental Status
   Some short-term memory difficulty initially, which seems to have
   improved.
   - Follow and ask family how he seems later today.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who experienced syncope and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He underwent coronary artery catheterization, which revealed a long segment of left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis. A drug-eluting stent was placed in the LAD. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found to be 60% previously, but it decreased to 34% during an exercise tolerance test (ETT). His cardiac MRI showed endocardial enhancement in the LAD territory consistent with ischemic insult.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/68 mmHg to 127/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is currently on several medications, including aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, metoprolol succinate, and lisinopril.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, glucose, troponin T, and electrolytes. However, there are elevated levels of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase"
