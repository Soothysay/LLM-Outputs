   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute blood loss, chest pain, and hypotension. The patient underwent central venous access via the left internal jugular vein, received a transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and had his hematocrit (HCT) bumped from 19.3 to 27.5. The patient's blood pressure stabilized with fluid and blood products, and he was sent for a CT scan which confirmed hemothorax on the left. The morning HCT was repeated and found to be 24.9, necessitating another 2 units of PRBCs. The patient also received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets in preparation for surgery. Pain control remained challenging, with a switch from morphine IV to hydromorphone IV being made due to escalating pain in the early morning. Ondansetron IV and a bowel regimen were given due to nausea, with no vomiting reported. 

Review of systems reveals left lateral chest pain, flank pain, abdominal pain, and ongoing nausea. There are no known drug allergies. Infusions include pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and hydromorphone. Other medications are also listed.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, all within normal ranges. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP)"

   Assessment and Plan:
   66 year old man with recurrent left pleural effusion and left
   Pleurex/chest tube now with acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic
   shock, presumably from hemothorax.
   # Acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic shock:
   Presumably hemothorax given recent instrumentation; distended/tender
   abdomen also raise concern for hemoperiotneum
   - emergent CVL placement given likely need for vasopressors
   - pRBC transfusion x3 units; crossmatch additional four units
   - once hemodynamically stable, will need emergent CT torso to evaluate
   site of bleeding (chest vs abdomen)
   - Guaiac stools
   - thoracics/IP aware; may need operative intervention tonight pending
   axial imaging
   - if no site of bleeding found, may need urgent TTE to rule out
   tamponade given his low ECG voltages and distant heart sounds (flat
   neck veins
   - stat coags
   ## Chronic systolic and diastolic CHF:
   No acute exacerbation
   - hold antihypertensives for now
   ## Recurrent exudative pleural effusion:
   - f/u cytology and pleural biopsies
   ## DM2
   - sliding scale insulin; hold oral meds
   ## Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: presumably prerenal in the
   setting of hypovolemic shock
   - follow electrolytes for now; check urine lytes if worsening in spite
   of fluids/blood
   ## CAD s/p CABG
   - holding aspirin and clopidogrel given acute bleeding and lack of
   recent stenting
   - holding beta blocker, ACEi for now
   - check cardiac enzymes given ongoing shock

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with recurrent left pleural effusion and left Pleurex/chest tube. He has acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic shock, presumably from hemothorax. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient may continue to experience significant blood loss, leading to further deterioration in hemodynamic stability.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's kidneys may be affected due to prerenal azotemia caused by hypovolemia. Other organs such as the heart, liver, and lungs may also be at risk if the bleeding continues.

3. Infection: The presence of a chest tube and prolonged hospitalization increases the risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may be compromised by pleural effusion and potential lung collapse. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation might be challenging.

5. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery, there is a risk of cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction during the stress of bleeding and potential operative intervention.

6. Thromboembolic events: Immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

7. Metabolic disturbances: The patient may develop electrolyte imbalances and hyperglycemia"

   Pleural fluid cytology is pending.
   Pleural fluid micro cultures are negative thus far.
   Assessment and Plan:
   66 year old man with recurrent left pleural effusion and left
   Pleurex/chest tube now with acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic
   shock, presumably from hemothorax.
   # Acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic shock:
   CT torso early this AM confirms hemothorax. Heterogeneous collection
   may point to coagulated collection that could be difficult to drain
   with chest tube; however, given that patient is poor operative
   candidate, interventional pulmonology would like to attempt chest tube
   placement to relieve hemothorax. Likely source of hemorrhage is one of
   the biopsy sites from pleural biopsies at admission.
   - Continue to check HCT Q4H and transfuse PRBC as needed with goal of
   stabilization of blood volumeon serial checks
   - IP to manage with chest tube initially
   - Thoracic surgery team involved and following closely in case need for
   operative management of hemothorax in event that additional chest tube
   placement by interventional pulmonology is not successful in draining
   current collection
   - FFP as needed to correct coagulopathy
   ## Chronic systolic and diastolic CHF:
   No acute exacerbation. Patient is tolerating fluid and blood product
   resuscitation well.
   - Hold antihypertensives for now
   ## Recurrent exudative pleural effusion:
   Questionable etiology at this point; however, intrapleural pacer wires
   may present nidus for inflammation and chronic effusions.
   - Consult electrophysiology to help sort out active vs. inactive pacer
   wires and potential for removal of leads if the are suspected cause of
   chronic effusions.
   - f/u cytology and pleural biopsies
   ## DM2:
   - sliding scale insulin; hold oral meds
   ## Acute on chronic renal insufficiency:
   Presumably prerenal in the setting of hypovolemic shock.
   - Continue to trend and give fluids as needed to support blood pressure
   and UOP.
   ## CAD s/p CABG:
   Cardiac enzymes are trending up s/p hypotensive and anemic period in
   last few days. Likely demand ischemia instead of a true NSTEMI.
   - holding aspirin and clopidogrel given acute bleeding
   - holding beta blocker, ACEi for now
   - Trend cardiac enzymes given ongoing shock

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute blood loss, chest pain, and hypotension. He has a history of chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recurrent exudative pleural effusion, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient experienced a hemothorax, confirmed by CT scan, and is now presenting with acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic shock. The likely source of hemorrhage is one of the biopsy sites from pleural biopsies at admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has already received blood transfusions, but ongoing blood loss could lead to further anemia and require additional transfusions.
2. Hypovolemic shock: Due to the significant blood loss, the patient is at risk of developing or worsening hypovolemic shock, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Hemothorax: The presence of hemothorax may continue to cause respiratory distress and could potentially lead to empyema if not adequately managed.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has received fluid and blood products, but coagulopathy may still persist and require correction with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or other interventions.
5. Recurrent pleural eff"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 25%, chronic renal failure, and recurrent left exudative effusion. He was admitted for the recurrent left exudative effusion and underwent pleuroscopy and pleural biopsy, with 1.6 liters drained and a chest tube left in place.

The patient's current condition is critical, as indicated by the presence of acute hemorrhage in the left pleural space, hypotension, and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration from 39.3 to 24 and then to 19. An internal jugular line was placed, and the patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). His blood pressure improved, but he experienced left-sided pain.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/50 mmHg to 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, with an ABG showing partial pressures of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate at 19 mmHg, 45 mmHg, and 19 mEq/L, respectively.
