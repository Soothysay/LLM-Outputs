   Pt is a 75 yo F with CAD s/p 3V CABG and critical aortic stenosis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG. However, no evidence of
   ACS (negative troponins, no new ischemic EKG changes). Patient's chest
   pain likely demand ischemia in setting of critical AS and hypertensive
   emergency.
   - continue ASA 325 mg PO daily and zetia 10mg daily
   - continue short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, can uptitrate today to
   75mg TID with goal HR 55-60
   - will restart losartan today after nitroprusside gtt is discontinued
   - treatment of hypertension (see below)
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient presented with hypertensive emergency with
   chest pain. Patient grossly hypertensive in the cath lab with arterial
   tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP brought down by
   nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200. Likely chronically
   hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance due to financial
   issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging from 110s-140s,
   but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal phenomenon.
   Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs that are
   measured via A-line.  Patient
s BP was around 200 overnight on
   nitroprusside gtt.
   - transition nitroprusside gtt to metoprolol and losartan today, goal
   sBP 150 today.
   - has arterial sheath in place for A-line tracings
   - SW consult for med compliance
   .
   # Critical AS: Valve area 0.68 cm^2. Symptomatic with peak gradient of
   25 mm Hg. Has [**12-31**] symptoms for AS triad (angina, CHF).
   - f/u CSurg eval for AVR
   - avoid medications that could decrease preload, such as NTG
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF
   64% in [**1-/2127**]), with elevated PCWP.  Patient also with R sided PA and
   RA pressures on R heart cath, indicating evidence of pulmonary
   hypertension and right-sided heart failure, likely exacerbated in
   setting of L sided heart failure. Receive 40 mg IV lasix in cath lab
   with good urine output of -1 L.   BNP elevated at 2787, consistent with
   heart failure.
   - transition nitroprusside gtt to metoprolol and losartan today, as
   above
   - Pt appears euvolemic currently. Keep I/O even today
   - no nitroglycerin given critical AS
   - f/u Csurg recs on AVR
   - f/u on CXR and TTE today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with history of SVT in 2/[**2125**]. Currently in sinus
   rhythm with prolonged PR and RBBB/left anterior fascicular block on
   EKG.
   - continue BB
   - telemetry
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient with possible vascular dementia
   given hx of PVD and TIAs. A-line [**Location (un) 308**] higher than blood pressure
   cuff, consistent with a diagnosis of PVD.
   - continue ASA, Zetia
   .
   # Carotid artery disease: Patient with history of TIA in [**6-/2125**]
   (significant R sided ICA stenosis).
   - try to obtain carotid U/S records in AM
   - may need carotid U/S here at [**Hospital1 **] for pre-op eval
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Elevated LDL of 134, not at goal. HDL low at 11.
   Patient reportedly on Lipitor but discontinued due to patient concern
   about cirrhosis and possible liver damage.  Patient was put on zetia as
   a result.
   - continue Zetia 10 mg PO daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: BS 191 on admission. Patient without history of
   diabetes.
   - RISS with FS qACHS

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent triple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has critical aortic stenosis. She presented with chest pain and hypertensive emergency, with systolic blood pressures in the 330s. The patient's blood pressure was successfully brought down to 200 with nitroprusside infusion overnight in the CCU. She has a history of medication non-compliance due to financial issues.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:
1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had a CABG procedure but showed no evidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with negative troponins and no new ischemic EKG changes.
2. Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has a valve area of 0.68 cm^2, symptomatic with a peak gradient of 25 mm Hg. She has symptoms of the AS triad (angina, CHF).
3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of diastolic CHF, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 64% and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).
4. Pulmonary Hypertension and Right-Sided Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure, likely exacerbated by left-sided heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 yo F with CAD s/p 3V CABG and critical aortic stenosis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG. However, no evidence of
   ACS (negative troponins, no new ischemic EKG changes). Patient's chest
   pain likely demand ischemia in setting of critical AS and  hypertensive
   emergency.
   - continue ASA 325 mg PO daily and zetia 10mg daily
   - start short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, goal HR 55-60
   - will restart losartan today
   - treatment of hypertension (see below)
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive emergency. Patient grossly hypertensive in
   the cath lab with arterial tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP
   brought down by nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200.
   Likely chronically hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance
   due to financial issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging
   from 110s-140s, but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal
   phenomenon. Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs
   that are measured via A-line.
   - transition nitroprusside gtt to metoprolol and losartan today
   - has arterial sheath in place for A-line tracings
   - SW consult for med compliance
   - consider renal U/S to assess for artery stenosis
   .
   # Critical AS: Valve area 0.68 cm^2. Symptomatic with peak gradient of
   25 mm Hg. Has [**12-31**] symptoms for AS triad (angina, CHF).
   - f/u CSurg eval for AVR
   - avoid medications that could decrease preload, such as NTG
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF
   64% in [**1-/2127**]), with elevated PCWP. Critical symptomatic AS (0.7 cm^2)
   with peak to peak gradient of 25 mm Hg. Patient also with R sided PA
   and RA pressures on R heart cath, indicating evidence of pulmonary
   hypertension and right-sided heart failure, likely exacerbated in
   setting of L sided heart failure. Receive 40 mg IV lasix in cath lab
   with good urine output of -1 L. EF 64% in 3/[**2126**].
   - transition nitroprusside gtt to metoprolol and losartan today
   - no nitroglycerin given critical AS
   - f/u on BNP
   - f/u Csurg recs on AVR
   - f/u on CXR and TTE today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with history of SVT in 2/[**2125**]. Currently in sinus
   rhythm with prolonged PR and RBBB/left anterior fascicular block on
   EKG.
   - continue BB
   - telemetry
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient with possible vascular dementia
   given hx of PVD and TIAs. A-line [**Location (un) 308**] higher than blood pressure
   cuff, consistent with a diagnosis of PVD.
   - continue ASA, Zetia
   .
   # Carotid artery disease: Patient with history of TIA in [**6-/2125**]
   (significant R sided ICA stenosis).
   - try to obtain carotid U/S records in AM
   - may need carotid U/S here at [**Hospital1 **] for pre-op eval
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Elevated LDL of 134, not at goal. HDL low at 11.
   Patient reportedly on Lipitor but discontinued due to patient concern
   about cirrhosis and possible liver damage.  Patient was put on zetia as
   a result.
   - continue Zetia 10 mg PO daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: BS 191 on admission. Patient without history of
   diabetes.
   - RISS with FS qACHS
   - f/u HgA1c
   .
   # Autoimmune Hepatitis with cirrhosis (Child's Class A). Followed by GI
   at [**Hospital1 **].
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25.  Admission hct 30.9. Ferritin checked at OSH
   was 73.
   - trend Hct
   .
   # History of seizure: Patient was admitted for seizure in [**5-5**].  She
   has been on Keppra, but self-discontinued it because of depression. No
   further episodes since then. Will continue to monitor.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and critical aortic stenosis. She presented to the ICU with hypertensive emergency and chest pain, likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of critical AS. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 193/69 mmHg to 112/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including CAD with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.68 cm^2 and peak gradient of 25 mmHg, diastolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 64%, pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure, and evidence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and carotid artery disease.

The patient also has a history of autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis (Child's Class A), anemia, and seizure disorder. She has been admitted for a seizure in the past but has not had any further episodes since then.

In terms of medical management, the patient is on several medications including aspirin (ASA), metoprolol, losartan, zetia, and lasix. She is also receiving IV fluids and nitroprusside for hypertensive emergency. The patient's arterial line and sheath are in place for monitoring and further evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and potential bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of vital signs, cardiac function, renal function, liver function, and electrolyte balance will be necessary to manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and non-compliance with statin and ACE inhibitor medications. He presented to the ICU with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and was found to have aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.05cm2. The patient's current medications include pravastatin and captopril, and he is also receiving nitroprusside. The patient's HgbA1c level is 5.8%, indicating good control of diabetes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has decreased peripheral pulses and evidence of edema, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to poor circulation.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic and Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient's presentation with ADHF suggests a worsening of his chronic heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance, hemodynamics, and respiratory status is necessary.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient's history of CAD puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.05cm2. This condition can lead to syncope, heart failure, and increased risk of"

   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber
   size is normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
   valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.5 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild to
   moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe calcific aortic stenosis. Symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic
   function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 yo F with CAD s/p 3V CABG and critical aortic stenosis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG. However, no evidence of
   ACS (negative troponins, no new ischemic EKG changes). Patient's chest
   pain likely demand ischemia in setting of critical AS and hypertensive
   emergency.
   - continue ASA 325 mg PO daily
   - start pravastatin today
   - continue short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, can uptitrate today to
   75mg TID with goal HR 55-60
   - will start ACEI today while nitroprusside gtt is down-titrated and
   discontinued
   - treatment of hypertension (see below)
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient presented with hypertensive emergency with
   chest pain. Patient grossly hypertensive in the cath lab with arterial
   tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP brought down by
   nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200. Likely chronically
   hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance due to financial
   issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging from 110s-140s,
   but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal phenomenon.
   Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs that are
   measured via A-line.  Patient
s BP was around 200 overnight on
   nitroprusside gtt.
   - transition nitroprusside gtt to metoprolol and ACEI today, goal sBP
   150 today.
   - has arterial sheath in place for A-line tracings
   - SW consult for med compliance
   .
   # Critical AS: Valve area 0.68 cm^2. Symptomatic with peak gradient of
   25 mm Hg. Has [**12-31**] symptoms for AS triad (angina, CHF).
   - f/u CSurg eval for AVR
   - avoid medications that could decrease preload, such as NTG
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF
   64% in [**1-/2127**]), with elevated PCWP.  Patient also with R sided PA and
   RA pressures on R heart cath, indicating evidence of pulmonary
   hypertension and right-sided heart failure, likely exacerbated in
   setting of L sided heart failure. Receive 40 mg IV lasix in cath lab
   with good urine output of -1 L.   BNP elevated at 2787, consistent with
   heart failure.
   - transition nitroprusside gtt to metoprolol and losartan today, as
   above
   - Pt appears euvolemic currently. Keep I/O even today
   - no nitroglycerin given critical AS
   - f/u Csurg recs on AVR
   - f/u on CXR and TTE today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with history of SVT in 2/[**2125**]. Currently in sinus
   rhythm with prolonged PR and RBBB/left anterior fascicular block on
   EKG.
   - continue BB
   - telemetry
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient with hx of PVD and TIAs. A-line
   [**Location (un) 308**] higher than blood pressure cuff, consistent with a diagnosis of
   PVD.
   - continue ASA
   - will start pravastatin today
   .
   # Carotid artery disease: Patient with history of TIA in [**6-/2125**]
   (significant R sided ICA stenosis).
   - may need carotid U/S here for pre-op eval
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Elevated LDL of 134, not at goal. HDL low at 11.
   Patient reportedly on Lipitor but discontinued due to patient concern
   about cirrhosis and possible liver damage.  Patient was put on zetia as
   a result.  Zetia is very expensive; given her economic situation, would
   change to pravastatin.
   - start pravastatin today
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: BS 191 on admission. Patient without history of
   diabetes.
   - RISS with FS qACHS
   - f/u HgA1c
   .
   # Autoimmune Hepatitis with cirrhosis (Child's Class A). Followed by GI
   at [**Hospital1 **]. LFT normal.
   - trend LFT
   .
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25.  Admission hct 30.9. Ferritin checked at OSH
   was 73.
   - trend Hct
   .
   # History of seizure: Patient was admitted for seizure in [**5-5**].  She
   has been on Keppra, but self-discontinued it because of depression. No
   further episodes since then. Will continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a history of critical aortic stenosis, hypertension, and non-compliance with medication due to financial issues. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have severe calcific aortic stenosis, left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation, and moderate mitral regurgitation. She also has evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. The patient's blood pressure was elevated, and she received treatment with nitroprusside followed by metoprolol and ACE inhibitors. She is currently euvolemic and her urine output is good.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe calcific aortic stenosis, which can lead to symptoms such as angina, syncope, and heart failure. Surgical evaluation for aortic valve replacement (AVR) is recommended.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and presented with a hypertensive emergency. She requires ongoing management of her blood pressure, and transition from nitroprusside to metoprolol and ACE inhibitors is planned.
3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient shows evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure with elevated PC"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 yo F with CAD s/p 3V CABG and critical aortic stenosis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG. However, no evidence of
   ACS (negative troponins, no new ischemic EKG changes). Patient's chest
   pain likely demand ischemia in setting of critical AS and hypertensive
   emergency.
   - continue ASA 325 mg PO daily
   - start pravastatin today
   - continue short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, can uptitrate today to
   75mg TID with goal HR 55-60
   - will start ACEI today while nitroprusside gtt is down-titrated and
   discontinued
   - treatment of hypertension (see below)
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient presented with hypertensive emergency with
   chest pain. Patient grossly hypertensive in the cath lab with arterial
   tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP brought down by
   nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200. Likely chronically
   hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance due to financial
   issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging from 110s-140s,
   but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal phenomenon.
   Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs that are
   measured via A-line.  Patient

   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Will further lower blood pressure parenterally for sheath pull. Will
   image thorax per request of interventional cardiology and CT surgery.
   Increase dose of ACE.
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous triple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She presented with a hypertensive emergency and chest pain. The patient has severe calcific aortic stenosis, left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. She also has evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. The patient has a history of SVT, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis, and anemia. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe calcific aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.68 cm^2 and a peak gradient of 25 mm Hg. This condition can lead to symptoms such as angina, syncope, and heart failure.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient initially presented with a hypertensive emergency with systolic blood pressures in the 330s. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to end-organ damage.
3. Left Ventricular Failure: The patient has evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 64%. If not treated adequately, this can lead to progressive heart failure and pulmonary edema.

   # Hypertension: Patient presented with hypertensive emergency with
   chest pain. Patient grossly hypertensive in the cath lab with arterial
   tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP brought down by
   nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200. Likely chronically
   hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance due to financial
   issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging from 110s-140s,
   but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal phenomenon.
   Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs that are
   measured via A-line.  Patient
s BP improved but still not at goal of
   150-160.
   - continue short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, can uptitrate today to
   75mg TID with goal HR 55-60
   - continue captopril 100mg TID
   - may need to add another [**Doctor Last Name **] for BP control for goal sBP 150-160
   .
   # Critical AS: Valve area 0.68 cm^2. Symptomatic with peak gradient of
   25 mm Hg. Has [**12-31**] symptoms for AS triad (angina, CHF).  Pt is getting
   pre-op studies for planned AVR.
   - ordered dental consult and panorex
   - per hepatology consult, pt is a good candidate for surgery from liver
   perspective
   - pt will get CTA today.  Pt with Contrast allergy to be managed with
   pre-treatment (prednisone, ranitidine, benadryl). CTA at 8am today
   - avoid medications that could decrease preload, such as NTG
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG. However, no evidence of
   ACS (negative troponins, no new ischemic EKG changes). Patient's chest
   pain likely demand ischemia in setting of critical AS and hypertensive
   emergency.
   - continue ASA and pravastatin
   - continue short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, can uptitrate today to
   75mg TID with goal HR 55-60
   - continue captopril 100mg TID
   - may need to add another [**Doctor Last Name **] for BP control
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF
   64% in [**1-/2127**]), with elevated PCWP.  Patient also with R sided PA and
   RA pressures on R heart cath, indicating evidence of pulmonary
   hypertension and right-sided heart failure, likely exacerbated in
   setting of L sided heart failure.   BNP elevated at 2787, consistent
   with heart failure.
   - manage BP as above
   - Pt appears euvolemic currently. Keep I/O even today
   - no nitroglycerin given critical AS
   - awaiting AVR surgery
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with history of SVT in 2/[**2125**]. Currently in sinus
   rhythm with prolonged PR and RBBB/left anterior fascicular block on
   EKG.  Currently HR around 60.
   - continue BB
   - telemetry
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient with hx of PVD and TIAs. A-line
   [**Location (un) 308**] higher than blood pressure cuff, consistent with a diagnosis of
   PVD.
   - continue ASA and pravastatin
   .
   # Carotid artery disease: Patient with history of TIA in [**6-/2125**]
   (significant R sided ICA stenosis). Carotid US from [**2125-1-9**] showed
   60-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Less than 40%
   stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Reversed flow in the left
   vertebral artery, which may correspond to subclavian steal phenomenon.
   - pt may live at BP around 200, and if BP drop lower pt may experience
   TIA and dizziness.  Need to monitor for sx.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Elevated LDL of 134, not at goal. HDL low at 11.
   Patient reportedly on Lipitor but discontinued due to patient concern
   about cirrhosis and possible liver damage.  Patient was put on zetia as
   a result.  Zetia is very expensive; given her economic situation, zetia
   changed to pravastatin.
   - continue pravastatin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient without history of diabetes.  HgbA1c 5.8.
   - RISS with FS qACHS
   .
   # Autoimmune Hepatitis with cirrhosis (Child's Class A). Followed by GI
   at [**Hospital1 **]. LFT normal.
   - trend LFT
   - per hepatology, pt is a good candidate for AVR from liver stand
   point.
   .
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25.  Admission hct 30.9. Ferritin checked at OSH
   was 73. Hct stable during this admission.
   - trend Hct
   .
   # History of seizure: Patient was admitted for seizure in [**5-5**].  She
   has been on Keppra, but self-discontinued it because of depression. No
   further episodes since then. Will continue to monitor.

   I would add the following remarks:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of critical aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease post three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, and other comorbidities. She presented with hypertensive emergency and chest pain. Her blood pressure has been difficult to control, and she requires optimization of her antihypertensive regimen. She is also planned for an upcoming aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. Other significant findings include diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis, and a history of seizure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite current treatment, indicating a need for further optimization of the antihypertensive regimen. Non-compliance with medications due to financial issues should be addressed.
2. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, which may worsen over time if not treated. She is planned for AVR surgery, but pre-operative studies need to be completed.
3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of diastolic dysfunction and elevated PCWP, indicating diastolic heart failure. Close monitoring for signs of fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 yo F with CAD s/p 3V CABG and critical aortic stenosis.
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient presented with hypertensive emergency with
   chest pain. Patient grossly hypertensive in the cath lab with arterial
   tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP brought down by
   nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200. Likely chronically
   hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance due to financial
   issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging from 110s-140s,
   but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal phenomenon.
   Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs that are
   measured via A-line.  Patient
s BP improved but still not at goal of
   150-160.
   - continue short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, can uptitrate today to
   75mg TID with goal HR 55-60
   - continue captopril 100mg TID
   - may need to add another [**Doctor Last Name **] for BP control for goal sBP 150-160
   .
   # Critical AS: Valve area 0.68 cm^2. Symptomatic with peak gradient of
   25 mm Hg. Has [**12-31**] symptoms for AS triad (angina, CHF).  Pt is getting
   pre-op studies for planned AVR.
   - ordered dental consult and panorex
   - per hepatology consult, pt is a good candidate for surgery from liver
   perspective
   - pt will get CTA today.  Pt with Contrast allergy to be managed with
   pre-treatment (prednisone, ranitidine, benadryl). CTA at 8am today
   - avoid medications that could decrease preload, such as NTG
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG. However, no evidence of
   ACS (negative troponins, no new ischemic EKG changes). Patient's chest
   pain likely demand ischemia in setting of critical AS and hypertensive
   emergency.
   - continue ASA and pravastatin
   - continue short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, can uptitrate today to
   75mg TID with goal HR 55-60
   - continue captopril 100mg TID
   - may need to add another [**Doctor Last Name **] for BP control
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF
   64% in [**1-/2127**]), with elevated PCWP.  Patient also with R sided PA and
   RA pressures on R heart cath, indicating evidence of pulmonary
   hypertension and right-sided heart failure, likely exacerbated in
   setting of L sided heart failure.   BNP elevated at 2787, consistent
   with heart failure.
   - manage BP as above
   - Pt appears euvolemic currently. Keep I/O even today
   - no nitroglycerin given critical AS
   - awaiting AVR surgery
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with history of SVT in 2/[**2125**]. Currently in sinus
   rhythm with prolonged PR and RBBB/left anterior fascicular block on
   EKG.  Currently HR around 60.
   - continue BB
   - telemetry
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient with hx of PVD and TIAs. A-line
   [**Location (un) 308**] higher than blood pressure cuff, consistent with a diagnosis of
   PVD.
   - continue ASA and pravastatin
   .
   # Carotid artery disease: Patient with history of TIA in [**6-/2125**]
   (significant R sided ICA stenosis). Carotid US from [**2125-1-9**] showed
   60-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Less than 40%
   stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Reversed flow in the left
   vertebral artery, which may correspond to subclavian steal phenomenon.
   - pt may live at BP around 200, and if BP drop lower pt may experience
   TIA and dizziness.  Need to monitor for sx.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Elevated LDL of 134, not at goal. HDL low at 11.
   Patient reportedly on Lipitor but discontinued due to patient concern
   about cirrhosis and possible liver damage.  Patient was put on zetia as
   a result.  Zetia is very expensive; given her economic situation, zetia
   changed to pravastatin.
   - continue pravastatin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient without history of diabetes.  HgbA1c 5.8.
   - RISS with FS qACHS
   .
   # Autoimmune Hepatitis with cirrhosis (Child's Class A). Followed by GI
   at [**Hospital1 **]. LFT normal.
   - trend LFT
   - per hepatology, pt is a good candidate for AVR from liver stand
   point.
   .
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25.  Admission hct 30.9. Ferritin checked at OSH
   was 73. Hct stable during this admission.
   - trend Hct
   .
   # History of seizure: Patient was admitted for seizure in [**5-5**].  She
   has been on Keppra, but self-discontinued it because of depression. No
   further episodes since then. Will continue to monitor.

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, critical aortic stenosis, and previous CABG surgery. She presented with hypertensive emergency and chest pain, and her blood pressure was initially in the 330s. Nitroprusside was used to lower the blood pressure overnight in the CCU to SBPs around 200. It is likely that the patient has chronic hypertension due to medication non-compliance caused by financial issues. Outpatient blood pressure checks have shown SBPs ranging from the 110s to 140s, but these readings were taken in the left arm with known L subclavian steal phenomenon. The cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true blood pressures measured via arterial line. The patient's blood pressure has improved but is still not at the goal of 150-160.

The patient also has critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.68 cm^2 and a peak gradient of 25 mm Hg. She is symptomatic with angina, CHF, and syncope. Preoperative studies are being ordered for planned AVR. The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG surgery, but there is no evidence of ACS. Her chest pain is likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of critical AS and hypertensive emergency.

The patient has evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 64%), elevated PCWP, pulmonary hypertension, and right-sided heart failure, which"

   75 yo F with CAD s/p 3V CABG and critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   later this week.
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient presented with hypertensive emergency & chest
   pain. Patient grossly hypertensive in the cath lab with arterial
   tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP brought down by
   nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200. Likely chronically
   hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance due to financial
   issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging from 110s-140s,
   but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal phenomenon.
   Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs that are
   measured via A-line.  Patient
s BP improved to sbp
s in 160
s yesterday
   with increased Metoprolol 75mg TID & Captopril 100mg TID.
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 75 mg PO TID (goal HR 55-60)
   - Continue Captopril 100mg TID (goal sbp
s 150-170
   .
   # Critical AS: Valve area 0.68 cm^2. Symptomatic with peak gradient of
   25 mm Hg. Has [**12-31**] symptoms for AS triad (angina, CHF).  Pt is getting
   pre-op studies for planned AVR.  Cleared by hepatology for AVR. CTA
   preliminary read demonstrated extensive atherosclerotic disease with
   ectasia of the ascending aorta.
   - Panorex scheduled for today, will then need dental re-consult
   - F/U final CTA read.
   - Avoid medications that decrease preload

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent triple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has critical aortic stenosis. She presented with hypertensive emergency and chest pain, which resolved with improved blood pressure and negative cardiac enzymes. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, heart failure, rhythm disturbances, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and she is being managed with various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which was exacerbated by a hypertensive emergency. It is essential to continue managing her blood pressure to prevent further complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.

2. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.68 cm^2. She is symptomatic with a peak gradient of 25 mm Hg. She is awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedure. Complications related to critical aortic stenosis include heart failure, arrhythmias, and syncope.

3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has known CAD and underwent CABG. There is a risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent triple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is now awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR). The patient presented with hypertensive emergency and chest pain, which resolved after improving blood pressure and initiating appropriate medication adjustments.

The patient has critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.68 cm^2 and symptoms consistent with the AS triad (angina, congestive heart failure). She also has evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and right-sided heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's medical history includes peripheral vascular disease, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), carotid artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis, and a history of seizure. Her current medications include metoprolol, captopril, aspirin, and pravastatin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 160s despite being on increased doses of metoprolol and captopril. Her heart rate is around 60 beats per minute, and she is in sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but other values are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), critical aortic stenosis (AS), and hypertension. She underwent triple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR) later this week. The patient presented with hypertensive emergency and chest pain, and her blood pressure was successfully lowered with nitroprusside infusion. She has evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 64%) with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), indicating pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. Her brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 2787, consistent with heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's history of chronic hypertension and recent hypertensive emergency puts her at risk for further episodes of high blood pressure, which can lead to end-organ damage if not managed appropriately.
2. Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient's critical AS may worsen over time, leading to symptoms such as angina, syncope, and heart failure. If left untreated, it can progress to severe AS and potentially result in sudden cardiac death.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG surgery places her at risk for recurrent ischemic events, including angina, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo F with CAD s/p 3V CABG and critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   later this week.
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient presented with hypertensive emergency & chest
   pain. Patient grossly hypertensive in the cath lab with arterial
   tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP brought down by
   nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200. Likely chronically
   hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance due to financial
   issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging from 110s-140s,
   but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal phenomenon.
   Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs that are
   measured via A-line.  Patient
s BP improved to sbp
s in 160
s yesterday
   with increased Metoprolol 75mg TID & Captopril 100mg TID.
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 75 mg PO TID (goal HR 55-60)
   - Continue Captopril 100mg TID (goal sbp
s 150-170
   .
   # Critical AS: Valve area 0.68 cm^2. Symptomatic with peak gradient of
   25 mm Hg. Has [**12-31**] symptoms for AS triad (angina, CHF).  Pt is getting
   pre-op studies for planned AVR.  Cleared by hepatology for AVR. CTA
   preliminary read demonstrated extensive atherosclerotic disease with
   ectasia of the ascending aorta.
   - Panorex scheduled for today, will then need dental re-consult
   - F/U final CTA read.
   - Cr elevation after dye-load yesterday. F/U Urine electrolytes &
   conservative fluid management PRN.
   - Avoid medications that decrease preload
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG, but patient's chest pain
   on admission likely demand ischemia in setting of critical AS and
   hypertensive emergency as pain resolved with improved bp
s & patient
   with negative troponins, no new ischemic EKG changes.
   - continue ASA and Pravastatin
   - continue Metoprolol 75 mg PO TID
   - continue Captopril 100mg TID
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF
   64% in [**1-/2127**]), with elevated PCWP.  Patient also with R sided PA and
   RA pressures on R heart cath, indicating evidence of pulmonary
   hypertension and right-sided heart failure, likely exacerbated in
   setting of L sided heart failure.   BNP elevated at 2787, consistent
   with heart failure.
   - manage BP as above
   - No nitroglycerin given critical AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with history of SVT in 2/[**2125**]. Currently in sinus
   rhythm with prolonged PR and RBBB/left anterior fascicular block on
   EKG.  Currently HR around 60.
   - continue Metoprolol Tartrate 75mg PO TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient with hx of PVD and TIAs. A-line
   [**Location (un) 308**] higher than blood pressure cuff, consistent with a diagnosis of
   PVD.
   - continue ASA and Pravastatin
   .
   # Carotid artery disease: Patient with history of TIA in [**6-/2125**]
   (significant R sided ICA stenosis). Carotid US from [**2125-1-9**] showed
   60-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Less than 40%
   stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Reversed flow in the left
   vertebral artery, which may correspond to subclavian steal phenomenon.
   - If BP drop lower than sbp
s of 150
s-170
s, pt may experience TIA and
   dizziness.  Will monitor for sx.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Elevated LDL of 134, not at goal. HDL low at 11.
   Patient reportedly on Lipitor but discontinued due to patient concern
   about cirrhosis and possible liver damage.  Patient was prescribed
   Zetia, but given cost, changed to Pravastatin.
   - continue Pravastatin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient without history of diabetes.  HgbA1c 5.8.
   - RISS with FS qACHS
   .
   # Autoimmune Hepatitis with cirrhosis (Child's Class A). Followed by GI
   at [**Hospital1 **]. LFT normal.
   - Trend LFT
   - Per hepatology, pt is a good candidate for AVR.
   .
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25.  Admission hct 30.9. Ferritin checked at OSH
   was 73. Hct stable since admission.
   - Trend Hct
   .
   # History of seizure: Patient was admitted for seizure in [**5-5**].  She
   has been on Keppra, but self-discontinued it because of depression. No
   further episodes since then. Will continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and critical aortic stenosis. She presented with hypertensive emergency and chest pain, likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of critical AS. Her blood pressure was brought down with nitroprusside and she is now on metoprolol and captopril. The patient has evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction of 64%) and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicating heart failure. She also has pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus, but she has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She has peripheral vascular disease and carotid artery disease, and her lipid profile is abnormal. She has a history of seizure disorder and autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis. The patient's anemia has stabilized since admission, and her glycemic control is being monitored. She is currently in the ICU awaiting cardiac surgery later this week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. It is important to continue monitoring and adjusting her medication regimen to maintain blood pressure within the target range.

2. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic st"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of critical aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She presented with hypertensive emergency and chest pain, but her symptoms resolved after improving her blood pressure. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including hypertension, critical AS, CAD, congestive heart failure (CHF), rhythm disturbances, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), carotid artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis, and a history of seizure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension, which can lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney damage if not properly managed.
2. Critical AS (Aortic Stenosis): The patient's critical AS can progress and cause symptoms such as angina, syncope, or heart failure. If left untreated, it can lead to severe complications including sudden cardiac arrest.
3. CAD: The patient's CAD may worsen, leading to recurrent chest pain, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina.
4. CHF: The patient's CHF symptoms may worsen if her cardiac function deteriorates or if her blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
5. Rhythm disturbances: The patient's rhythm disturbances can progress and lead to palpitations, fainting, or an increased risk of stroke.
6. PVD"
