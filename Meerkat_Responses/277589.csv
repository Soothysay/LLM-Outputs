   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with ESRD on HD, CAD, PVD, DM2, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, PAF,
   who is transferred from OSH for NSTEMI and respiratory distress
   # CORONARIES: Patient has known 2V CAD by prior angiography; has
   diffuse disease that was not intervenable on prior cath.  During the
   OSH course, patient was found to have NSTEMI with positive biomarkers
   and ECG with ST depressions in inferolateral leads.
   - cont asa, statin, plavix, b-blocker
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - NPO after midnight for cardiac cath in AM to evaluate coronaries and
   potentially intervene on any culprit lesions
   # PUMP:  history of CHF exacerbation with previously depressed EF but
   most recent ECHO with EF about 50%.  Possible that he had pulmonary
   congestion in the setting of NSTEMI.
   - cont b-blocker
   - dialyzed today for volume; may consider further dialysis if CXR with
   signifcant pulm edema. has some bibasilar crackles but not overt CHF
   # RHYTHM: afib, rate controlled.  not on coumadin as outpatient, on ASA
   and plavix
   - currenlty on heparin gtt for NSTEMI
   - will need to discuss with cardiologist why patient is not on
   anticoagulation
   # Respiratory Distress: Initially required 6L O2 with hypoxia and
   tachypnea.  Possible causes include pulm edema [**2-24**] NSTEMI, PNA
   (recently treated with cipro), PE.  Patient on 2-3L O2 at home,
   currently on same amount
   - CXR
   - hold off on abx for now; no leukocytosis, no fever
   - on heparin gtt; unlikely PE since currently improved; though still on
   differential
   # ESRD on HD: followed by renal.  HD today prior to transfer
   - d/w renal team in AM for further recs
   - lytes, replete PRN
   - cont nephrocaps and sevelamer
   # PVD: has had multiple amputations in the past.  has pain on
   movement.  followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2762**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with several medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary arterial fibrillation (PAF). The patient was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/52 mmHg to 160/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has received heparin sodium infusions and other medications such as aspirin (asa), clopidogrel (plavix), and statin. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was not mentioned.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished pulses in both radial and distal pulses, crackles bibasilar on chest auscultation, warm skin, and muscle wasting. Neurological assessment shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person and city, and has purposeful movements"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation (AF). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress and underwent cardiac catheterization. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate ranging from 48-80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113-141/37-68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has crackles at the bases bilaterally on chest examination and an eschar at the site of a previous amputation. His laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as a slightly elevated troponin-T level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and AF, and his recent ECG showed ST depressions in inferolateral leads. He is currently on multiple cardiac medications including aspirin, statin, Plavix, and a beta-blocker. It is important to monitor his cardiac status closely during and after the catheterization procedure.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient has crackles at the bases bilaterally, indicating possible fluid accumulation"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation (AF). He was transferred to the ICU for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and respiratory distress.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization due to the recent NSTEMI. He is currently on various medications including aspirin (asa), statin, Plavix, and beta-blockers. His heparin gtt has been continued for now. 

The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation with previously depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), but his most recent echocardiogram shows an EF of about 50%. This improvement may be attributed to the pulmonary congestion associated with the recent NSTEMI. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by his ESRD and recent dialysis. Fluid removal will continue during hemodialysis. His hypertension is managed with isosorbide mononitrate, lisinopril, metoprolol, nifedipine, and diltiazem. 

The patient's rhythm is controlled with diltiazem, and there"

The patient was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation and management of respiratory distress.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, where a right coronary artery (RCA) stent was placed. He completed a hemodialysis session and is now off heparin drip. The patient has a positive guaiac positive stool, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. His hematocrit (HCT) level is stable at 29-30%. He is likely to be transferred to Hospital Unit 3031 after the post-cath check.

The patient is alert and oriented to person and partially to place. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F), heart rate of 77 bpm with atrial fibrillation (AF), blood pressure ranging from 164/55 mmHg to 173/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary embolism and/or atrial fibrillation (PAF). The patient was transferred from another hospital for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and respiratory distress. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA). He completed a session of HD and is now off heparin drip. The patient has a positive stool guaiac, hemoglobin concentration (HCT) of 29-30, and has been in atrial fibrillation (Afib) all night.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, and Afib puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and presence of crackles at the bases bilaterally may indicate fluid overload or pulmonary edema.
3. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD on HD and recent findings of elevated creatinine levels suggest ongoing renal dysfunction. Fluid removal during HD should be closely monitored.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's elevated international normalized"

   75 yo male with ESRD on HD, CAD, PVD, DM2, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, PAF,
   who is transferred from OSH for [**Year (4 digits) **] and respiratory distress
   # CORONARIES: Patient has known 2V CAD by prior angiography; has
   diffuse disease that was not intervenable on prior cath (LAD known
   occlusion, OM 70%, RCA 50% distally).  During the OSH course, patient
   was found to have [**Year (4 digits) **] with positive biomarkers and ECG with ST
   depressions in inferolateral leads.  Given [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] require
   reassessment
   - Patient will have cath
   - Continue asa, statin, plavix, b-blocker
   - Continue his heparin gtt for now
   # PUMP:  history of CHF exacerbation with previously depressed EF but
   most recent ECHO with EF about 50%.  Possible that he had pulmonary
   congestion in the setting of [**First Name3 (LF) **].  His CXR [**12-25**] did not appear to
   have significant pulmonary congestion, but pt w/ crackles on exam and
   elevated JVD on exam today.
   - Will continue fluid removal per HD
   - Continue b-blocker as prior this AM
   - Given his renal failure holding digoxin.
   - For htn continue isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg daily, lisinopril 40 mg
   daily, and metoprolol 100 mg daily;
   # RHYTHM: afib, rate controlled.  not on coumadin as outpatient, on ASA
   and plavix.  Has had episodes of bradycardia at night, now resolved.
   - Currently on heparin gtt for [**Month/Day (2) **]
   - Continue BBK
   - will need to discuss with cardiologist why patient is not on
   anticoagulation.
   - hold CCB as pt. in cath in AM and this is primarily driven by SBPs
   (see below)
   # HTN
 SBP control improved, mostly in 120s
 140s.  CCB and BBK held
   o/n.  Goal < 130/80.
   -          Continue BBK
   -          Consider restarting CCB is SBP > 140s consistently,
   monitoring for hypotension and bradycardia.
   # ESRD on HD: followed by renal.  HD today scheduled after cath.  Phos
   climbing to 5.6.
   - Appreciate renal involvement
   - lytes, replete PRN
   - cont nephrocaps and sevelamer, consider increase in sevelamer.
   # PVD: has had multiple amputations in the past.  has pain on
   movement.  followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2762**]. Has hx of peripheral neuropathy.
   -          Consider gabapentin QHS for neuropathy after dialysis.
   -          Continue acetaminophen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and prosthetic aortic valve (PAF). The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and underwent a right below-the-knee amputation due to peripheral arterial disease. He also had an occlusion in the left anterior descending artery.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 164/55 mmHg to 173/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on several medications including aspirin, statin, Plavix, beta-blocker, and heparin.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine, and high potassium levels. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating between 133 mg/dL and 173 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has crackles present at the bases bilaterally on lung examination, elevated jugular venous distention (JVD), and peripheral edema"

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and persistent atrial fibrillation (PAF). The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory distress and was found to have acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with positive biomarkers and ECG changes. He underwent coronary angiography and stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently in the ICU and is expected to be transferred to CCU after post-catheterization check. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 164/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient has crackles at the bases bilaterally and jugular venous distention (JVD) of 12 cm. He is alert and oriented, with a right foot that underwent amputation and an eschar at the site. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, and his electrolytes and kidney function are being closely monitored. The patient is on various medications including aspirin, statin, Plavix, beta-blocker, and heparin drip.
