   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with h/o diastolic CHF and recent PNA now admitted
   with cough and hypoxia, found to have possible pneumonia and probable
   CHF exacerbation.
   .
   #) Pneumonia - Patient has new oxygen requirement, new cough, and CXR
   showing possible new infiltrate concerning for a pneumonia. Has HAP
   risk factors and h/o MRSA. Also concern for aspiration. Pt low grade
   febrile in ED but afebrile since admission. Will need to reassess
   repeat CXR this am for infiltrate and consider PA and lateral to
   further characterize if poor study.
   -- Continue vanc and cefepime for HAP for now and consider narrow
   regimen based on clinical picture, repeat CXR, fever curve, cx data
   -- sputum cultures
   -- urine legionella
   -- nebs and supplemental O2
   .
   #) Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF - hypoxic with an oxygen requirement
   and basilar rales on exam with elevated BNP c/w prior consistent with
   CHF exacerbation.
   -- begin diuresis with lasix 20mg IV x 1 when BP stable off pressors
   -- strict I/Os, daily weights
   -- low Na diet
   -- hold lisinopril and metoprolol in setting of acute decompensation.
   Will restart at discharge
   .
   # L hand pain: This has been chronic issue for patient. Pain noted in
   prior DC summary from [**Month (only) **]. She was admitted on and discharged on
   Tramadol 50 prn.
   -          restarted Tramadol 50 prn. Hold for sedation .
   # Agitation: Pt agitated this am on exam around 2 am, again around
   6-7am. She calmed down after left hand pain treated with tramadol. Also
   re-oriented frequently. O2 sats decreased with agitation. ? possible
   etiology of agitation. O2 requirement less this am. Would attempt
   reorientation, Zyprexa 0.25 ODT prn agitation if further episodes but
   would like to avoid polypharmacy if possible
   .
   #Anemia: HCT decreased from 36.1 to 28.5 over less than 24 hours. Most
   likely 36 is false read given chronically anemic with baseline HCT
   appears to be low 30s. Unlikely to have bleed given no BM, no obvious
   bleed. Will repeat HCT and re-eval. - -
   -          Guaiac stool
   -          Repeat HCT
   .
   #) Hypotension - developed s/p nitro gtt, requiring neosynephine.
   Family understands that peripheral pressors may not be continued more
   than 24 hours. Off pressors now since 2 am. BP stable with MAP >60
   -- follow for now, BP stable off pressors
   .
   #) Intermittent SVT - On previous admission, patient had significant
   asymptomatic atrial ectopy with many runs of SVT. Was in this rhythm in
   the ED. Previously, she did not tolerate beta blockade due to
   symptomatic bradycardia
   -- monitor on tele. Currently NSR
   -- holding BB given hypotension and prior bradycardia
   .
   #) CAD - Patient has no history of symptomatic CAD, but had a troponin
   leak in prior hospitalization which was attributed to strain in the
   setting of atrial ectopy and SVT. No compelling evidence of ongoing
   cardiac ischemia to explain current sxs (EKG, CE's x 2 neg)
   -- continue ASA 81mg daily
   -- r/o with 2 sets negative biomarkers
   -- telemetry
   .
   # Osteoporosis -
   -- continue daily vitamin D and calcium, and fosamax 70 mg qSat.
   .
   # Chronic Venous Stasis
 BL LE erythema, edema concerning for
   cellultitis but unchanged from baseline per son, patient and noted in
   prior notes as well. Less likely to be cellulitis given chronic nature,
   bilaterality.
   -- continue skin creams
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV, no central access per goals of care
   .
   # FEN -
   -- Patient had a normal S/S eval in [**7-25**], no overt signs or symptoms of
   aspiration, soft diet
   -- replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx -
   -- sQ heparin
   -- bowel regimen
   -- home PPI
   .
   # Dispo
   -- Will call out since off pressors, no need for further ICU level care
   since refusing central access, DNR/DNI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of diastolic CHF and recent pneumonia who was admitted with cough and hypoxia. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has new oxygen requirements, cough, and a possible new infiltrate on the chest X-ray, which are concerning for pneumonia. She also has risk factors for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and a history of MRSA. The plan is to continue vancomycin and cefepime for HAP, reassess the chest X-ray, and consider narrowing the antibiotic regimen based on clinical picture, repeat CXR, fever curve, and culture data.

2. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient is hypoxic with an oxygen requirement and has basilar rales on examination, indicating possible fluid overload. The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is consistent with CHF exacerbation. The plan is to begin diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV when the patient's blood pressure is stable off pressors, monitor strict input/output (I/O) and daily weights, recommend a low sodium diet, and hold lisinopril and metoprolol during acute decompensation.

3. L Hand Pain: The patient has a chronic issue with pain in her left hand, which was previously documented. She was admitted and discharged on tramadol 50"

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has received Lasix 20 mg IV for fluid overload with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 77 bpm with a range of 62-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/37 mmHg to 138/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute with a range of 19-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and is not on any other respiratory support.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 31 mL since 12 AM, with an output of 170 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -139 mL. The patient's blood products and urine output are within normal limits. The patient's NG (nasogastric) tube and drains are not assessed. 

The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) results indicate a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, PaO2 of 123 mmHg, and HCO3- of 123 mEq/L. The patient's oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypotension. She has a history of allergies to penicillins and is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is receiving respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral lower extremity erythema from knee to shin, warm skin, and fair air movement in the chest. Laboratory results show anemia, low potassium, and elevated white blood cell count.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress, likely due to pulmonary edema with possible concomitant nosocomial pneumonia. The patient is now off Neo and may be able to diurese gently.
2. Systolic congestive heart failure. If the patient remains on pressors, she may be able to start a low dose of lasix late in the morning and quantify true oxygen requirements.
3. Supraventricular tachycardia. The patient is currently stable in sinus rhythm and will restart beta-blocker in the next 24 hours if able.
4. Anemia. This hematocrit level is actually at baseline, and the healthcare team will trend guiac all stools.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and cough. She has a history of acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia. The patient's symptoms suggest worsening CHF and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with risk factors such as being elderly, hypoxic, and having a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient also has chronic venous stasis with erythema and edema in both lower extremities, which may be concerning for cellulitis, but has been present for a while and is less likely to be cellulitis given its chronic nature and bilaterality.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia - The patient's new oxygen requirement, cough, and chest X-ray showing new infiltrate are concerning for pneumonia. Given her risk factors and history of MRSA, there is a possibility of multi-drug resistant pneumonia.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - The patient's hypoxia, basilar rales on exam, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and previous history of CHF indicate an exacerbation of her chronic condition.
3. Hypotension - The patient developed hypotension after nitroglycerin administration and required vasopressor support. Monitoring her blood pressure and adjusting medication accordingly is important to prevent further episodes of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, which resulted in a rash. The patient received antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefepime) within the past 24 hours.

Infusions and medications currently being administered include Haloperidol (Haldol) for sedation, Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. The patient's medical and family history is unchanged from admission.

Review of systems remains unchanged except for the current symptoms. Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal range, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/52 mmHg to 150/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable fluid balance with total intake and output being 838 mL and 635 mL respectively. Blood products have been administered, but the amount is not specified. Urine output is within normal range at 635 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a face tent, and ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation.

Physical examination findings include stable peripheral pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment pending further evaluation. Lab results show slight variations in"

   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress- likely a component of pulmonary edema
   with possible concomitant nosocomial PNA. Did not have the BP to allow
   for much diuresis
 but now off Neo so may be able to diurese gently.
   For PNA- Vanco Cefipime, follow up CX and repeat CXR.
   2.       Systolic CHF- if stays pressors may be able to start a low
   dose lasix late AM

   3.       SVT: stable in sinus currently. Holding bblockade right now
   but will restart in next 24 hours if able.
   4.       Anemia: this HCT is actually at baseline, will trend guiac all

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. She has a history of penicillin allergy and is currently on various medications including haloperidol and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/57 to 150/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is being supported with a face tent and has a slightly elevated PaCO2 level on the arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.

Physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, persistent coughing, bronchial breath sounds at the left base, inspiratory rales, soft abdomen, chronic venous stasis changes, and alertness with complaints of shortness of breath. The chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral pulmonary edema with more focal left lower lobe opacity. Laboratory tests indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 194 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxemic respiratory distress, likely due to pulmonary edema and possible nosocomial pneumonia. She also has anemia and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The"

","Summary:
The patient is a elderly woman experiencing respiratory distress, with a history of aspiration and small desaturation episode during dinner. She was kept overnight in the MICU for observation. The patient has allergies to penicillins and a rash reaction. She has been receiving various medications including haloperidol, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 135/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent aspiration event. Her physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, persistent coughing, bronchial breath sounds at the left base with inspiratory rales, soft and non-tender abdomen, chronic venous stasis changes on extremities, and alert conversation with complaints of shortness of breath. The chest X-ray shows significantly worsened bilateral pulmonary edema with fluid in fissures, more focal left lower lobe opacity. Laboratory results indicate a low white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, normal electrolytes, and normal cardiac enzymes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of focal left lower lobe opacity on the chest X-ray raises the possibility of pneumonia, especially considering the patient's recent aspiration event.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and cough likely
   secondary to acute on chronic diastolic CHF and PNA.
   .
   #) Pneumonia - Patient has new oxygen requirement, new cough, and CXR
   showing new infiltrate concerning for a pneumonia. Has HAP risk factors
   and h/o MRSA. Also concern for aspiration. Pt low grade febrile in ED
   but afebrile since admission. Repeat CXR and physical exam concerning
   for L pneumonia
   -- Continue vanc and cefepime for HAP
   -- Follow blood cx, fever curve, unable to obtain sputum specimen
   -- urine legionella neg
   -- nebs and supplemental O2
   -- chest PT
   .
   #) Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF - hypoxic with an oxygen requirement
   and basilar rales on exam with elevated BNP c/w CHF exacerbation.
   -- begin diuresis with lasix 20mg IV x 1 since BP now stable off
   pressors
   -- strict I/Os, daily weights
   -- low Na diet
   -- hold lisinopril and metoprolol in setting of acute decompensation.
   Will restart when BP more stable
   .
   # L hand pain: This has been chronic issue for patient. Pain noted in
   prior DC summary from [**Month (only) **]. She was admitted on and discharged on
   Tramadol 50 prn.
   -          restarted Tramadol 50 prn. Hold for sedation .
   # Agitation: Pt agitated this am on exam again, given Haldol for
   agitation. She calmed down after left hand pain treated with tramadol.
   Also re-oriented frequently. O2 sats decreased with agitation. ?
   possible etiology of agitation. O2 requirement less this am. Would
   attempt reorientation, Haldol prn
   .
   #Anemia: HCT decreased from 36.1 to 28.5 over less than 24 hours. Most
   likely 36 is false read given chronically anemic with baseline HCT
   appears to be low 30s. Unlikely to have bleed given no BM, no obvious
   bleed. Will repeat HCT and re-eval. - -
   -          Guaiac stool
   -          Repeat HCT
   .
   #) Hypotension - developed s/p nitro gtt, requiring neosynephine.
   Family understands that peripheral pressors may not be continued more
   than 24 hours. Off pressors now since 2 am. BP stable with MAP >60
   -- follow for now, BP stable off pressors
   .
   #) Intermittent SVT - On previous admission, patient had significant
   asymptomatic atrial ectopy with many runs of SVT. Was in this rhythm in
   the ED. Previously, she did not tolerate beta blockade due to
   symptomatic bradycardia
   -- monitor on tele. Currently NSR
   -- holding BB given hypotension and prior bradycardia
   .
   #) CAD - Patient has no history of symptomatic CAD, but had a troponin
   leak in prior hospitalization which was attributed to strain in the
   setting of atrial ectopy and SVT. No compelling evidence of ongoing
   cardiac ischemia to explain current sxs (EKG, CE's x 2 neg)
   -- continue ASA 81mg daily
   -- r/o with 2 sets negative biomarkers
   -- telemetry
   .
   # Osteoporosis -
   -- continue daily vitamin D and calcium, and fosamax 70 mg qSat.
   .
   # Chronic Venous Stasis
 BL LE erythema, edema concerning for
   cellultitis but unchanged from baseline per son, patient and noted in
   prior notes as well. Less likely to be cellulitis given chronic nature,
   bilaterality.
   -- continue skin creams
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV, no central access per goals of care
   .
   # FEN -
   -- Patient had S/S eval recommended pureed with nectar thick liquids,
   1:1 supervision
   -- replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and cough, likely due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has new oxygen requirements, a new cough, and a chest X-ray showing a new infiltrate, which raises concerns for pneumonia. The patient also has risk factors for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Aspiration is also a concern.
2. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient is hypoxic and requires supplemental oxygen. She has basilar rales on examination, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and previous admissions for CHF exacerbations. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid buildup.
3. Hand pain: The patient has chronic hand pain, which has been noted before. It may be related to a previous diagnosis of osteoarthritis.
4. Agitation: The patient has shown signs of agitation, which may be due to pain, confusion, or other factors. Haloperidol has been used to manage agitation.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level decreased from 36.1% to 28."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been receiving various medications, including diuretics (Furosemide), antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefipime), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/57 to 110/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99% on a face tent.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 840 mL of total fluids, with outputs including 540 mL of urine, 300 mL of IV fluids, and 500 mL of blood products, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,675 mL.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, sodium level of 120 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.8 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.02, and blood glucose levels ranging from 77 to 120 mg/dL.

The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular pulses, skin condition, neurologic status, or other physical exam findings.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female who is experiencing respiratory distress and recurrent aspiration with eating. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on anticoagulation therapy with heparin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, increased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. She is receiving respiratory support with a face tent and has abnormal findings on physical examination, including egophony at the left base and rales on the right side. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and renal dysfunction. Imaging studies show evidence of pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to recurrent aspiration events, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current use of anticoagulation therapy put her at risk for developing other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or atrial flutter.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate indicate a risk of respiratory failure, especially considering her underlying lung pathology.
4. Sepsis: The presence of recurrent aspiration events and potential bacterial colonization in the lungs may increase the risk of developing sepsis.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function,"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has a history of recurrent aspiration while eating and desaturation in atrial fibrillation. She is currently experiencing respiratory distress, cough, and dyspnea. Her vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. The patient is on various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide, and other ICU medications. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. Her flow sheet data indicates a positive fluid balance and she is receiving supplemental oxygen through a face tent. The physical examination reveals irregular heart rhythm, egophony at the left base, and rales on the right side. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal kidney function. The assessment and plan include controlling atrial fibrillation with IV beta-blocker and starting a low-dose beta-blocker. The patient is also being treated for pneumonia, anemia, and hypoxemic respiratory distress. She is NPO due to aspiration and has a DNR/DNI code status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress, cough, and dyspnea, along with the presence of rales on chest examination, suggest a possible pneumonia. If left untreated, it can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient experienced several significant events overnight, including diuresis, agitation treated with haloperidol, decreased oxygen requirement, desaturation in the 80s when off nasal cannula, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and the aspiration of pills.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and rashes. She was previously on vancomycin and cefepime, both administered intravenously. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix) for diuresis, and metoprolol 5mg IV QID.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of cough. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate ranging from 74-137 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/43-150/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1675 mL since 12 AM and total input/output of 840/480 mL. The patient's blood products, urine output, and drain outputs are within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of diuresis overnight. The patient received haloperidol for agitation and had decreased oxygen requirement, but desaturated to the 80s when off nasal cannula. The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response this morning and was broken with metoprolol 2.5mg x2. The patient has allergies to penicillins and experienced a rash as a last dose of antibiotics. The patient is currently on various infusions including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough and absence of dyspnea, tachypnea, chest pain, and palpitations. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm (74-137 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 150/66 mmHg to 110/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus arrhythmia, and they have received a total of 840 mL of fluids since midnight. The patient's blood products, urine output, and other fluid balances are also noted. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///32/. Physical examination reveals a thin general appearance,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of her condition, along with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). The patient is on multiple medications including diuretics, beta-blockers, and antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a fever and crackles in her lungs. Laboratory results show mild anemia and elevated potassium levels. The patient's nutritional intake is limited due to swallowing difficulties, so she is on a pureed diet with close supervision. She is at risk for aspiration and has strict infection control measures in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles in the lungs suggest worsening CHF. If not managed properly, this could lead to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory infections: Given the patient's HCAP, she is at risk for developing additional respiratory infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adherence to infection control protocols are crucial.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's swallowing difficulties and aspiration risk, there is a potential for aspiration pneumonia. Maintaining proper head positioning and implementing appropriate feeding techniques are essential to minimize this risk.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's elevated potassium levels may indicate renal dysfunction or medication"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of an acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). The patient experienced episodes of desaturation to the 130s and had runs of AF in the 130s. Metoprolol was started at 2.5 mg twice daily, but the patient's oral intake was suctioned out, so the medication is now being given intravenously at 5 mg every 4 hours.

The patient has a history of chronic venous stasis with stable erythema, osteoporosis, and chronic aspiration per nursing notes. She has been placed on meropenem for suspected resistant organism or aspiration pneumonitis, and her antibiotic regimen has been changed to broaden coverage.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), blood pressure ranging from 120/70 mmHg to 95/50 mmHg, heart rate of 65-137 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, glucose of 97 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4."

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of known diastolic dysfunction and is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, likely due to a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The patient also has anemia and fever. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and high respiratory rate.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if the underlying cause, such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema, is not adequately treated. This could lead to further deterioration of oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The presence of fever and worsening consolidation on examination suggests a possible infection, either nosocomial pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. If left untreated, this could progress to sepsis or septic shock.

3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is within normal range, but there is a history of anticoagulation with heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. However, the total input of fluids is higher than output, suggesting a risk of fluid overload, especially considering the patient's known diastolic dysfunction.

5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with respiratory distress. She is experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. Her physical examination shows signs of pneumonia, such as egophony at the left base and rales on the right side. The patient also has irregular heart rhythm, edema, and difficulty hearing. Laboratory results indicate anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula and oxygen delivery. The patient has been on various antibiotics empirically to cover different types of infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest pneumonia. If left untreated or not effectively managed, it can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
2. Aspiration: Given the patient's inability to protect her airway and the presence of volume overload, there is a risk of aspiration, which can result in further respiratory compromise.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has irregular heart rhythm and diastolic dysfunction. These cardiac conditions, if not adequately managed, can contribute to poor oxygenation and cardiac failure.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, indicating anemia. If not treated appropriately, anemia can worsen the patient's overall condition, including respiratory distress.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary emb"

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp Distress
   Pneumonia
   Anemia
   1.       Afib with RVR: precipitated by hypoxemia, some volume
   overload, aspiration. Now resolved. We will control acutely bblocker,
   can convert to crushed po meds. With her diastolic  dysfunction needs
   adequate filling time.
   2.            Hypoxemic Resp Distress- combination of pulmonary edema
   and Pneumonia We added meropenem empirically to double cover GNR
   yesterday for nosocomial PNA.  Get additional sputum samples.  Goal 500
   cc neg a day
   3.            Anemia: this HCT is actually at baseline, will trend

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has a history of allergies to penicillins and has received multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and meropenem. The patient's fever is 101.1°F, and she has an irregular heartbeat. Physical examination shows signs of decreased rales on the right side and egophony at the left base. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but her heart rate and respiratory rate are elevated. Her oxygen saturation is 88%, and she requires respiratory support with high flow nebulization and a face tent. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging is not available for review.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and has low oxygen saturation. This could be due to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or both. Immediate intervention is necessary to improve oxygenation and treat the underlying cause.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: Given the patient's prolonged ICU stay and antibiotic usage, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia. Further investigation through sputum cultures and additional antibiotics may be required.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is at the lower end of the normal range. Monitoring for any worsening of anemia and ensuring adequate nutritional intake are important.
