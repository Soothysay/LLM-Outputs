   Chief Complaint: LLE pain/swelling, new diagnosis of DLBCL
   24 Hour Events:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 13803**] is a 67 year old male with a history of DM2, OSA, and
   nephrolithiasis who was recently seen at [**Hospital 358**] hospital for LLE pain
   and swelling, diagnosed with DLBCL, and transfered to [**Hospital1 19**] early this
   morning for tertiary care.  Please see MICU-[**Location (un) **] admission note.
   .
   Over the course of today the patient had an IVC filter placed by
   vascular surgery.  Neurology recommended MR head, spine, and LS plexus
   with and without gad to further evaluate extent of disease.  LLE
   symptoms are felt to be secondary to extrinsic compression by the tumor
   in the pelvis rather than compartment syndrome.  Patient had no further
   emesis and remained on heparin gtt.  GI requested NG lavage which
   patient declined.  Pathology reviewed OSH slides and confirmed
   diagnosis.  Heme-Onc evaluated patient and recommended starting
   chemotherapy with CHOP this evening which is why the patient is being
   transfered from MICU-[**Location (un) 144**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].  He has already been started
   on decadron.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, the patient was comfortable, but overwhelmed by
   the events of the day.  He denied any current shortness of breath
   though he has had increasing shortness of breath with activity over the
   last couple of months.  He additional denied current chest pain,
   palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain, or LLE pain.  He does have pain
   in his left hip with movement.

   lymphadenopathy. Extensive subcutaneous edema in the left thigh.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with newly diagnosed DLBCL compressing vasculature and nerves
   to LLE with LLE DVT, thrombocytopenia and anemia.
   .
   #) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Lymph node pathology at OSH with
   diagnosis of DLBCL, confirmed by pathology here. Oncology recommended
   chemotherapy; no role for radiation at present. HIV and Hepatitis
   titers sent per heme/onc recs.  Bedside [**Month/Day (2) **] performed this evening with
   good EF per cardiologist (final read pending).  Concern for potential
   tumor lysis with elevated LDH.
   - f/u serologies
   - initiate chemotherapy this evening with CHOP per BMT recs
   - f/u final [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **]
   - Q6H tumor lysis labs
   - hydration with NaHCO3
   - allopurinol to decrease risk of urate nephropathy
   - MR head and spine with and without gad to evaluate for CNS
   involvement.
   .
   #) LLE DVT - felt secondary to venous stasis from lymphatic obstruction
   and malignancy. IVC filter placed due to extensive clot burden and
   limitations in anticoagulation given recent hematemesis and
   thrombocytopenia.
   - stop heparin given thrombocytopenia and initiation of chemotherapy
   that will drop platelet count even lower and patient preference to
   minimize transfusions.
   .
   #) LLE swelling and weakness - initially concern for phlegmasia cerulea
   dolens due to lymph node obstruction of venous circulation.  CKs q8hr
   remained reassuringly non-elevated at 40 and 40. Symptoms now seem to
   be more likely related to extrinsic compression of vasculature and
   nerves from tumor burden and not compartment syndrome.  Decadron
   initiated.  Appreciate Vascular and Neurology recs.
   - f/u vascular recs
   - MRI LS plexus per neuro for further evaluation of tumor involvement.
   - consider stopping decadron as patient is now getting prednisone with
   chemotherapy.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: noted in the ED, although patient has no history of GI
   bleeding previously. Thought to be due to potential gastric varices
   from lymphatic obstruction as well as thrombocytopenia. Hct dropped
   from 40.4 (ED) --> 36.7 (MICU). Treated with pantoprazole drip
   initially. Patient refused NGT and lavage. GI consulted and following,
   planned to scope but patient refused so no intervention for now.
   - PPI IV BID per GI recs
   - 2 Large bore PIVs
   - maintain active T&S (2 units reserved currently)
   - advance diet
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Rising ALT 49 --> 85, AST 100 --> 137, Alk phos 137
   --> 141. With LDH 4315. Concerning for hepatic ischemia related to
   lymphoma.
   - trend
   - RUQ ultrasound in am
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated at 20 on admission.  Considered reactive
   process [**3-4**] DVT with thrombus vs infectious etiology (unclear source,
   afebrile) vs. malignancy. CXR clear.  UA and culture pending.  Most
   likely secondary to maliginancy.
   - f/u UA & culture
   - trend WBC count
   - follow temperature
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Anion gap of 15 with elevated lactate
   of 2.4 earlier today. Gap down from 18 earlier today.  Concern for
   tumor lysis syndrome vs. tissue ischemia from tumor.
   - chemotherapy as above
   - trend tumor lysis labs Q6H
   - repeat lactate at midnight
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  New in recent weeks and noted on OSH admission.
   Likely secondary to lymphoma.
   - trend
   - maintain plt > 10 if not bleeding, >50 if bleeding
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2 - holding oral agents.  Likely exacerbated
   by decadron.
   - HISS
   .
   # Hematuria: Noted previously by patient.  Likely [**3-4**] thrombocytopenia
   and exacerbated by heparin gtt. Foley in place
   - monitor, may need bladder irrigation if urine output slows.
   .
   # HTN: Hold Lisinopril in setting of potentially unstable blood
   volume.
   .
   # Anxiety / Depression: A very active issue per patient and now with
   new diagnosis of malignancy.
   - Continue Risperidone
   - SW for coping

   FEN: D5+150mEQ NaHCO3, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, bowel regimen, IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC line requested
   .
   Code: Full code currently, discussed with patient.  After extensive
   discussion patient is also agreable to blood transfusions and
   understands that he will almost certainly need some as a result of the
   chemotherapy.

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, and nephrolithiasis. He was recently diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and is currently in the ICU for tertiary care. The patient underwent an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement due to extensive clot burden and limitations in anticoagulation. He also has lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient's symptoms, including pain and swelling in the left lower extremity, are likely related to extrinsic compression of vasculature and nerves from the tumor burden rather than compartment syndrome. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and anion gap metabolic acidosis, which raises concern for tumor lysis syndrome. This condition can lead to renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Hepatic Ischemia: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), suggesting possible hepatic ischemia related to lymphoma. Close monitoring of liver enzymes is necessary.
3. Hematemesis: The patient experienced hematemesis in the emergency department, potentially due to gastric varices caused by lymphatic obstruction or thrombocytopenia. Pantoprazole drip has"

   Chief Complaint: LLE pain/swelling, new diagnosis of DLBCL
   24 Hour Events:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 13803**] is a 67 year old male with a history of DM2, OSA, and
   nephrolithiasis who was recently seen at [**Hospital 358**] hospital for LLE pain
   and swelling, diagnosed with DLBCL, and transfered to [**Hospital1 19**] early this
   morning for tertiary care.  Please see MICU-[**Location (un) **] admission note.
   .
   Over the course of today the patient had an IVC filter placed by
   vascular surgery.  Neurology recommended MR head, spine, and LS plexus
   with and without gad to further evaluate extent of disease.  LLE
   symptoms are felt to be secondary to extrinsic compression by the tumor
   in the pelvis rather than compartment syndrome.  Patient had no further
   emesis and remained on heparin gtt.  GI requested NG lavage which
   patient declined.  Pathology reviewed OSH slides and confirmed
   diagnosis.  Heme-Onc evaluated patient and recommended starting
   chemotherapy with CHOP this evening which is why the patient is being
   transfered from MICU-[**Location (un) 144**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].  He has already been started
   on decadron.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, the patient was comfortable, but overwhelmed by
   the events of the day.  He denied any current shortness of breath
   though he has had increasing shortness of breath with activity over the
   last couple of months.  He additional denied current chest pain,
   palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain, or LLE pain.  He does have pain
   in his left hip with movement.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is a group of metabolic complications that can occur after the treatment of cancer, particularly hematologic malignancies like lymphoma. It is characterized by the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream, leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and renal failure. The patient's elevated LDH level and anion gap metabolic acidosis suggest a concern for TLS.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a left lower extremity DVT. This is a serious condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs. If the clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs, it can cause a potentially life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism.

3. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient has experienced episodes of coffee ground emesis and hematuria, which may indicate gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding. The use of anticoagulant therapy, such as heparin, can increase the risk of bleeding.

4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) may suggest an underlying infection. However, the absence of fever and clear chest x-ray make this less likely. The patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy increases the risk of infections"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a new diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He presented with left leg swelling and was found to have a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted to the ICU for initiation of chemotherapy and management of his DVT. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, leukocytosis, anion gap metabolic acidosis, anxiety/depression, and a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur after the initiation of cancer treatment, particularly with chemotherapy. The patient's elevated LDH levels and high white blood cell count suggest the possibility of TLS. Close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is necessary to prevent renal failure.

2. Hepatic Ischemia: The patient's rising liver enzymes may indicate hepatic ischemia related to his lymphoma. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

3. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has already experienced a DVT and has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. There is a risk of further thrombotic events, and ongoing anticoagulation is required.

4. Infection: Despite being afebrile, the patient has leukocytosis,"

   popliteal and calf veins was performed. There is normal flow,
   compressibility and augmentation of the right lower extremity veins.
   There is complete occlusive thrombus in the left deep venous system
   with extension into the most superiorly visualized portion of the
   common femoral vein. Extension of clot into the common iliac vessels is
   not assessed on this study. There are large inguinal lymph nodes
   bilaterally measuring 3.4 x 1.5 on the right and 2.3 x 2.8 x 1.7 on the
   left.
   IMPRESSION: Occlusive thrombus in the left deep venous system extending

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a new diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He was admitted to the ICU for initiation of chemotherapy and is currently receiving treatment with CHOP. The patient has several medical complications, including left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), leukocytosis, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's elevated LDH levels and anion gap metabolic acidosis raise concerns for tumor lysis syndrome. Close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and uric acid levels is essential.
2. Hepatic Ischemia: The rising LFTs and concern for hepatic ischemia related to lymphoma need further evaluation. Trending liver enzymes and assessing for any signs of hepatic dysfunction are important.
3. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a confirmed left lower extremity DVT and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed due to extensive clot burden and limitations in anticoagulation. Continuous monitoring of the patient's coagulation status and consideration of anticoagulation therapy are necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a new diagnosis of B cell lymphoma admitted to the ICU for initiation of chemotherapy. The patient presented with left lower extremity swelling and was found to have a complete occlusive thrombus in the left deep venous system extending to the most superiorly visualized portion of the common femoral vein. The patient also has bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Other findings include normal left atrium size, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses, and normal left ventricular cavity size on TTE. The patient's right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal, and the aortic and mitral valves appear structurally normal. There is no pericardial effusion. CT head showed no acute intracranial abnormality. The patient is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of DVT with a complete occlusive thrombus in the left deep venous system. This condition can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a new diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He presented with left lower extremity (LLE) swelling, which was initially thought to be due to phlegmasia cerulea dolens but is now believed to be caused by extrinsic compression of the vasculature and nerves from the tumor burden. The patient received his first dose of CHOP chemotherapy last night and has ongoing concerns for tumor lysis syndrome, hepatic ischemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. He also has a left deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed due to extensive clot burden and limitations in anticoagulation. The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to malignancy, and he has an anion gap metabolic acidosis that may be related to tumor lysis syndrome or tissue ischemia. His diabetes mellitus type 2 is exacerbated by steroids, and he has hematuria that is likely due to thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient is anxious and depressed about his new diagnosis of malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), leukocytosis, and anion gap metabolic acidosis, which raises concern"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 13804**] is a 67 yo M with newly diagnosed DLBCL with tumor burden
   compressing vasculature and nerves to LLE causing LLE edema, pain and
   swelling, also noted to have a LLE DVT, thrombocytopenia and anemia.
   .
   #) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Received first dose of CHOP last
   night. HIV and Hepatitis titers sent, Bedside TTE performed this
   evening with good EF per cardiologist (final read pending).  Concern
   for potential tumor lysis with elevated LDH.
   - f/u serologies
   - R-CHOP therapy per BMT recs
   - Q6H tumor lysis labs (Ca of 6.5 repleted at MN)
   - hydration with NaHCO3; good UOP, could consider switch to NS.
   - Continue preventative allopurinol to decrease risk of nephropathy
   - MR head and spine with and without gad to evaluate for CNS
   involvement on Monday (ordered)
   .
   #) LLE DVT - felt secondary to venous stasis from lymphatic obstruction
   and malignancy. IVC filter placed due to extensive clot burden and
   limitations in anticoagulation given recent hematemesis and
   thrombocytopenia.  PLTs 69, HCT 27.9.
   -  Original plan was to cont. heparin gtt, and stop if plt < 50, HCT <
   30.  With HCT of 27.9, will continue to monitor pt on heparin gtt and
   consider stopping if PLTs drop below 50.
   - monitor HCT, plts [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #) LLE swelling and weakness - initially concern for phlegmasia cerulea
   dolens due to lymph node obstruction of venous circulation.  CKs q8hr
   remained reassuringly non-elevated at 40 and 40. Symptoms now seem to
   be more likely related to extrinsic compression of vasculature and
   nerves from tumor burden and not compartment syndrome.  Decadron given
   initially, now pt on prednisone per R-CHOP regimen.  Appreciate
   Vascular and Neurology recs.
   - f/u vascular recs
   - MRI LS plexus per neuro for evaluation of tumor
   involvement/compression of nerves Monday.
   - continue prednisone with chemotherapy.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient had episode of coffee ground emesis in the ED,
   although patient has no history of GI bleeding previously. Thought to
   be due to potential gastric varices from lymphatic obstruction as well
   as thrombocytopenia. Hct dropped from 40.4 (ED) --> 36.7 (MICU)
 27.9
   (now). Now on pantoprazole IV bid. Patient refused NGT and lavage and
   EGD.  GI following for now.
   - PPI IV BID per GI recs
   - 2 Large bore PIVs
   - maintain active T&S (2 units reserved currently)
   - advanced diet, doing well
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Rising ALT 49 --> 85
 99, AST 100 --> 137
 142, Alk
   phos 137 --> 141
 123. With LDH 4315. Concerning for hepatic ischemia
   related to lymphoma. No portal vein thrombosis per yesterday
s CT. LFTs
   trending down today except LDH which is elevated at 7375, likely
   secondary to tumor lysis .
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - F/u hepatitis serologies
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated at 20 on admission, now 25.5.  Initially
   considered reactive process [**3-4**] DVT with thrombus vs infectious
   etiology vs. malignancy. CXR clear.  UA and culture c/w enterococcal
   UTI. Patient does report one day of hematuria and dysuria prior to
   presenting to hospital.
   - Started nitrofuratoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 7**] x 10 days (day 1 = [**2127-4-6**]) for
   complicated (male) UTI as patient had persistent leukocytosis, low
   grade temps, and tachycardia.  Tailor antibiotics based on final
   sensitivities, and if patient noted to have ARF/TLS, consider switching
   to another antibiotic as macrobid can contribute to renal impairment.
   - trend WBC count
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Gap down 18 -> 14 -> 16 today.  Concern
   for tumor lysis syndrome vs. tissue ischemia from tumor.  Repeat
   lactate yesterday 1.9.
   - chemotherapy as above
   - trend tumor lysis labs Q6H
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  New in recent weeks and noted on OSH admission.
   Likely secondary to lymphoma.
   - trend, 69 today.
   - maintain plt > 10 if not bleeding, >50 if bleeding
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2 - holding oral agents.  Likely exacerbated
   by decadron and prednisone.
   - HISS
   .
   # Hematuria: Noted previously by patient.  Likely [**3-4**] thrombocytopenia,
   UTI, and exacerbated by heparin gtt. Foley in place
   - monitor, may need bladder irrigation if urine output slows.
   .
   # HTN: Continue to hold Lisinopril in setting of potentially unstable
   blood volume with decreasing HCT/PLTs and hep gtt. SBPs have been in
   110s.
   .
   # Anxiety / Depression: A very active issue per patient and now with
   new diagnosis of malignancy.
   - Continue Risperidone
   - SW for coping
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 today from 138 yesterday. Likely secondary to
   sodium bicarb infusions vs. decreased po intake of free water.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring during the initiation of chemotherapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, blood pressure of 116/58 mmHg, heart rate of 94 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2 liters of oxygen. Physical examination reveals swelling and erythema in the left lower extremity, which is tender to touch. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 25.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 69 K/uL, and an elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. The patient has been started on heparin gtt for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and risperidone for anxiety/depression. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the medical floor soon. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): The patient's elevated LDH level and recent chemotherapy treatment increase the risk of TLS. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and urine output is necessary.
2. Enterococcal Urinary Tract"

   -  Original plan was to cont. heparin gtt, and stop if plt < 50, HCT <
   30.  With HCT of 27.9, will continue to monitor pt on heparin gtt and
   consider stopping if PLTs drop below 50.
   - monitor HCT, plts [**Hospital1 **]

   #) LLE swelling and weakness - initially concern for phlegmasia cerulea
   dolens due to lymph node obstruction of venous circulation.  CKs q8hr
   remained reassuringly non-elevated at 40 and 40. Symptoms now seem to
   be more likely related to extrinsic compression of vasculature and
   nerves from tumor burden and not compartment syndrome.  Decadron given
   initially, now pt on prednisone per R-CHOP regimen.  Appreciate
   Vascular and Neurology recs.
   - f/u vascular recs
   - MRI LS plexus per neuro for evaluation of tumor
   involvement/compression of nerves Monday.
   - continue prednisone with chemotherapy.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient had episode of coffee ground emesis in the ED,
   although patient has no history of GI bleeding previously. Thought to
   be due to potential gastric varices from lymphatic obstruction as well
   as thrombocytopenia. Hct dropped from 40.4 (ED) --> 36.7 (MICU)
 27.9
   (now). Now on pantoprazole IV bid. Patient refused NGT and lavage and
   EGD.  GI following for now.
   - PPI IV BID per GI recs
   - 2 Large bore PIVs
   - maintain active T&S (2 units reserved currently)
   - advanced diet, doing well

 99, AST 100 --> 137
 142, Alk
   phos 137 --> 141
 123. With LDH 4315. Concerning for hepatic ischemia
   related to lymphoma. No portal vein thrombosis per yesterday
s CT. LFTs
   trending down today except LDH which is elevated at 7375, likely
   secondary to tumor lysis .
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - F/u hepatitis serologies
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated at 20 on admission, now 25.5.  Initially
   considered reactive process [**3-4**] DVT with thrombus vs infectious
   etiology vs. malignancy. CXR clear.  UA and culture c/w enterococcal
   UTI. Patient does report one day of hematuria and dysuria prior to
   presenting to hospital.
   - Started nitrofuratoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 7**] x 10 days (day 1 = [**2127-4-6**]) for
   complicated (male) UTI as patient had persistent leukocytosis, low
   grade temps, and tachycardia.  Tailor antibiotics based on final
   sensitivities, and if patient noted to have ARF/TLS, consider switching
   to another antibiotic as macrobid can contribute to renal impairment.
   - trend WBC count
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Gap down 18 -> 14 -> 16 today.  Concern
   for tumor lysis syndrome vs. tissue ischemia from tumor.  Repeat
   lactate yesterday 1.9.
   - chemotherapy as above
   - trend tumor lysis labs Q6H
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  New in recent weeks and noted on OSH admission.
   Likely secondary to lymphoma.
   - trend, 69 today.
   - maintain plt > 10 if not bleeding, >50 if bleeding
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2 - holding oral agents.  Likely exacerbated
   by decadron and prednisone.
   - HISS
   .
   # Hematuria: Noted previously by patient.  Likely [**3-4**] thrombocytopenia,
   UTI, and exacerbated by heparin gtt. Foley in place
   - monitor, may need bladder irrigation if urine output slows.
   .
   # HTN: Continue to hold Lisinopril in setting of potentially unstable
   blood volume with decreasing HCT/PLTs and hep gtt. SBPs have been in
   110s.
   .
   # Anxiety / Depression: A very active issue per patient and now with
   new diagnosis of malignancy.
   - Continue Risperidone
   - SW for coping
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 today from 138 yesterday. Likely secondary to
   sodium bicarb infusions vs. decreased po intake of free water.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a new diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He received his first dose of R-CHOP chemotherapy last night and is currently in the ICU for close monitoring. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and a urinary tract infection (UTI). He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): The patient has elevated levels of LDH and uric acid, which are concerning for TLS. Monitoring of tumor lysis labs every 6 hours and maintaining hydration with sodium bicarbonate are recommended.
2. Enterococcal UTI: The patient has a significant growth of Enterococcus sp. in the urine culture. He is currently being treated with nitrofurantoin, but if he develops acute renal failure or tumor lysis syndrome, the antibiotic should be switched due to the risk of renal impairment.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely secondary to his lymphoma. Close monitoring of platelet count is essential, and platelet transfusion should be considered if the patient is bleeding or if the platelet count drops below 10,000/mm3.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and rigors after receiving a dose of Rituxan infusion. The patient has been diagnosed with Enterococcus urinary tract infection and started on nitrofurantoin. He is currently receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy for his underlying condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has shown signs of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with decreased urine output and elevated lactate levels. TLS concerns have been addressed by increasing hydration and adjusting electrolyte levels. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. His renal function is within normal limits. The patient remains on prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer medication, and has an indwelling urinary catheter. The patient's code status is DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is a potential complication in patients undergoing chemotherapy, particularly with agents like Rituxan. It occurs due to the rapid destruction of malignant cells, leading to the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. This can result in hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury. The patient's decreased urine output and elevated lactate levels indicate ongoing TLS concerns, which need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):"
