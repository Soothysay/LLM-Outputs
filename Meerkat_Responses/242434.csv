","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of mitral valve replacement, thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA), atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was initially admitted for concern about TAA dissection and then transferred to Medicine surgery for multifocal pneumonia and acute renal failure (ARF), which has since resolved. The patient is now in the MICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring due to a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed:

1. Abdominal Wall Hematoma: A CT scan revealed a left abdominal wall intramuscular hematoma with two small foci of active extravasation. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level has dropped from 26 to 24 prior to transfer. Her heart rate is now in the range of 110-130 beats per minute with stable blood pressures. The plan includes active tracking and monitoring of vital signs and hematocrit levels. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) overnight. She has two large bore intravenous (IV) lines, IV fluid bolus for resuscitation, and is being monitored for changes in the abdominal exam. A follow-up final CT read is also recommended. Vascular surgery input is appreciated, focusing on monitoring Hcts, vitals, and pressure dressing. Consideration should be given to reversing the international normalized"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was initially admitted for concern about TAA dissection, then transferred to Medicine surgery for multifocal pneumonia and acute renal failure (resolved), and now in the MICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring given spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Wall Hematoma: The patient has a large intramuscular hematoma with active extravasation. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and abdominal exam is necessary. Vascular surgery input is appreciated for further management.

2. Abdominal Distension: Although the patient reports improvement in distension and passing gas, CT shows distended large bowel loops without obstruction. Genitourinary involvement is appreciated, and measures such as placing a nasogastric tube for decompression, continuing bowel regimen, and monitoring abdominal exam should be continued.

3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia seen on CXR, likely related to aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Oxygen therapy should be titrated for target saturations of 88-92% considering her COPD history. A 14-day course of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl should be administered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, thoracic aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was transferred to the ICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring due to spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, acute renal failure (resolved), and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal wall hematoma: The patient has a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma, which is a concerning finding. Given the active extravasation seen on CT, there is a risk of further bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and appropriate consultation with vascular surgery and interventional radiology are necessary.
2. Abdominal distension: The patient is experiencing abdominal distension, which may be due to bowel obstruction or constipation. Immediate steps should be taken to relieve the distension, such as manual disimpaction and trial of enemas. Consultation with gastroenterology is also recommended.
3. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, likely hospital-acquired given her poor pulmonary reserve from COPD. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated, and close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is important.
4. Mechanical mitral valve: The patient has a mechanical mitral valve, and proper anticoagulation management is crucial. Regular monitoring of INR levels and consultation with card"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, thoracoabdominal aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was admitted for concern about TAA dissection, then transferred to Medicine surgery for multifocal pneumonia and acute renal failure (resolved). She is now in the MICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring due to a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Wall Hematoma: The patient has a large intramuscular hematoma in the left abdominal wall with active extravasation. This condition requires close monitoring, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further bleeding.
2. Abdominal Distension/Constipation/Ileus: The patient is experiencing abdominal distension and constipation/ileus. Aggressive bowel regimen, enemas, and manual disimpaction have been attempted without success. Further evaluation by surgery and GI consult is recommended.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient continues to be stable on 2L NC with ongoing antibiotics. Vancomycin will be discontinued. The patient should continue with Advair and hold Spiriva. Nebulizers will be provided as needed, and sputum cultures will be repeated.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with an increased dose of digoxin. Diltiazem will be stopped since"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve, thoracic aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was initially admitted for concern about TAA dissection and underwent cardiac surgery on 05/25/2147. She was then transferred to Medicine surgery for multifocal pneumonia and acute renal failure (ARF), which has since resolved. The patient is now in the MICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring due to a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Abdominal Wall Hematoma: A CT scan revealed a left abdominal wall intramuscular hematoma with two small foci of active extravasation. The plan includes monitoring the patient's hematocrit (hct) every six hours, placing two large bore IVs, performing a type and screen, and administering two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's left flank should be monitored, and if she is hemodynamically unstable, the reverse INR should be considered.

2. Abdominal Distension: The patient reports that her distension has improved, and she is experiencing flatus. The plan is to begin enemas, initiate an aggressive bowel regimen, consult with surgery for recommendations, keep the patient NPO (nothing by mouth), and replete electrolytes as needed.

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, thoracic aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was initially admitted for concern about TAA dissection and then transferred to Medicine surgery for multifocal pneumonia and acute renal failure, which has since resolved. She is now in the MICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring due to a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Abdominal Wall Hematoma: The patient has a large intramuscular hematoma in her left abdominal wall with active extravasation. This requires close monitoring, and appropriate measures such as trend hct q6hrs, large bore IVs, and reverse INR if hemodynamically unstable need to be taken.

2. Abdominal Distension: The patient reports feeling better with reduced distension and is having flatus. Therefore, it is recommended to begin enemas, aggressive bowel regimen, follow-up surgery recommendations, keep her NPO for now, and replete lytes as needed.

3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is being managed with antibiotics, and she should continue the abx and follow clinically. She should also continue on Advair, hold Spiriva, use albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing, and use albuterol PRN. A follow"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, thoracic aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the hospital for multifocal pneumonia and acute renal failure (ARF), and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Abdominal wall hematoma: The patient has an intramuscular hematoma in the left abdominal wall with active extravasation, as shown on a recent CT scan. This requires close monitoring of vital signs and hematocrit levels. The patient is on Coumadin for her mechanical mitral valve, which may contribute to the bleeding. Vascular surgery input is appreciated, and the patient should be monitored for any signs of worsening bleeding or hematoma expansion.

2. Abdominal distension: The patient reports feeling distended, but is passing gas. A CT scan reveals distended large bowel loops without obstruction. This suggests a possible bowel motility issue. Manual disimpaction and trial enemas may be beneficial in relieving the distension. Collaboration with a gastroenterologist or general surgeon would be helpful in managing this condition.

3. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has poor pulmonary reserve due to her COPD, making her more susceptible to respiratory infections. She"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including MVR, TAA, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring due to a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma.

The patient's current assessment includes several issues:
1. Abdominal wall hematoma/anemia: The patient has a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma, which is being monitored with frequent Hcts (hematocrit) checks. The patient is also receiving active treatment and monitoring.
2. Abdominal distension/ileus/constipation: Despite NG tube placement and intermittent wall suction, there has been no significant improvement. The patient is being referred to GI for colonoscopic decompression as conservative therapy has not worked. The NG tube will continue for decompression, and the bowel regimen will be continued.
3. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia seen on CXR. She has poor pulmonary reserve due to COPD. The treatment plan includes titrating oxygen for target saturations of 88-92%, along with a 14-day course of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Advair will be continued, while spiriva will be held. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers will be used as needed.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's digoxin level on 5/25"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, thoracic aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring due to spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, abdominal distension with ileus, and hyponatremia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has several medical complications that require close monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Wall Hematoma: The patient has a spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma, which can potentially lead to further bleeding or infection if not properly managed.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Abdominal Distension and Ileus: The patient's abdominal distension and ileus may progress to bowel ischemia or perforation if not effectively managed.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia needs to be corrected carefully to avoid complications such as seizures or neurological dysfunction.
5. Mechanical Mitral Valve: The patient requires close monitoring of her anticoagulation therapy to maintain the target INR range and prevent thromboembolic events.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of mitral valve replacement, thoracic aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring due to spontaneous abdominal wall hematoma. The patient's current condition includes abdominal distension/ileus, multifocal pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, hyponatremia, and a mechanical mitral valve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension/ileus: The patient is experiencing ongoing abdominal distension and ileus despite NG tube placement. Conservative therapy has not improved her condition. There is a possibility of complications such as bowel perforation or necrosis if the ileus persists or worsens.

2. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia on top of pre-existing multifocal pneumonia. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential complications like sepsis or respiratory failure.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. If not managed properly, it can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia. If not corrected, this can cause neurological symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications.

5. Mechanical mitral valve: The patient has a mechanical mitral valve requiring lifelong anticoag"
