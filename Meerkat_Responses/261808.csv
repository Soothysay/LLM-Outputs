   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  Other than liver disease and toxins/meds,
   differential can also include myxedema coma (can also cause elevated
   ammonia) and had abnormal TFTs at OSH, though these were attributed to
   sick euthyroid.
   - Check tox panels.
   - Repeat ammonia here.
   - Repeat liver US and LFTs.
   - Check valproate level (?overdose/ingestion).
   - Thyroid workup as below.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - Check valproate as above.
   - Endocrine workup.
   - Hepatology consult in AM.
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   - Continue lactulose for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Consider re-tap of pleural effusions.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but
   has received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently
   within normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).
   Does have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement.
   - Place heparin free line.
   - Likely can safely restart given negative recent PF4; another one
   resent here.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS here.
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT.
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia.
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI
   # Access: RIJ from OSH; replace with new CVL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for dyspnea on exertion, worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. The patient's condition has deteriorated during the hospital course, with the development of severe encephalopathy. The main concerns at this time are encephalopathy, respiratory failure, hyperammonemia, septic shock/hypotension, possible hypothyroidism, rash, anasarca, acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status has declined significantly, and he is currently minimally responsive. Elevated ammonia levels are concerning, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated primarily for airway protection. He has significant abnormalities on chest CT, including multiple areas of infiltrate, right upper lobe consolidation, and bilateral effusions. Plans to liberate from the ventilator are pending improvement in mental status.

3. Hyperammonemia: The patient's ammonia levels are consistently high, which is unexpected without clear liver disease"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), laryngeal and bladder cancer, and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented with shortness of breath on exertion and was admitted to the hospital. He developed respiratory failure and encephalopathy, leading to transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's current condition includes severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, hyperammonemia, septic shock/hypotension, potential hypothyroidism, desquamative rash, anasarca, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent PE/DVT.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require careful management in the ICU. The potential medical complications include encephalopathy, respiratory failure, sepsis, hypothyroidism, anasarca, renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, and diabetes mellitus.

It is crucial to closely monitor and manage the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, electrolytes, renal function, respiratory status, and nutritional support. The healthcare team should also consider the patient's code status, infection control measures, and communication with the family.

Overall, this patient requires a multidisciplinary approach with involvement from critical care medicine, nephrology, endocrin"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. Hyperammonemia may be
   contributing to component of hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
   dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal
   thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less
   likely at this time. Would also consider seizure and infectious
   encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Consider extubate despite poor mental status
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - No sedation
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily SBT
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Concern for
   sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No documented
   new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed currently
   off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body).
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficit
   aggressively as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal involvement
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban

   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted for dyspnea on exertion and worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. He is now in the ICU with severe encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing severe encephalopathy, which can have various causes such as hypotension (anoxic brain injury), hyperammonemia, hepatic dysfunction, seizure, infectious encephalitis, or myxedema coma.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to airway protection, and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to intubation. There are recommendations for extubation, weaning from mechanical ventilation, and implementing VAP bundle.
3. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient had hypotension, which is now improved. There are concerns about sepsis versus volume depletion. Levophed was used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, and cultures including PICC tip are pending.
4. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash, particularly over the extremities. It is not mucosal and is less likely to be drug-related or TEN. It may be related to anasarca and changing volume status. Dermatology recommendations"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. Hyperammonemia may be
   contributing to component of hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
   dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal
   thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less
   likely at this time. Would also consider seizure and infectious
   encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Consider extubate despite poor mental status
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - No sedation
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily SBT
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Concern for
   sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No documented
   new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed currently
   off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body).
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficit
   aggressively as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal involvement
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal involvement
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. He has now been transferred to a different hospital with severe encephalopathy.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing severe encephalopathy with a wide differential diagnosis. Possible causes include hypotension, anoxic brain injury, hyperammonemia, hepatic dysfunction, seizure, infectious encephalitis, and valproic acid toxicity.
   - Recommendation: Follow neurology recommendations, continue 24-hour EEG, consider MRI/LP if the patient does not improve.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to potential respiratory failure, although there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to intubation.
   - Recommendation: Consider extubation despite poor mental status, wean vent as tolerated, no sedation, VAP bundle, daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).
3. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock/hypotension. Levophed is currently off, and there is concern for sepsis versus volume depletion. No new infections have"

   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion and has since developed worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. He is currently in the ICU with severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, rash, septic shock/hypotension, hyperammonemia, hypothyroidism, anasarca, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, recent PE/DVT, and history of C. Diff colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's severe encephalopathy requires close monitoring and management. Immediate steps include following neurology recommendations, continuing the 24-hour EEG, and considering an MRI/LP if the patient does not improve.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitates ongoing ventilatory support and careful monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters. Unlikely candidate for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) or extubation at this time due to diffuse encephalopathy.
3. Rash: The patient presents with desquamative rash, particularly over extremities. Dermatology recommendations should be followed, including avoiding denuding more skin, using Aquacel AG and Silvadene, and considering burn care consult pending"

   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  - Thyroid workup as below. Most likely
   hypoxic/hypotensive brain/kidney/liver injury
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
    - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
    - Check valproate as above.
    Head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   -Continue lactulose for now.
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  Endocrine
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Ask Briham Burn Unit for rec's on care
   # Anasarca.  Mild diffuse anasarca, small pericardial effusion,
   ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has received IV albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently within normal limits (mild
   diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does have CKD. Acute liver
   disease, Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension, prerenal/overdiuresis,
   elevated vanc levels, other process.
    # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement
   _On Argatroban
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   # DM.
    - ISS here.
   # Recent PE/DVT.
    Argatroban because of HIT
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
    - Precautions.
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated during his hospital course, leading to severe encephalopathy. He is currently unresponsive and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing severe encephalopathy with very elevated ammonia levels. No known liver disease prior to this admission, and no other medications that can be immediately implicated. Depression is suspected, but family strongly doubts other ingestions. 
- Continue lactulose for now.
- Head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated primarily for airway protection. He has significant abnormalities on chest CT, including multiple areas of infiltrate, right upper lobe consolidation versus mass, and bilateral effusions. With worsening mental status, there are no plans to liberate from the ventilator yet.
- Continue on AC settings.
- No sedation.
- VAP bundle.
- Consider A-line for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.

3. Hyperammonemia: The patient has ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at the previous hospital. This is an unexpected finding"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # DM.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's progress note indicates multiple medical complications and ongoing assessments. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy with abnormal thyroid function, high ammonia levels, and EEG findings consistent with anoxic injury. There is a wide differential diagnosis for encephalopathy, including hypotension, hepatic dysfunction, and other possible etiologies. The prognosis is very poor at this stage.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated primarily for airway protection. There is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to intubation. The large tidal volumes and low respiratory rate are likely secondary to a central cause. The patient is unlikely to be a candidate for spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) or extubation at this time due to diffuse encephalopathy.

3. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash, particularly over the extremities, without mucosal lesions. Dermatology has evaluated the rash to rule out Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). The rash is more likely related to anasarca and changing volume status rather than an inflammatory drug reaction. Nursing staff are concerned about the care of the skin denudation. 

4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient's hypotension is currently improved, but previous concerns included sepsis versus volume"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.

   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Family Meeting to discuss code status and goals of care.
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Will hold on plastics input at this time.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas

   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP

   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   sick euthyroid.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W to replete free water deficit of 4.4 L.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He presented with dyspnea on exertion, worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. He is now in the ICU with severe encephalopathy. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy with wide differentials. Reports of hypotension previously can indicate a component of anoxic brain injury. However, the duration of hypotension is relatively short. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to hepatic encephalopathy, but ammonia levels were high before the major decline in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. An abnormal thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less likely given thyroid function that looks like sick euthyroid. The EEG is concerning for anoxic brain injury. The prognosis is very poor at this stage.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated primarily for airway protection, and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal volumes, low respiratory rate are most likely secondary to central etiology. The patient is unlikely to be a candidate for spontaneous breathing"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.

   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline.
- The patient's condition has deteriorated, with severe encephalopathy, rash, septic shock/hypotension, hyperammonemia, hypothyroidism, anasarca, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, recent PE/DVT, and a history of Clostridium difficile colitis.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, Plt, Cr, and electrolyte imbalances.
- Imaging studies reveal subcortical white matter hypodensities, mucosal thickening, fluid in the paranasal sinuses, and opacification of mastoid air cells.
- The patient has multiple ongoing assessments and plans, including follow-up with neurology, dermatology, endocrinology, hepatology, and respiratory consults. He also requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for his various conditions.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. The patient has been transferred to the ICU due to severe encephalopathy. He has multiple organ failures, hypoalbunemia, poor neurologic function, and a grim prognosis.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, liver function abnormalities, and chronic renal failure. Other potential complications mentioned in the note are septic shock/hypotension, hypothyroidism, rash, hypoalbunemia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, and C. difficile colitis.

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and has a high ventilatory support level due to metabolic acidosis and possibly central causes. He remains hyperammonemic, hypotensive, and has desquamative skin lesions. The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and there is a concern for either iatrogenic causes or diabetes insipidus. There is also an ongoing large metabolic acidosis.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU. The attending physician believes that the patient's prognosis is poor and does"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Re-image depending on Neurology advice
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a sub-acute decline in mental status and anasarca. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath on [**2170-2-2**] and was found to have an elevated ammonia level of 223. He was slurring speech and somewhat somnolent at that time. The patient spent 10 days on the floor and then was transferred to the ICU, where he was intubated and started on pressors. He became unresponsive during this time, and his desquamative skin and comatose state prompted his transfer to another hospital.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, desquamating skin, and seizures. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 80 bpm, blood pressure 85/51 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 insp/min, and oxygen saturation 99%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 10, peak inspiratory pressure 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen 40%, and positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of glucose (207 mg/dL), ammonia (62 K/uL), sodium (143 mEq/L), and creatinine (3.6 mg/dL). His WBC count is slightly elevated at 11.9 K/uL, while his platelet count is within the normal range at 60 K/uL. Other lab results, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits or show only mild abnormalities.

Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of his altered mental status, further episodes of seizures, and complications related to his desquamating skin. The underlying cause of his symptoms and desquamating skin reaction is unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine the etiology. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, neurological status, and laboratory parameters will be crucial in managing his condition and preventing any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia if possible
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Do not re-image for now
 unlikely helpful
   # Adventitious head movements
   Several muscle groups
 therefore cortical. Suggestive of seizure
   activity. Secondary to anoxic injury with some sparing of motorneurons
   versus edema and mass effect.
   - Dilantin 1 g then check in 4 hrs; 100 mg TID after
   - Imaging not indicated at the moment.
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening. Not
   likely [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] Derm., who think that this is most likely secondary to
   previously dramatic anasarca and then microtrauma of being in bed.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics (started for
   pneumonia/sepsis/C.diff) given unable to apply antimicrobial
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes
   - Appreciate Dermatology input
   - Treat as for burn
 copious fluids that respect hypernatremia and low
   bicarbonate
   # Respiratory Failure
   Agonal brainstem breathing, +/- liver breathing. Appears brainstem also
   affected based on reflexes/exam, thus likely neurologic. Also
   contributions by expansion acidosis.
   - Continue AC ventilation compatible with central rhythm
   # Goals of Care
   - Family meeting at 3 p.m. today.
   # Hypotension
   Clear loss of spinal reflexes and pupils small suggesting sympathetic
   output likely lower at brainstem or spinal level.
   - Continue fluid support as indicated by urine output (fluid balance
   not accurate due to cutaneous losses)
   - Low threshold to use pressors to stabilize while determining goals of
   care
   # Hyperammonemia
   Unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] late to present with metabolic disorder, although not
   impossible. No valproic acid recently. Has liver failure and pancreatic
   calcification of unknown etiology. Family claim little to no alcohol
   use.
   - Repeat ammonia level today
   # ESR
   Was 0 in OSH. This means no settling over one hour. Should therefore be
   suspicious for inflammatory causes of this presentation.
   - Repeat ESR
   # Hypothyroidism
   Likely sick euthyroid.
   # Hypernatremia
   Corrected quite quickly
 concerning. 5 mEq over nine hours maximal
   rate from labs. Unlikely problem in itself, but may be edema from
   anoxic brain injury and the two together may become significant.
   - [**Hospital1 **] labs and caution with solutions that contain no sodium. 1/2NS
   likely okay because of hypotonic skin losses
   # Anasarca
   Liver failure, low albumin and renal failure, now with large fluid
   shift and protein losses through skin. Will likely worsen.
   # Renal failure
   Creatinine now lower, but not baseline (2.2) suggesting that we are
   keeping up with fluid requirement.
   -Continue fluids
   # Liver failure
   Unclear cause. Fatty changes suggested by ultrasound. [**Month (only) 11**] be cause of
   low albumin, low ceruloplasmin
   # Low ceruloplasmin
   (5) in OSH. Not low enough for [**Location (un) 1729**]
s and metabolism likely disturbed
   with liver failure. Acerulopasminemia or Menkes do not fit. Would not
   explain present event.
   # PE/DVT
   - Continue intermittent argatroban (lowest dose deliverable too high,
   so will need to try 3 hours on 3 hours off today (previous minimum dose
   halving should be good estimation as first step.
   # C. diff.
   In OSH. Therefore flagyl and precautions.
   # Antibiotics
   Started for PNA/sepsis and now likely providing broad coverage for open
   skin.
   - Continue for now.
   # DM
   Well controlled at present.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a sub-acute decline in mental status and anasarca. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have an elevated ammonia level. He was intubated and started on pressors due to hypotension. The patient became unresponsive and was transferred to another hospital with desquamative skin and comatose.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, adventitious head movements suggesting seizure activity, desquamating skin reaction, respiratory failure, hypotension, hyperammonemia, elevated ESR, hypothyroidism, hypernatremia, anasarca, renal failure, liver failure, and low ceruloplasmin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening of the altered mental status, further seizure activity, progression of the desquamating skin reaction, worsening respiratory failure, persistent hypotension, potential development of hepatic encephalopathy, worsening hypernatremia, worsening anasarca, progression of renal and liver failure, and the possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, neurologic status, fluid balance, and laboratory results to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, anasarca, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. The patient has multiple organ failures, including respiratory failure, encephalopathy, liver function abnormalities, and renal failure. He also has hypoalbuminemia, poor neurologic function, and seizures. The patient's prognosis is grim, and he has been intubated for airway protection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If not managed properly, this can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is very poor, and he is experiencing seizures. This indicates significant brain dysfunction. Without appropriate management, the encephalopathy may worsen, leading to increased neurological decline and potential brain damage.

3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, which may indicate liver dysfunction. If not addressed, this can lead to further liver damage and impact the patient's overall health status.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and there is acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency. Proper management of fluid balance and electrolytes is crucial to prevent further kidney damage and complications related to"
