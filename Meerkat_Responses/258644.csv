   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chest pain and elevated troponin levels, consistent with NSTEMI. He has been diagnosed with three vessel disease and is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the morning. The patient is currently free of chest pain.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/63 mmHg to 127/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on intravenous infusions of nitroglycerin and heparin.

Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, with clear lungs, supple neck, and no signs of pallor or cyanosis. The patient's cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line. There are no abnormal heart sounds or murmurs.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.0-10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 37.9-38.2 g/dL, platelet count of 174-186 K/uL, blood glucose level of 103-132 mg/dL, and troponin T levels of 0.37-0.65 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal ranges"

   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9683**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   53 yr old smoker transferred with chest pain and positive enzymes with
   nonSTEMI.
   Urgent cath showed 3 vessel CAD.  IABP placed for continued angina and
   CABG planned today.
   Painfree overnight.
   CK 1071.
   Physical Examination
   Groin site intact with good pulses.
   Medical Decision Making
   CABG later today.
   Continues on ASA, heparin, BB, statin.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man without significant past medical history who presented with chest pain and troponin elevation consistent with NSTEMI. He was found to have three vessel disease and is currently chest pain-free. The patient has been started on aspirin, heparin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy. Pain control and afterload reduction are being managed with nitroglycerin. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered for the morning, and the patient's condition will be trended for cardiac enzymes. If the patient's pain becomes uncontrollable, consideration will be given to an angioplasty. The patient is advised to quit smoking and has been prescribed a nicotine patch. Prophylactic measures include coverage for hepatitis, peptic ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be kept in the coronary care unit for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Restenosis or recurrent coronary artery disease after CABG.
2. Infection at the site of arterial or IABP line insertion.
3. Bleeding or hematoma due to anticoagulant therapy.
4. Myocardial infarction or unstable angina during the perioperative period.
5. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
6. Stroke or transient ischemic attack related to embolism or throm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chest pain, troponin elevation, and three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is currently being managed in the ICU. The patient is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery today. He is receiving various medications including aspirin, heparin, statin, beta-blocker, and nitroglycerin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 92/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, with slightly elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient has mild elevations in troponin T and CK-MB. Imaging studies reveal significant stenosis in the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and circumflex artery, along with an occluded omohyoid artery. The patient is advised to quit smoking and is being monitored for potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old man without significant past medical history who presents
   with chest pain and troponin elevation consistent with NSTEMI and found
   to have three vessel disease.
   # NSTEMI: 3VD with plan to undergo CABG today. Currenly chest pain
   free.
   - continue asa, heparin ggt, Statin, BB.
   - hold clopidrogel in am, pre-op
   - pain control and afterload reduction with nitro ggt (goal SBP in 90s)
   - 12.5 metoprolol q6h for heart rate of 60, nitro gtt for MAP of 60-80.
   - morphine prn, ativan for anxeity
   - TTE in am

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chest pain, troponin elevation, and three-vessel disease. He has been diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient is currently free of chest pain. The medical team has initiated appropriate medications for pain control, afterload reduction, and blood pressure management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 92/63 mmHg, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and three-vessel disease, indicating significant coronary artery disease. During CABG surgery, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.

2. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion, which increases the risk of bleeding. There is a possibility of bleeding at the arterial line insertion site or other invasive procedures performed in the ICU.

3. Infection complications: The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, which increases the risk of infection. Pneumonia or bloodstream infections could potentially develop if proper infection control measures are not maintained.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old man with a significant medical history of chest pain, troponin elevation, and three-vessel disease.
- He was admitted to the ICU due to ongoing chest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization.
- The patient has been started on an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) and various medications including nitroglycerin, heparin, morphine, and ativan.
- His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 92/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal heart rhythm and fluid balance.
- Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated troponin T level.
- The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed significant blockages in his coronary arteries, leading to the diagnosis of three-vessel disease.
- The plan is to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the morning.
- The patient is currently chest pain-free and will continue to receive various medications and treatments including statin, beta-blocker, and pain control with nitro gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:
