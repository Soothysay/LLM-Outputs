   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis
   SEPSIS -- severe, improved.  Source likely skin infection.  Plan
   continue supportive care.
   HYPOTENSION -- improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to skin infection (although unclear wether
   primary or secondary  such as endovascular infection).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.
   RIGHT LEG CELLULITIS -- antimirobials.  General surgery to follow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with sepsis and hypotension, requiring critical care in the ICU. The patient's condition improved over time, with vital signs stabilizing and right leg tenderness improving. The patient has a history of a skin infection, which is believed to be the source of the sepsis. The patient is now on antimicrobial therapy and receiving supportive care. Nutritional support is being provided through parenteral nutrition, and fluid balance is being closely monitored. The patient's blood cultures grew group B streptococcus, indicating bacterial infection. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormalities in kidney function tests. The patient's condition is still critical, but they are showing signs of improvement. Potential medical complications include worsening sepsis, hypotension, right leg cellulitis, and further development of kidney dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Although the patient's condition has improved, there is still a risk of worsening sepsis if the infection spreads or if the patient develops antibiotic resistance.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially had hypotension, which is low blood pressure. This can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications. Close monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis and hypotension. The patient has a history of being unable to provide history due to language barriers and is Spanish-speaking. 

The patient's recent events include an ultrasound performed on 08/21/2125 at 08:20 AM, blood cultures taken on 08/21/2125 at 09:30 AM and 03:38 PM, urine culture taken on 08/21/2125 at 09:30 AM, another ultrasound performed on 08/21/2125 at 01:02 PM, and an arterial line started on 08/21/2125 at 03:00 PM. 

The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) started on 08/21/2125 at 11:18 AM and ampicillin started on 08/22/2125 at 12:19 AM. Additionally, vancomycin was started on 08/22/2125 at 08:23 AM.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the right leg tenderness, which has improved. 

Vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.3 C (99.1 F), HR: 76 bpm (58-76), BP: 144/66 mmHg (89/103-144/89), RR: 16 breaths/min (11-27), SpO2: 99%, and heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. CVP is 16 mmHg (12-23). 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished and overweight individual without acute distress. Eyes, conjunctiva, head/ears/nose/throat, lymphatic, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, respiratory/chest, and musculoskeletal examinations are unremarkable. Abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender bowel sounds present without distention or tenderness. Extremities reveal absent pulses in the right leg, but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination indicates an attentive patient who follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 35.6-28.6 thousand/mm3, slightly elevated Hct and Plt levels, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and elevated lactate level. Other lab results, including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and liver function tests, are within normal ranges or show mild elevations. Blood cultures indicate group B streptococcus infection.

Assessment and plan include sepsis (improved), hypotension (improved), bacteremia (likely due to skin infection), and right leg cellulitis (treated with antimicrobials). The patient will continue to receive supportive care, maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg, and monitor fluid balance. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:
1. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate level suggests possible organ dysfunction due to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient may be at risk of respiratory failure if they develop significant respiratory distress or if there is worsening of the current condition.
3. Renal failure: The elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction.
4. Cardiovascular collapse: The patient's hypotension and sepsis put them at risk for cardiovascular collapse.
5. Infection spread: If the source of infection is not appropriately managed, there is a risk of the infection spreading to other sites.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), especially with the absence of pulses in the right leg.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional support should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 99-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of multiple comorbidities, including cirrhosis, which may contribute to his current condition. The patient's right lower extremity shows signs of cellulitis with hemorrhagic blistering lesions, indicating a possible source of infection. He has been receiving various antibiotics for treatment. His vital signs are generally stable, but he appears more fatigued today. The patient's pain has decreased in the right leg. Notable findings from the physical examination include warm skin with erythema over the right lower extremity and hemorrhagic blistering lesions. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's coagulopathy has improved. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued or progressive sepsis: The patient's increased WBC count and return of bandemia indicate ongoing infection. Expansion of antimicrobials is planned to address this concern.
2. Deep infection or collection in the right leg: The presence of cellulitis with hemorrhagic blistering lesions suggests a deep infection or collection. Close monitoring and appropriate intervention are necessary.
3. Poor clearance of infection due to leg edema: The patient's leg edema may hinder the clearance of the infection. Managing the edema could help improve infection control.
4. Amylase elevation: The patient's elevated amylase level should be monitored serially,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, streptococcal (skin source)
   SEPSIS -- concern for continued or progressive sepsis (increased WBC,
   return of bandemia, more fatigued).  Plan to expand antimicrobials.
   LEG CELLULITIS -- concern for deep infection or collection; currently
   continues mild improvement, and CPK continues to normalize.  Continue
   to monitor exam.  Low threshold for further imaging (CT vs. MRI).
   Surgery to continue to follow.
   LEG EDEMA -- likely contributing to poor clearance of infection.
   AMYLASE elevation
 Normal abdominal exam.  Monitor serial amylase.
   Abd exam WNL currently.
   COAGULOPATHY -- improved.  Underlying cirrhosis.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Follow I/O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 99-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with various interventions and treatments being implemented.

The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/59 to 143/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) has been consistently at 14 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 28.6 to 35.6 thousand cells per microliter. The platelet count has been relatively stable, ranging from 81 to 138 thousand cells per microliter. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range, but there have been fluctuations in other lab values such as creatinine, sodium, potassium, and liver enzymes.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for the treatment of sepsis, including ampicillin, vancomycin, and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn). The patient's pain level has been reported as mild, localized to the right leg. The patient's right lower extremity has shown signs of nodular lesion with hemorrhagic blistering, which has"
