","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 31-year-old female, was admitted for a myomectomy procedure. During the surgery, she experienced significant blood loss, requiring a massive transfusion of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of platelets. The patient's vital signs have been closely monitored, with a low blood pressure reading of 90/90 mmHg and a decreased urine output from 250 mL to 50 mL. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) was initially 25.6% but improved to 28.8% after receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient was successfully extubated this morning after being intubated overnight. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH level of 7.42, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 547, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 7.6 L/min. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung fields, supple neck, regular heart rhythm, and no"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old female who presented for multiple myomectomy, a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids. The surgery was complicated by significant blood loss, requiring a massive transfusion of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of platelets. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been monitored regularly, and it remains stable but at risk for complications related to the massive transfusion and potential further bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complications of massive transfusion therapy: The patient has received a significant amount of blood products, which can lead to complications such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and volume overload.
2. Further bleeding: Although hemostasis was achieved during surgery, there is still a risk of further bleeding, especially considering the patient's low platelet count and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT).
3. Respiratory issues: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress post-surgery. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and potential extubation failure if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT due to immobilization and recent major surgery. Prophylactic subcutaneous he"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old female who underwent multiple myomectomy surgery. The surgery resulted in significant blood loss, requiring a massive transfusion of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of platelets. 

The patient's current condition includes being intubated and sedated, with a recent attempt at extubation that resulted in hypotension and decreased urine output. She is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. Her blood pressure is within the normal range, and her heart rate is slightly elevated. 

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count and hematocrit levels, indicating ongoing blood loss or transfusion requirements. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function, are within normal limits. 

The assessment and plan include monitoring of blood counts, coagulation parameters, and fibrinogen levels every 8 hours. The patient is being transfused for platelets below 80,000/mm3, hematocrit below 21, cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen below 100 mg/dL, and fresh frozen plasma for an INR above 1.5. Lactate levels are decreasing, indicating improvement in tissue perfusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old female who underwent a myomectomy surgery and experienced significant blood loss requiring a massive transfusion. The patient's current condition includes being intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's history of massive transfusion, low oxygen saturation levels, and the presence of risk factors such as trauma and surgery increase the likelihood of developing ARDS. Monitoring for signs of respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates is crucial.

2. Trauma-related complications: The patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including a trauma line in the right neck and an arterial line. There is a risk of complications associated with these invasive procedures, such as infection, thrombosis, or bleeding.

3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and recent surgery. Prophylactic measures like subcutaneous heparin should be implemented as planned.

4. Infection: Prolonged intubation and the use of invasive lines and catheters increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Strict infection control practices and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis should be maintained.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old female who presented for multiple myomectomy on an elective basis. The surgery was complicated by significant blood loss requiring a massive transfusion of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of platelets.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, tidal volume set at 450 mL, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 90s and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 60s. The patient's heart rate is elevated at 111 beats per minute, and their temperature is within normal limits at 37.8°C (100°F).

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 30.0% to 28.8% due to the massive transfusion and ongoing bleeding. The patient's platelet count is stable, with values ranging from 140 to 134 thousand per microliter. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level at 3.2 milliequivalents per liter.

The patient's respiratory support is being weaned, and plans are in place to extubate her in the morning. The patient's urine"

","The patient is a 31-year-old female who underwent an elective myomectomy for a fibroid uterus and experienced massive blood loss during the operation, requiring a massive transfusion of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2 units of platelets, 1 unit of cryoprecipitate, and 4 liters of fluids. Hemostasis was achieved, and the patient was transferred to the ICU for post-operative monitoring.

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient required invasive ventilation and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. The patient's vital signs showed tachycardia with a heart rate (HR) of 116 beats per minute, hypotension with blood pressure (BP) of 122/61 mmHg, and tachypnea with respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was maintained at 100%. The patient's weight remained unchanged at 76 kg.

The patient received 1 unit of PRBC transfusion to increase hematocrit (Hct) from 26.5% to 28.8%. The patient was extubated this morning before rounds, and was breathing comfortably with a tidal volume (Vt) of 280 mL, set at 450 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 71, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH"

   uterine fibroids, OR c/b intraop 3.5 liter blood loss, hypotension
   requiring vasopressors, and massive transfusion.
   Doing well post extubation pre-rounds.
   Agree with plan to follow serial h/h, as risk of continued oozing.
   Keep active t and screen. Ica, plts and coags have remained wnl. MAPs
   ok, but remains tachy, likely from pain and hypovolemia, as CVP is
   low.  Will bolus IVFs and follow urine outpt.  Pain control with
   morphine following resp status.  Doing well post-extubation, will
   follow sats and check abg.  Incentive spirometer giving splinting from
   suture pain. Continue co-management with ob team.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old female who underwent an elective myomectomy for uterine fibroids and experienced significant blood loss during the operation. She required vasopressors and a massive transfusion. The patient is now in the ICU for post-operative care.

Key points from the note include:
- The patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2 units of platelets, 1 unit of cryoprecipitate, and 4 liters of fluids.
- She was intubated and mechanically ventilated upon arrival to the ICU but was successfully extubated this morning.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 122/61 to 167/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg, indicating low fluid volume.
- Fluid balance shows a net intake of 12,385 mL and output of 5,200 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 7,185 mL.

","The patient is a 31-year-old female who presented for a myomectomy surgery, which was complicated by significant blood loss requiring a massive transfusion. She received 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of platelets. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels remain stable but are at risk for complications related to transfusion therapy and further bleeding. The patient requires intravenous fluids (IVF) boluses to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) and is being closely monitored for any signs of complications such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has also been experiencing a fever, with a temperature of 101.1°F, which could be due to a new infection such as urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), Clostridium difficile (C. diff), or surgical site infection. However, the OB/GYN team believes it may be a benign inflammatory reaction to the recent surgery. Cultures have been sent, and antibiotics will be discontinued unless suspicion for infection is high.

The patient was intubated after surgery but successfully extubated yesterday. She is currently on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is encouraged to use incentive spirometry. Antibiotics will be discontinued once she is no longer on mechanical ventilation. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been ordered to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old female who presented for multiple myomectomy and experienced significant blood loss during the procedure, requiring a massive transfusion of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of platelets. She is currently in the ICU with invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated this morning. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable but remain at risk for complications related to transfusion therapy and further bleeding. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and she is now on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. She has a fever of 101.1°F and an elevated heart rate in the 120s-130s range. Blood cultures were sent, and she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further assessment and management are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Transfusion-related complications: Given the massive transfusion received by the patient, there is a risk of complications such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), or transfusion-associated dyspnea (TAD).
2. Bleeding: Despite achieving hemostasis during surgery, the patient's Hct levels are at risk for further decline due to ongoing bleeding or rebleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and serial Hct measurements is necessary.
3. Infection: The patient's fever"

   Assessment and Plan
 Assessment and Plan: 31 yoF w/ a h/o significant uterine fibroids,
   presented for multiple myomectomy on an elective basis on [**10-5**]
   complicated by 3500 EBL requiring massive transfusion.
   .
   # Blood loss: related to multiple myomectomy, hemostasis acheived per
   OB/Gyn surgeons.  Has rec'd massive transfusion of 11uPRBC with 8 units
   of FFP and 2 units plts. Hct remains stable but at risk for
   complications of transfusion therapy and further bleeding.  Currently
   w/ active type and screen and excellent access
   - bolus with 250cc NS with fluid monitoring
   - monitor hcty q12h
   - monitor coags
   - Transfuse for plts < 80, hct < 21, cryo for fibrinogen < 100 and FFP
   for INR > 1.5 or if requiring more PRBCs
   - monitor coags/plts, Ca, monitor for TRALI/ARDS and other
   complications of massive tranfusion
   - f/u OB gyn recs, hold off on sc heparin as long as hct stable at 10AM
   .
   # Respiratory: on ventilator after surgery.  Extubated successfully
   yesterday.
   - follow O2 sats
   - check ABG
   - incentive spirometry
   - d/c vanc, cipro, flagyl
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely from pain and hypovolemia.  Still showing low
   CVP.
   - Will bolus IVFs and follow urine output.
   # PPX: Protonix, pneumoboots for now, consider switch to SC heparin
   this AM pending stable Hct
   .
   FEN: touch base with OB re:diet
   .
   Code:  Full
   .
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement may be called out to OB
   service this PM, will need to remove trauma line before leaving the
   floors.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old female who underwent a myomectomy surgery and experienced significant blood loss requiring a massive transfusion. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory: The patient is on a ventilator due to post-operative respiratory distress. She was successfully extubated yesterday but remains on supplemental oxygen. There are concerns about the possibility of developing ARDS or TRALI as a complication of massive transfusion.

2. Hemodynamic: The patient has a low central venous pressure (CVP) indicating potential hypovolemia. The patient's heart rate is in the tachycardic range (120s-130s), which could be attributed to pain and hypovolemia. Frequent monitoring of urine output and fluid balance is recommended.

3. Coagulation: The patient received a massive transfusion consisting of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. The patient's coagulation profile should be closely monitored for any signs of bleeding or coagulopathy. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) are in place.

4. Infection: The patient has a fever of 101.1°F, and blood cultures were sent. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl) have been initiated. Urine culture results are pending.

5. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed, and appropriate enteral or parenteral nutrition may be required based on her ability to tolerate oral intake.

6. Glycemic control: Monitoring of blood glucose levels is important to prevent or manage hyperglycemia, which can increase the risk of infection and other complications.

7. Disposition: The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and she may be called out to the OB service later in the day. It is important to remove the trauma line before leaving the floors.

In summary, the patient is a postoperative female with a history of significant blood loss and massive transfusion. She is at risk for complications such as ARDS, TRALI, coagulopathy, infection, and hypoglycemia. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old female who presented for a multiple myomectomy on an elective basis. The procedure was complicated by significant blood loss requiring a massive transfusion of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of platelets. Despite receiving the transfusion, the patient continues to require intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses for a dropping central venous pressure (CVP).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently intubated but successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 26.9% to 27.5%, platelet count of 129 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 124 mg/dL, and elevated PT/PTT/INR levels indicating coagulopathy. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of significant uterine fibroids and presented for an elective multiple myomectomy."

The patient is also experiencing a fever, which may be due to a new infection such as urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), Clostridium difficile (C. diff), or infection at the surgical site. However, the OB/Gyn team believes that this may be a benign inflammatory reaction to the recent surgery. The patient will be monitored, and cultures will be followed up.

The patient was placed on a ventilator after surgery but was successfully extubated yesterday. She will continue to have her oxygen saturation levels monitored and will be encouraged to use incentive spirometry. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed no pulmonary embolism (PE), but revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.

There is also an enlarged pulmonary artery (PA) seen on imaging, which could be due to high output heart or chronic increased demand caused by multiple fibroids,"
