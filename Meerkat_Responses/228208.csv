   Assessment and Plan
 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Continue lasix
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath
   in [**2197-3-13**] resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the
   mid-LCX and proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   Heparin gtt d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - supplemental O2
   - BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs for volume replacement [**5-23**]. Crit
   28.1 today.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   .
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Continue lasix
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath
   in [**2197-3-13**] resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the
   mid-LCX and proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   Heparin gtt d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - supplemental O2
   - BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs for volume replacement [**5-23**]. Crit
   28.1 today,
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   .
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, recent dual endothelial stent placement, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dementia.
- She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress, suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia, and acute decompensated heart failure.
- The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, elevated cardiac enzymes suggestive of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia, acute mental status changes, acute kidney injury (ARF), and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient may experience worsening respiratory function if supplemental oxygen is not maintained at adequate levels or if underlying lung cancer progresses.
2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: There is a risk of further myocardial damage or recurrent ischemic events if the underlying cause of the elevated cardiac enzymes is not addressed appropriately.
3. Acute mental status changes: The patient may continue to experience confusion or worsening cognitive impairment if hypoxia, infection, electrolyte imbalances, or poor sleep are not managed effectively.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's renal function may deteriorate if prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal causes of ARF are not identified and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent drug-eluting stent placement, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, and multiple lung lesions concerning for lung cancer. The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress, requiring non-rebreather (NRB) mask.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress due to healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute decompensated heart failure (dCHF) exacerbation, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's oxygen saturation levels are low, and there is evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The patient requires supplemental oxygen, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, diuretics for fluid overload, and an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.

2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia from AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR)/acute CHF exacerbation. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down but remain elevated. The patient should continue with full-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, statin therapy, beta-blockers,"

 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and low Na at OSH
   and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt also has sig.
   wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although does not carry a
   diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.  Also concern for PE
   given lack of activity and question of cancer (lung, colon).
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, may need CPAP
   - Vanc/zosyn to cover Healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Check BNP
   - ECHO
   - Duresis as tolerated by blood pressure (initially in setting of
   getting diltiazem 20 mg IV)
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   - f/u LENI's for concern of PE as CTA contraindicated given ARF and V/Q
   scan would likely not be helpful given pre-existing lung disease
   (prelim read neg)
   - start heparin gtt for ?PE
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath
   in [**2197-3-13**] resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the
   mid-LCX and proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   - start heparin gtt
   - ECHO for WMA
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection, and
   hyponatremia.  Not hypercarbic on ABG.  Pt also has afib off
   anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic deficits on exam.  Less concern
   for possible metastatic cancer to brain given no acute intracranial
   abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though there was no follow-up MRI.  CT
   head did note areas of encephalomalacia consistent with prior infarct,
   which may give patient poor reserve with infection, electrolyte
   imbalances.
   - supplemental O2
   - bcxs
   - U/A, UCx
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn
   - hold mirtazipine for now and other sedating medications
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  HCT here 28.9 this
   AM, currently 25.0.  No obvious bleeding at this time.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - monitor HCT carefully while on heparin gtt
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Check urine lytes, osms
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  Currently relatively hypotensive.
   Initially dropped pressure to dilt.  Some concern for early sepsis.
   Also may be cardiogenic given elevated troponins.
   - ECHO
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   .
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and dual-episode stent placement. She also has chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (afib), diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, and multiple lung lesions concerning for lung cancer. The patient was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for respiratory distress requiring nonrebreather (NRB) mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely multifactorial, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute decompensated heart failure (CHF), and possibly pulmonary embolism (PE) given her smoking history and lack of activity. She is receiving supplemental oxygen and may require continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Antibiotics have been started to cover healthcare-associated pneumonia, and further investigations such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and echocardiogram (ECHO) are planned.

2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which could indicate a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR)/acute CHF exacerbation. There are no acute ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram (EKG), and she denies current chest pain. The patient"

   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with mod pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would

   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and two drug-eluting stents in the mid-left circumflex artery and proximal obtuse marginal artery. She also has diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, and is a heavy smoker. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and transferred from another hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be multifactorial, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute decompensated heart failure (CHF), and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's smoking history and lung lesions on CT chest raise concerns for lung cancer as well.

2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which could indicate an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, there are no acute ischemic changes on the EKG, and the patient had a cardiac catheterization in the past with placement of a drug-eluting stent.

3. Acute mental status changes: The patient's mental status changes could be secondary to hypoxia, infection, hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep. The patient is not hypercarbic on ABG, and there is less concern for possible metastatic cancer to the brain.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a baseline creatinine (Cr) level of 2.1, and her Cr level at OSH admission was 2.0. The AKI is likely prerenal due to concomitant hyponatremia that responded to intravenous fluids (IVFs) and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has been trending down, and she received 2-3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) at OSH. The patient received 1 unit PRBCs on arrival to the ICU for volume replacement. The anemia is likely due to bleeding, but further investigation is needed.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium (Na) levels have responded to IVFs at OSH and are likely secondary to volume depletion. No overt volume overload outside of pulmonary edema was observed.

7. Hypertension/relative hypotension: The patient was relatively hypotensive in the setting of diltiazem for atrial fibrillation. Early sepsis or cardiogenic causes are less likely, and the patient's blood pressures are now stable.

8. History of Strep bovis bacteremia: The patient had a history of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia, and a biopsy of a polyp showed an adenoma, raising concern for colon cancer.

9. History of spiculated lung lesion: The patient has a history of a spiculated lung lesion, which requires further investigation with a bronchoscopic biopsy and PET scan as an outpatient.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: Diabetic/heart-healthy diet
- Glycemic control: Monitoring and management of blood glucose levels
- Lines: Placement of appropriate size peripheral IV lines
- Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with heparin subcutaneously, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions
- Communication: Daughter available for updates and discussions regarding the patient's condition
- Code status: Full code

 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  No chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]
   resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LCX and
   proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG. Heparin gtt
   d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE thought to be likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - continue supplemental O2 to avoid hypoxia
   - infectious work up shows BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - haldol prn
   - ? MRI when stable
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure. Stable.
   - Urine eos negative.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs for volume replacement [**5-23**]. Crit
   28.1 today.
   - guaiac stools

   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib

   80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr
   2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.
   1.  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite diuresis and
   antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved wince admission to
   the ICU. Overnight needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia. Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history
   (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Some
   wheezing on exam this AM. Will consider that the lack of improvement
   could be attributed to an unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Will initiate
   steroids.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to liberate as
   tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide with goal of negative one to two
   liter fluid balance
   - Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia (ending
   on evening of [**5-28**])
   - Continue nebulizers and initiate prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5
   days to treat for COPD exacerbation
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:
   Troponin peak to 1.39 and trended down on AM labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
   could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality. Was
   originally on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI; however, this has since
   been discontinued. No chest pain complaints in last two days.
   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   3.  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given two nights ago. In last two night
   has received mirtazapine for assistance with sleep. In last two days,
   the patient has been lethargic. Overnight had mild hypercarbia to 57.
   - continue supplemental O2 to avoid hypoxia
   - Infectious work up shows BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - haldol prn
   - ? MRI when stable
   4.  ARF:
   Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most likely prerenal
   given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs and component of
   poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be ATN as was
   hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure. Stable.
   - Urine eos negative.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs on arrival to ICU for volume
   replacement [**5-23**]. Crit stable (28.1) today.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

   80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr
   2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite exceptional diuresis
   and antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission
   to the ICU. Overnight on [**5-24**] needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia.
   Although does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking
   history (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Some
   wheezing on exam this AM. Will consider that the lack of improvement
   could be attributed to an unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Will initiate
   steroids. Question of aspiration as she has been more somnolent
   recently.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to liberate as
   tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide with goal of negative one to two
   liter fluid balance
   - Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia (ending
   on evening of [**5-28**])
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels less than 15. Was 22.5
   this AM and will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN and standing
   - Initiate prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5 days to treat for COPD
   exacerbation
   - Hold meals while somnolent and consider speech and swallow evaluation
   #  Elevated cardiac enzymes:
   Troponin peak to 1.39 and trended down on AM labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
   could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality. Was
   originally on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI; however, this has since
   been discontinued. No chest pain complaints in last two days.
   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   #  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given two nights ago. In last two night
   has received mirtazapine for assistance with sleep. In last two days,
   the patient has been lethargic. Overnight had mild hypercarbia to 57
   which corrected with BiPAP ventiliation. Infectious work-up show
   negative urine and blood cultures thus far.
   - Hold mirtazapine for now
   - BiPAP again overnight if evening ABG shows ongoing hypercarbia
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   #  [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Cr was 2.9 upon
   admission here and has been stable. Was 3.0 this AM. BUN has been
   trending down and was 70 this AM.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels less than 15. Was 22.5
   this AM and will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   #  Anemia:
   Was transfused at OSH prior to admission here; however, HCT has been
   stable without transfusion need while hospitalized here. Was 29.9 this
   AM. Stools have been guaiac negative.
   - Continue to trend HCT daily.
   #  HTN/relative hypotension:
   On admission to ICU relatively hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for
   a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - Cont. metoprolol for afib
   - Continue to hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   #  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia:
   Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   #  H/o spiculated lung lesion:
   Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for 3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, recent dual vessel disease, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 2.1), atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, multiple lung lesions concerning for lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dementia. She was transferred from an outside hospital for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.

The patient presented with hypoxia, and despite exceptional diuresis and antibiotics, there has not been a significant improvement since admission to the ICU.

Although she does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a significant smoking history (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).

The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes with Troponin peak at 1.39 and trending down on AM labs on [**5-24**] raise concerns for possible myocardial infarction.

   Assessment and Plan
 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with mod pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  No chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]
   resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LCX and
   proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG. Heparin gtt
   d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE thought to be likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - continue supplemental O2 to avoid hypoxia
   - Infectious work up shows BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - haldol prn
   - ? MRI when stable
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure. Stable.
   - Urine eos negative.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs on arrival to ICU for volume
   replacement [**5-23**]. Crit stable (28.1) today.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and dual-epithelial stent placement in two coronary arteries. She also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, and multiple lung lesions on CT chest concerning for lung cancer. The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress, acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF), and elevated cardiac enzymes. She received a total of 3.5 liters of fluid intake and had 3.5 liters of urine output, indicating adequate fluid balance. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 116/35 mmHg and heart rate of 74 bpm. She is on supplemental oxygen with a goal oxygen saturation of 88-94%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 49, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 163, indicating respiratory acidosis with partial compensation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be multifactorial, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute exacerbation of CHF, and possibly pulmonary embolism (PE). 
2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, suggesting a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia due to atr"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr
   2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite exceptional diuresis
   and antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission
   to the ICU. Overnight on [**5-24**] needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia.
   Although does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking
   history (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Will
   consider that the lack of improvement could be attributed to an
   unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Initiated steroids yesterday with mild
   improvement in oxygen sats overnight. Question of aspiration yesterday;
   however, tolerate regular diet with intact mental status, so this does
   not seem to be as concerning unless aspiration is silent.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to liberate as
   tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide with goal of negative one liter
   fluid balance
   - Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia (ending
   on evening of [**5-28**])
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels. Was 15.3 this AM and
   will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN and standing
   - Continue prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5 days to treat for COPD
   exacerbation (ending on [**5-29**])
   #  Elevated cardiac enzymes:
   Troponin peak to 1.39 and trended down on AM labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
   could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality. Was
   originally on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI; however, this has since
   been discontinued. No chest pain complaints in last three days.
   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   #  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given on night following admission.
   Received BiPAP on night of [**5-24**] indicated for mild hypercarbia and
   hypoxia at night. Had been lethargic yesterday morning and was going to
   hold mirtazapine; however, patient became agitated at night and
   mirtazapine was given. Patient calm and conversant this morning after a
   quiet night.
   - Restart mirtazapine 7.5 mg QHS
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   #  [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Cr was 2.9 upon
   admission here and has been stable. Was 2.8 this AM. BUN has been
   trending down and was 68 this AM.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels. Was 15.3 this AM and
   will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   #  Anemia:
   Was transfused at OSH prior to admission here; however, HCT has been
   stable without transfusion need while hospitalized here. Was 29.9 this
   AM. Stools have been guaiac negative.
   - Continue to trend HCT daily.
   #  HTN/relative hypotension:
   On admission to ICU relatively hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for
   a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - Cont. metoprolol for afib
   - Continue to hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   #  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia:
   Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   #  H/o spiculated lung lesion:
   Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for 3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, recent dual-episode myocardial infarction, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, multiple lung lesions concerning for lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, suspected pneumonia, and acute heart failure. Despite diuresis and antibiotics, the patient's hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission. The patient also has elevated cardiac enzymes and evidence of pulmonary vasculature overload with pulmonary artery hypertension. She was previously on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI but it has since been discontinued. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia, furosemide for diuresis, prednisone burst for COPD exacerbation, and mirtazapine for agitation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, infection due to immunosuppression, cardiac dysfunction, and kidney dysfunction. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in vital signs, oxygen saturation, fluid balance, and cardiac enzymes."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill, overweight/obese individual with a chief complaint of hypoxia. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently experiencing hypoxemia, hypotension (not in shock), dyspnea (shortness of breath), altered mental status (not delirium), and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 83 bpm with an irregular rhythm (atrial fibrillation), blood pressure ranging from 142/87 to 151/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula and face tent. The patient has received various medications including lasix, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. They also have multiple infusions including heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia and dyspnea indicate respiratory distress, which may progress to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, altered mental status, and leukocytosis suggests the possibility of an underlying infection leading to sepsis.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient is already experiencing atrial fibrillation. There"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/87 mmHg to 151/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including furosemide, heparin sodium, and prophylactic antibiotics. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, and troponin-T. The patient's fluid balance is negative with a total outflow of 1,755 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula and face tent, with an ABG showing a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 52, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 57.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a decrease in the amount of oxygen in the blood. This can be caused by respiratory issues, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently below the normal range. This can result from factors like"

   80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr
   2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite exceptional diuresis
   and antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission
   to the ICU. Overnight on [**5-24**] needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia.
   Although does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking
   history (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Will
   consider that the lack of improvement could be attributed to an
   unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Initiated steroids yesterday with mild
   improvement in oxygen sats overnight. Question of aspiration yesterday;
   however, tolerate regular diet with intact mental status, so this does
   not seem to be as concerning unless aspiration is silent.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to liberate as
   tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide with goal of negative one liter
   fluid balance
   - Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia (ending
   on evening of [**5-28**])
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels. Was 15.3 this AM and
   will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN and standing
   - Continue prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5 days to treat for COPD
   exacerbation (ending on [**5-29**])
   #  Elevated cardiac enzymes:
   Troponin peak to 1.39 and trended down on AM labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
   could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality. Was
   originally on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI; however, this has since
   been discontinued. No chest pain complaints in last three days.
   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   #  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given on night following admission.
   Received BiPAP on night of [**5-24**] indicated for mild hypercarbia and
   hypoxia at night. Had been lethargic yesterday morning and was going to
   hold mirtazapine; however, patient became agitated at night and
   mirtazapine was given. Patient calm and conversant this morning after a
   quiet night.
   - Restart mirtazapine 7.5 mg QHS
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   #  [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Cr was 2.9 upon
   admission here and has been stable. Was 2.8 this AM. BUN has been
   trending down and was 68 this AM.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels. Was 15.3 this AM and
   will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   #  Anemia:
   Was transfused at OSH prior to admission here; however, HCT has been
   stable without transfusion need while hospitalized here. Was 29.9 this
   AM. Stools have been guaiac negative.
   - Continue to trend HCT daily.
   #  HTN/relative hypotension:
   On admission to ICU relatively hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for
   a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - Cont. metoprolol for afib
   - Continue to hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   #  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia:
   Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), recent dual-epoxy stent placement, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AF), multiple lung lesions concerning for lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and dementia. She presented to the hospital with respiratory distress, which is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient also has a history of acute heart failure, as indicated by B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and imaging findings.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: Despite exceptional diuresis and antibiotics, the patient's hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission to the ICU. Overnight on [**5-24**], she needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia. Although she does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, her significant smoking history (reported as 100 pack-years) raises the possibility of an unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Steroids were initiated yesterday with mild improvement in oxygen saturation overnight. The question of aspiration yesterday is less concerning unless aspiration is silent.
