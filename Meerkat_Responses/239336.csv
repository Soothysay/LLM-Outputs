","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of liver transplant, ulcerative colitis, anoxic brain damage, renal failure, and hypernatremia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 98/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving multiple IV fluids and medications, including tacrolimus, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and others. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, and slightly low platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal range except for sodium which is slightly elevated. The patient has two peripheral lines and is being monitored closely for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) due to his immunocompromised state from the liver transplant. There is a risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient has a history of renal failure, and there are ongoing efforts to manage his fluid balance and electrolyte levels. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent further kidney injury.
3. Liver Dysfunction:"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give 100 meq sodium bicarb in d5w at 200 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h
   - due to frequent lab draws and need for IVF, will get PICC placed
   today
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.
   - continue to hold tacrolimus, likely needs dose adjustment
   - trend creatinine
   - will hold off on renal ultrasound for now given improvement in
   creatinine
   - renal consult as above
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> consider GI consult or confer with Liver team
   - guaiac stools
   - send C diff toxin & follow up result from EMMC
   - continue mesalamine
   # WBCs in urine: Culture pending, on cipro.
   .
   # Cognitive deficits: Continue home medications, including ritalin,
   escitalopram, and risperdal.
   .
   # FEN: sips for now, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, bowel meds
   .
   # Access: PICC placement today
   .
   # CODE: full code, discussed with patient's husband
   .
   # COMM: With patient and husband
   .
   # DISP: ICU care until access established and sodium stabilized

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of two liver transplants, currently admitted to the ICU for diarrhea and hypernatremia. She has multiple medical conditions, including ulcerative colitis, anoxic brain damage, a history of renal failure, and hypernatremia. The patient is still dehydrated with a sodium level of 160 and chloride level of 140. Her creatinine levels have improved from 3.8 at OSH to 1.7 on our labs. She is on aggressive fluid repletion and renal consultation has been sought due to elevated sodium levels and difficulty in treatment, especially considering her diarrhea and renal insufficiency. The patient has two peripheral lines and it is planned to place a PICC line today. She is being covered empirically for C. diff with Flagyl, and her recent antibiotics include ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Other medications include mesalamine, ritalin, escitalopram, and risperdal. The patient is on full code status and will receive ICU care until access is established and sodium is stabilized."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until

   several days of abd pain and diarrhea, hypernatremia (154-161) and
   ARF.  Treated empirically for C diff with flagyl (PO at OSH changed to
   IV here).  Due to difficult access and need for frequent blood draws
   was transferred to ICU this am for further management. Renal c/s
   appreciated.  Fluids changed to D5W with slow improvement in

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of two liver transplants, currently admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
- She has a complicated medical history including end-stage liver disease (ESLD), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), ulcerative colitis (UC), anoxic brain injury, hypothyroidism, and seizures.
- The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia, acute renal failure (ARF), diarrhea, cognitive deficits, and potential Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.
- She is being treated empirically for C. diff with Flagyl and also receiving ciprofloxacin due to her history of UC.
- Her sodium levels are slowly improving, but her renal function is still compromised. Fluids have been changed to D5W, and she is receiving IV fluids at 150 cc/hour.
- The patient's cognitive impairment is a result of anoxic brain injury.
- She has a baseline cognitive impairment and is currently unable to cooperate with exams.
- Active issues include managing hypernatremia, addressing the cause of diarrhea, managing ARF, optimizing medication dosages, and monitoring for complications such as C. diff infection and urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient's overall condition remains critical, and she will continue to be monitored in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until
   # WBCs in urine: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.
   .
   # Cognitive deficits: Continue home medications, including ritalin,
   escitalopram, and risperdal.
   .
   # FEN: sips for now, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: subQ heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV, PICC assessment [**12-8**]

   # CODE: full code, discussed with patient's husband

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of post-surgical complications, including two liver transplants. She was admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
- The patient's sodium levels are still high, indicating ongoing dehydration. It is unclear what fluids the patient was transferred on, but she has been changed to half-normal saline (1/2NS). The doctor suggests further repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of sodium chloride.
- The patient's chloride levels are also elevated, which could contribute to the hypernatremia. The doctor has consulted a renal specialist for input on treating the elevated sodium levels in the context of the patient's ongoing diarrhea and renal insufficiency.
- The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 3.8 at OSH to 1.7 on our labs, suggesting that acute renal failure is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. The doctor wants to monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust medications accordingly.
- The patient's recent use of ibuprofen for pain could have precipitated acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The doctor has restarted tacrolimus with morning checks and is trending creatinine levels.
- The patient's diarrhea may be caused by Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) due to chronic institutionalization and a history of previous C. diff infection. Alternatively, it could represent a flare-up of ulcerative colitis. The doctor has covered empirically for C."

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a medical history of two liver transplants, currently admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia. She has been aggressive in repleting sodium chloride, resulting in a chloride level of 140. It is suggested to further replenish with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl due to her dehydration and renal insufficiency. The patient's sodium correction has improved by 11 points since the previous blood draw. She is being monitored closely for hypernatremia and has had her D5W intake decreased to 100 cc/hour to slow down the sodium correction while continuing fluid repletion for stool output.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7 on our labs. This is likely secondary to volume depletion with the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. The presence of urine eosinophils suggests checking the CBC/diff for eosinophils as well. The patient recently received ibuprofen for pain, which could precipitate acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Her tacrolimus level was 5.6 at EMMC and 5.2 on [**12-9**]. Tacrolimus has been restarted with daily checks.

The patient's diarrhea is being empirically covered for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) with Flagyl, and"

   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with plan as
   outlined above. She is continuing to have substantial stool output but
   Na is correcting appropriately with free water.  PO intake remains poor
   but she is taking clear liqs
 hard to tell if she is thirsty.  First
   stool is pending but seems most likely output is due to her colitis
   which will likely require steroids.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of two liver transplants. She was admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia. The patient's sodium levels are still elevated, but there has been improvement since starting D5W. The plan is to slow down the sodium correction rate and continue fluid repletion for stool output. Renal consultation has been sought due to the elevated sodium levels and difficulty in treating them in the presence of diarrhea and renal insufficiency.

The patient also has acute renal failure, which appears to be resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. The creatinine level has improved from 3.8 at OSH to 1.7 on our labs. The presence of urine eosinophils suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possibly precipitated by ibuprofen intake for pain. Tacrolimus levels are being monitored, and the medication has been restarted with daily checks.

Diarrhea is a concern, potentially caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) given the patient's chronic institutionalization and history of C. diff infection. Antibiotics have been started empirically to cover for C. diff, and ciprofloxacin has been added due to the patient's history of ulcerative colitis. Stool guaiac tests are being done, and a C. diff toxin assay has been sent.

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is also present, and the patient is being"
