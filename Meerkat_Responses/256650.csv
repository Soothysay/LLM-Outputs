","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure, and underwent a BMS implantation in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) with ongoing chest pain, shortness of breath, and poor urine output.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD), contrast nephropathy, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, anemia, and potential bilateral hemothoraces. She also has a history of diabetes mellitus controlled with oral medications and insulin.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, worsening heart failure, respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema or hemothoraces, further bleeding events, and potential infection due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.

Overall, the patient's condition is unstable and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple organ systems."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent stenting of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) with bare metal stents (BMS). She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) due to ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath, along with poor urine output.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions:

1. Oliguric Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient likely has contrast nephropathy due to recent PCI, which is not responding to aggressive diuresis. Her baseline CKD is related to DM2 and a history of contrast nephropathy. Her fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and fractional urea excretion (FeUrea) are both consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal consultation is planned for consideration of hemodialysis (HD) given her respiratory status/hypoxia. She will be tried on a higher dose of Lasix with diuril 500mg IV and Lasix 200mg IV, while continuing Lasix gtt.

2. CAD/Unstable Angina: The patient had proximal RCA disease and underwent BMS placement. She experienced typical anginal pain at rest with ST depressions in V4-6. She is currently chest pain-free. The patient may have demand ischemia from anemia. She will be started on aspirin, statin, and Plavix. Her beta-blocker will be held due to low blood pressure and the need for nitroglycerin.

3. Acute Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Exacerbation: The patient is oxygen-dependent and has significant rales on examination. Her shortness of breath was exacerbated by packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions and renal failure.

","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure and was transferred to the CCU for ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath. She has been diagnosed with oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). 

The patient underwent a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) where two bare-metal stents were placed in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She has a baseline CKD related to diabetes mellitus and a history of contrast nephropathy. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. The patient's fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and urea (FeUrea) are both low, consistent with ATN.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with crackles in the lungs and an oxygen requirement of 100% on a face tent. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 30, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 65. The patient has a heart rate (HR) of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 112/40 mmHg, and respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals an obese elderly female in no apparent distress, with a supple neck and jugular venous distention (JVD). She has a point-of-maximum impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line, with a regular sinus rhythm and a 2/6 mitral regurgitation (MR) murmur. There are no signs of chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, and her extremities show no clubbing or edema.

The patient's laboratory values indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.6 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 25.4%, platelet count (Plt) of 202 thousand/mm3, blood glucose (Glucose) of 222 mg/dL, and serum electrolytes including sodium (Na+) of 134 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.8 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 77 mg/dL, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 20 mEq/L, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, statin, and Plavix for coronary artery disease"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure and underwent a procedure where two bare-metal stents were placed in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). 

The patient is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath, along with poor urine output. The note indicates that she has acute renal failure (ARF), which is likely due to contrast nephropathy as shown by the presence of contrast in the kidneys on CT scan. The patient also has acute diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation, as evidenced by significant crackles on lung examination and increased jugular venous distention (JVD). 

The patient's blood tests reveal elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and potassium (K+), indicating possible chronic kidney disease (CKD) related to her diabetes. Additionally, the patient has anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.6 g/dL. 

There are multiple potential medical complications that can arise in this case. These include worsening of ARF, further exacerbation of congestive heart failure, development of hypoxia due to poor oxygenation, electrolyte imbalances, and"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), presenting with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She has been transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain and poor urine output, now in oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Oliguric Acute on Chronic CKD: The patient is likely experiencing contrast nephropathy due to recent PCI. Continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) has been initiated but is limited by coughing with changes in access pressures. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.

2. Acute Diastolic CHF Exacerbation: The patient exhibits signs of volume overload leading to heart failure, managed with CVVH. Intubation may be considered to allow for sedation and better volume removal.

3. CAD/Unstable Angina: The patient had proximal right coronary artery (RCA) disease and underwent stenting with bare-metal stents (BMS). She experienced typical anginal pain at rest and had ST depressions in leads V4-6. Currently, she is chest pain-free but may have demand ischemia from anemia. Aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel therapy should be initiated, while"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure, and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the proximal right coronary artery. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to ongoing chest pain, poor urine output, and oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely secondary to contrast nephropathy from the PCI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguric Acute on Chronic CKD: The patient's poor urine output indicates acute kidney injury on top of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. This may be due to contrast nephropathy from the recent PCI procedure. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated but is limited by coughing with changes in access pressures.
2. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient is experiencing volume overload leading to heart failure. CVVH is being managed to remove excess fluid. Intubation may be considered to allow for better volume removal.
3. Coronary Artery Disease/Unstable Angina: The patient had significant coronary artery disease with proximal RCA disease, treated with bare metal stent placement. She experienced typical anginal pain at rest with ST depressions in V4-6. She"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old woman with history of CAD s/p prior PCI, PVD, DM2
   presenting unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure,
   s/p BMS x 2 to prox RCA.  Transferred to the CCU for ongoing CP/SOB and
   poor UOP now in oliguric ARF.
   .
   # Oliguric Acute on chronic CKD: Pt likely with contrast nephropathy
   s/p PCI,
   - CVVH today, on but limited by her coughing with changes access
   pressures.
   .
   # Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation:  Volume overload leading to heart
   failure, managing with CVVH
   - Consider intubation to allow for sedation and better volume removal.
   # CAD/unstable angina:  Patient during cath found to have prox RCA
   disase, s/p BMS x 2.  Patient's typical anginal pain was occuring at
   rest and had ST depressions in V4-6.  Currently chest pain free.
   Patient may have demand ischemia from Anemia.  Patient with oxygen
   requirement (below)
   - aspirin/statin/plavix
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] given large dye load in cath lab
   - holding BB given low BP and need for nitro gtt  (for CHF, not CP)
   .
   #Cough
 likely from elevated PA pressures, but possibly from primary
   pulmonary process given alveolar infiltrartes
   - wheezy on exam, will give solumedrol pulse as cough is disrupting
   CVVH
   .
   # Bleeding / Anemia - pt with HCT of 26 - concern for RP bleed related
   to cath vs GI bleed from external hemorrhoid. Repeat HCT was decreased
   so did CT which showed no RP bleed but showed blood-dense bilat pleural
   effusions and question of pulmonary hemorrhage.
   - Pulmonary consult, may need BAL
   - Transfuse <21 or active dropping
   .
   # Rhythm: sinus rhythm.
   - tele monitoring
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: controlled per recent A1c with use of oral meds +
   insulin.
   - diabetic diet. humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Blood stools: likely hemorrhoidal bleeding given many prior negative
   colonoscopies and lack of current abd pain.  No blood in vault this
   AM.  Patient recieved 1u PRBCs
   - active T&S
   - empiric daily PPI
   - PIV

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure, and underwent balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain and poor urine output, now in oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

The patient has multiple medical complications and potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Oliguric Acute on Chronic CKD: The patient is likely experiencing contrast nephropathy due to recent PCI. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) was initiated but limited by coughing with changes in access pressures. This indicates a need for further management of kidney function.

2. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient has volume overload leading to heart failure, which is being managed with CVVH. Intubation may be considered to allow for sedation and better volume removal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was found to have proximal right coronary artery (RCA) disease, for which she received bare metal stents (BMS) implantation. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) related to diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and contrast nephropathy. She is currently in oliguric acute on chronic CKD, with no response to aggressive diuresis overnight. Her renal function is compromised, and she requires consultation for hemodialysis (HD). The patient also has acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation with significant rales on examination and an oxygen requirement of 100% on a face tent. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45% with 2+ mitral regurgitation (MR). Despite high-dose Lasix and Diuril, her urine output remains low. The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration (HCT) of 26%, which is concerning for retroperitoneal (RP) bleed or gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from an external hemorrhoid. Repeat HCT is stable now, and the patient is being monitored closely. The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of two bare metal stents in the proximal right coronary artery. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to ongoing chest pain, poor urine output, and oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD) likely related to contrast nephropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguric Acute on Chronic CKD: The patient has a history of baseline CKD related to diabetes mellitus and contrast nephropathy. She is currently oliguric and unresponsive to aggressive diuretic therapy. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) based on the findings of fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea). Renal consultation has been requested for consideration of hemodialysis (HD) given the patient's respiratory status and hypoxia.

2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)/Unstable Angina: The patient experienced typical anginal pain at rest and had ST depressions in leads V4-6 during catheterization. She underwent PCI with stent placement for proximal RCA disease. The patient may have demand ischemia due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was transferred to the CCU for ongoing chest pain and poor urine output. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with extensive bilateral consolidations in the lungs, right more than left, which might be consistent with multifocal hemorrhage. This could be due to hemorrhagic pneumonia or vasculitis. There is also a small left apical pneumothorax, bilateral grossly unchanged pleural effusions, and extensive coronary calcifications. 

The patient has oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease, likely due to contrast nephropathy from the PCI. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) was attempted but limited by coughing and changes in access pressures. The patient's dialysis line needs to be replaced today by interventional radiology (IR). 

The patient is also experiencing an acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation, likely secondary to volume overload. The patient's cardiac condition includes a history of coronary artery disease and unstable angina, for which she underwent PCI and stenting of the proximal right coronary artery. 

There are concerns about bleeding/anemia, with a hematocrit (HCT) of 26. A CT scan showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed but showed blood-dense bilateral pleural effusions and a question of pulmonary hemorrhage. 

The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm but with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). 

Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, which is controlled with oral medications and insulin, and blood stools, likely due to hemorrhoidal bleeding. 

The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and disposition are being addressed in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an obese elderly female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, anemia, and acute renal failure. She presented to the ICU with atypical pneumonia or alveolar hemorrhage, hypoxia, and anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/39-99/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

Medical Complications:
1. Atypical pneumonia or alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's CT contrast is concerning for either atypical pneumonia or alveolar hemorrhage. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and difficulty in breathing.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia as indicated by the low oxygen saturation levels. This can be a result of the underlying lung condition and may require supplemental oxygen.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, including decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. This can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
5. Impaired skin integrity:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly individual with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM) type II, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, anemia, acute renal failure, dyspnea, and other comorbidities. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

During the 24-hour period, the patient had an arterial line and midline inserted due to failed attempts at placing a right picc line. The patient underwent a CT contrast, which was concerning for atypical pneumonia or alveolar hemorrhage. Prednisone 60mg was administered once, Lantus 10u at night was started, and the sliding scale insulin regimen was made more aggressive. Fentanyl was discontinued, and pain control was managed with dilaudid 2-4mg IV q3prn. The medical team consulted with renal services regarding the arterial line, and pulmonary services were also involved. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels fluctuated between 25.1% and 24.5%. A CBCdiff was added to the morning labs prior to prednisone administration. The patient experienced hypoxia on ABG and was placed on 10L supplemental oxygen via facemask. The patient converted from atrial fibrillation (Afib) to sinus rhythm on their own.

The patient has multiple allergies, including codeine, Vasotec (enalapril maleate), Cortisporin (otic), Ciloxan (ophthalmic), atenolol, and unknown allergies to certain antibiotics. The last dose of antibiotics was not specified.

The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature range of 36.3-36.0°C (97.4-96.8°F), heart rate between 85-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/39-136/55 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 96.5 kg.

Fluid balance data shows a total input of 7,756 mL and output of 10,007 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,251 mL. Urine output has been minimal at 33 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is on CRRT with KCl infusion at 2 mEq/hour. Other medications include Lantus 10u at night and an aggressive sliding scale insulin regimen.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), along with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Hematocrit (Hct) levels have fluctuated, but remain within the normal range. Other lab values, including creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), phosphate (PO4"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was found to have proximal right coronary artery (RCA) disease, for which she received two bare metal stents (BMS). 

The patient's current condition includes cough, pleuritic chest pain, oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, and unstable angina. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, with crackles in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusions. There is also evidence of alveolar hemorrhage on CT contrast. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/39 to 136/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. There are also abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. Glucose levels are high, and kidney function tests indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). 

Radiology findings include extensive bilateral consolidations with possible hemorrh"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU). The patient has been experiencing cough, pleuritic chest pain, oliguric acute on chronic chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation. She also has a history of diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal bleeding, and potential bleeding from a hemorrhoidal source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Extensive bilateral consolidations with right-sided predominance, which could be consistent with multifocal hemorrhage. The differential diagnosis in the presence of renal failure may include vasculitis or hemorrhagic pneumonia.
2. Small left apical pneumothorax, most likely unchanged compared to the prior chest radiograph.
3. Bilateral grossly unchanged pleural effusions, which might also contain an element of hemorrhage.
4. Extensive coronary calcifications.
5. Still present contrast enhancement of kidneys and vicarious excretion of contrast through the gallbladder consistent with known renal failure.

The patient's medical conditions and complications require close monitoring and management. The potential medical complications include vasculitis, hemorrhagic pneumonia, pneumothorax, pleural effusions, coronary artery disease, and renal failure."

- She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain and poor urine output.
- The patient is currently in oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely due to contrast nephropathy following PCI.
- She also has new pulmonary infiltrates and pleuritic chest pain, which may be indicative of a pulmonary process.
- The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia.
- She has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, most likely due to hemorrhoids, but no active bleeding was observed.
- The patient is in sinus rhythm with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).
- Her diabetes mellitus is controlled with oral medications and insulin.
- She has blood-streaked stools, which are likely related to hemorrhoidal bleeding.
- The patient's nutrition is being managed, and she is on aggressive glycemic control.
- She has multiple lines and is receiving appropriate prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. The patient underwent balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in two proximal branches of the right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient's current condition includes the following medical complications:

1. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient may have multifocal pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), or aspiration pneumonia. Further evaluation is needed, including culture sensitivity testing and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Pleuritic chest pain: This is likely related to the pulmonary process. Pain management should be continued with dilaudid 2-4 mg every three hours as needed for pain.

3. Oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient is likely experiencing contrast-induced nephropathy following the PCI procedure. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) has been initiated, and the patient may tolerate hemodialysis (HD) today. A tunneled hemodialysis line will be discussed for future renal plans.

4. Acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation: The patient is experiencing volume overload leading to heart failure. CVVH is being used"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent placement of two bare-metal stents in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for ongoing chest pain, shortness of breath, and oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has cough and new pulmonary infiltrates, which may indicate pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is essential.

2. Renal Complications: The patient is oliguric and has acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to contrast nephropathy from the recent PCI. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) has been initiated, but access pressures are limiting its effectiveness. The patient requires a dialysis line replacement by interventional radiology (IR) and further evaluation by the renal team regarding prognosis for renal recovery.

3. Cardiac Complications: The patient had an acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation with volume overload leading to heart failure. She is being managed with CVVH. Intubation is being held off due to new lung findings. The patient may have demand ischemia from anemia. Medications include aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel.

4. Bleeding/Anemia: The patient has a decreased hemoglobin level, which raises concerns for a retroperitoneal bleed related to the catheterization or gastrointestinal bleed from an external hemorrhoid. A repeat hemoglobin level was decreased, and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed no retroperitoneal bleed but revealed blood-dense bilateral pleural effusions and questioned pulmonary hemorrhage. Transfusion is considered if the hemoglobin level drops below 21 or if there is active bleeding.

5. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient is in sinus rhythm but has had episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Telemetry monitoring is ongoing.

6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus is controlled with oral medications and insulin. The insulin regimen should be closely monitored due to the patient's recent hospitalization and stress.

7. Blood Stools: The patient has blood-stained stools, likely due to hemorrhoidal bleeding. Active transfusion service (T&S) evaluation and empirical daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy are recommended.

8. Allergies: The patient has known allergies to codeine, Vasotec (enalapril maleate), Cortisporin (neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone), Ciloxan (ciprofloxacin HCl), and atenolol."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, anemia, and acute renal failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm with a range of 73-98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/43 mmHg to 149/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 10-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 5,819 mL and total output of 7,441 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,622 mL. The patient has received insulin, regular, at a rate of 2 units per hour, and lorazepam (Ativan) at 1.0 mg. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, ranging from 120 mg/dL to 437 mg/dL. The patient also has elevated creatinine levels, ranging from 2.4 mg/dL to 3.0 mg/dL, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Other lab values include elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, and HCO3- of 35 mEq/L. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, and elevated blood glucose levels could lead to additional complications such as infection, further deterioration in renal function, and diabetic complications. Additionally, the patient's history of CAD and current dyspnea may indicate a risk for cardiovascular events."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain and poor urine output, now in oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's current medical issues include cough, pleuritic chest pain, oliguric AKI, acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, coronary artery disease with unstable angina, bleeding/anemia, rhythm disturbances, diabetes mellitus, blood stools, and dietary restrictions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's cough and new pulmonary infiltrates suggest the possibility of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Close monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and consideration of broadening antibiotics if there is suspicion of infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric AKI indicates impaired kidney function. Continuing CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and replacing the dialysis line may be necessary. Consultation with renal specialists is recommended to assess prognosis for renal recovery.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's acute diastolic CH"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. The patient underwent balloon stenting of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain, shortness of breath, and poor urine output, now in oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient is experiencing volume overload leading to heart failure, managed with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). There is a concern for fluid retention and worsening heart failure symptoms.
2. Contrast Nephropathy: The patient likely has contrast-induced nephropathy due to recent PCI. This condition may lead to further kidney dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary Process: The patient has cough and bilateral rales on lung examination. The possibility of pneumonia or pulmonary edema should be considered.
4. Unstable Angina: Despite the PCI, the patient's typical anginal pain is occurring at rest with ST depressions in V4-6. This indicates ongoing ischemia and potential risk for myocardial infarction.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a decreased hemoglobin concentration and concern for bleeding,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for ongoing chest pain, shortness of breath, and poor urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient may have multifocal pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or aspiration pneumonia. Further investigations such as a rapid viral test, sputum culture and sensitivity, and pleuritic chest pain management are required.
2. Oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient likely has contrast nephropathy due to recent PCI. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been initiated, and plans for tunneled hemodialysis (HD) line are being discussed.
3. Acute diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient is experiencing volume overload leading to heart failure. CVVH is being used for management, and beta-blocker therapy will be added due to higher heart rates and blood pressures.
4. Coronary artery disease/unstable angina: The patient had significant RCA disease, which was treated with"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure, following which she underwent balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). 

The patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) due to ongoing chest pain, shortness of breath, and poor urine output, indicating oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD). She also showed signs of pulmonary infiltrates, pleuritic chest pain, and anemia with a hematocrit (HCT) level of 26.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Acute diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient has volume overload leading to heart failure, which is being managed with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
2. Oliguric acute on chronic CKD: The patient likely has contrast nephropathy secondary to the recent PCI, and CVVH may be initiated today. A tunneled hemodialysis line is also being discussed.
3. Coronary artery disease/unstable angina: The patient had proximal RCA disease, and BMS placement was performed. She experienced"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. The patient underwent balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing cardiac monitoring and poor urine output (UOP), now in oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient may have multifocal pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), or aspiration pneumonia. Further investigations such as rapid viral testing, pulmonary cultures, and azithromycin therapy have been initiated.
2. Pleuritic chest pain: This is likely related to the pulmonary process. Pain management with dilaudid and steroid tapering has been continued.
3. Oliguric acute on chronic CKD: The patient likely has contrast-induced nephropathy following PCI. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been started, and plans for tunneled hemodialysis (HD) line placement are being discussed.
4. Acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation: The patient has volume overload leading to heart failure, managed with CVVH. Beta-blocker therapy has"

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure, following which she underwent balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). The patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) due to ongoing chest pain and poor urine output. She is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient has been diagnosed with possible multifocal pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), or aspiration. Further investigations, including rapid viral testing and pulmonary cultures, are planned.
2. Pleuritic chest pain: The patient's chest pain is likely related to the pulmonary process. Pain management with dilaudid and steroid tapering is being continued.
3. Oliguric acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient is likely experiencing contrast-induced nephropathy following the PCI. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) is ongoing, and plans for tunneled hemodialysis (HD) line placement are being discussed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure, and underwent placement of two bare metal stents (BMS) in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). The patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain and contrast nephropathy leading to anuria, which has now improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Contrast nephropathy: The patient experienced contrast-induced nephropathy following the catheterization procedure, leading to anuria. Although renal function has improved, close monitoring of urine output is necessary.
2. Acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation: The patient presented with volume overload leading to heart failure. Continued use of metoprolol and lasix is recommended to manage fluid balance and prevent further exacerbations.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD)/unstable angina: The patient had evidence of CAD with proximal RCA disease, treated with BMS placement. She experienced typical anginal pain at rest and had ST depressions in leads V4-6. Current management includes aspirin, statin, and Plavix, along with continued metoprolol.
4. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and placement of bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing care and management.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including contrast nephropathy leading to anuria, acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, CAD/unstable angina, pulmonary infiltrates, bleeding/anemia, and rhythm disturbances.

Treatment plans include:
1. Contrast nephropathy: Holding continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), monitoring urine output, and administering IV furosemide (Lasix) at a dose of 40mg.
2. Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: Continuing metoprolol and aiming for a negative fluid balance with the use of Lasix.
3. CAD/unstable angina: Aspirin, statin, and Plavix therapy, holding [Last Name (un) 284] due to large dye load during catheterization, and continuing metoprolol.
4. Pulmonary infiltrates: Completion of a 5-day course"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Contrast nephropathy: The patient developed acute kidney injury after receiving contrast during the PCI procedure. This is a known complication of contrast exposure, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.
2. Acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation: The patient has signs of volume overload leading to heart failure, as evidenced by her symptoms and lab findings. This condition requires careful management to prevent further deterioration.
3. Coronary artery disease/unstable angina: The patient had evidence of ischemia during the catheterization and received stents in the proximal right coronary artery. She may still be at risk for recurrent ischemic events, and ongoing monitoring and anti-ischemic medications are necessary.
4. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient has patchy crackles on lung examination and an abnormal ABG indicating respiratory compromise. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, such as pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or aspiration pneumonitis.
5. Bleeding/anemia: The patient has a decreased hemoglobin level and evidence of blood loss. The source of bleeding needs to be identified"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of two bare-metal stents in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). The patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) due to ongoing chest pain and contrast nephropathy leading to anuria. Her renal function has since improved, and she now presents with acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. Other ongoing issues include potential contrast nephropathy, pulmonary infiltrates, bleeding/anemia, rhythm disturbances, diabetes mellitus, and nutritional needs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Contrast nephropathy: The patient initially experienced anuria following contrast exposure, but her renal function has improved. Close monitoring of renal function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: The patient's volume overload has led to heart failure, which is being managed with diuretics and optimization of oxygenation. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting treatment accordingly is crucial.
3. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient may have multifocal pneumonia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DAH), or aspiration pneumonia. Further evaluation through pulmonary cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed.
4. Bleeding/anemia: The patient's hematocrit (H"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. The patient underwent placement of two bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath, as well as contrast nephropathy leading to anuria, which has now improved with renal function and congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Contrast nephropathy: The patient initially developed anuria due to contrast nephropathy, but her renal function has improved. Close monitoring of urine output (UOP) and electrolytes is necessary to ensure continued improvement in renal function.
2. Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: The patient is experiencing volume overload leading to heart failure. It is important to continue diuretic therapy with Lasix and monitor fluid balance to prevent further exacerbations.
3. CAD/unstable angina: The patient had a significant cardiac event with RCA disease and underwent stent placement. Long-term management includes antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, statin therapy for lipid control, and beta-blocker therapy for blood pressure control and reduction of myocardial"

","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) due to ongoing chest pain, shortness of breath, and contrast nephropathy leading to anuria. The patient's renal function has improved, and she is now off continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). 

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Contrast Nephropathy: The patient is now off CVVH with improved urine output. Further CVVH may be required, and an inferior vena cava filter (IVC) guided tunneled line may be needed if necessary.
2. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient had volume overload leading to heart failure, which has improved. Lasix will be continued with a goal of 1 liter negative fluid balance.
3. CAD/Unstable Angina: The patient underwent PCI with stent placement in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She was experiencing typical anginal pain at rest and had ST depressions in leads V4-6. Currently, she is chest pain-free. There may be demand ischemia from anemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She presented with unstable angina and evidence of decompensated heart failure. The patient underwent balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in two locations on the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath, as well as contrast nephropathy leading to anuria, which has since improved. The patient's renal function is now stable, and she also has an acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation due to volume overload. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Contrast nephropathy: The patient initially experienced anuria likely due to contrast nephropathy, but her renal function has improved.
2. Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: The patient has volume overload leading to heart failure. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance, diuretics, and oxygenation are necessary.
3. CAD/unstable angina: The patient had significant coronary artery disease and underwent stent placement. Monitoring for recurrent chest pain and adjusting antiplatelet therapy may be required.
4. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), or aspiration. Pulmonary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), and impaired skin integrity. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, dyspnea, and anemia. The patient has been receiving various medications including codeine, Vasotec, cortisporin otic, ciloxan ophthalmic, atenolol, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 112/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight is 96.5 kg. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 800 mL (total in) with an output of 2,230 mL (total out), resulting in a negative balance of 1,430 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of infection. Additionally, the use of indwelling lines and catheters can also predispose the patient to infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Fluid overload: Despite the negative fluid balance, there is still a significant amount of fluid intake compared to output, which"
