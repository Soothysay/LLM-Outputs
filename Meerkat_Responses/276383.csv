","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and previous withdrawal seizures. He presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including a seizure this morning, three days after his last drink. The patient has been experiencing tremors and is being treated with frequent doses of Valium (diazepam) to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He is also receiving IV thiamine, folate, and oral multivitamins.

The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate (105 bpm) and slightly elevated blood pressure. His oxygen saturation is within normal range (99%). The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a non-rebreather mask, and his ABG results indicate a slightly elevated carbon dioxide level.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished but anxious, with clear breath sounds and no murmurs. His extremities are absent on the right side and diminished on the left side. Neurological assessment is incomplete due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, the patient has low potassium (3.8 mEq/L) and magnesium (0.6 mg/dL) levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Plan:
1. Continue q1 hour dosing of Valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
2. Administer IV thiamine, folate, and oral multivitamins.
3. Monitor the patient's"

   suctioned, 97% on NRB.  Likely aspiration event.  CXR immediately after
   event showed no evidence of infiltrate
though was immediately after
   event.
   - NPO, change po meds to IV
   - no abx for now unless spikes
 if does, need to cover for hospital
   aquired PNA with vanc, zosyn, flagyl
   - can repeat CXR if acutely worsens

   - IV thiamine, folate, hold oral MVI
   - ICU cardiac monitoring
   # Hyponatremia:  135 this morning. Unclear cause, could be [**2-25**] to poor
   po intake vs. IV fluids.  Other ddx includes SIADH. Euvolemic on exam.
   - will start D5/NS as NPO
   # Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia: K 3.4, Mg 1.5 this morning.  Likely
   [**2-25**] to poor po intake
   - aggressive lyte repletion, monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia/Anemia - Plt 62 this morning.  Per past admissions,
   pt with anemia, HCT around 30-35. Has had thrombocytopenia, although
   this admission has been his lowest value. Most likely related to his
   chronic use. No clinical evidence to indicate hemolysis or other

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and withdrawal seizures. He presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including a seizure this morning, three days after his last drink. He also experienced hypoxia, with oxygen saturation dropping to 74% before being suctioned and placed on a non-rebreather mask. The cause of the hypoxia is likely an aspiration event, as there were copious thick secretions. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 107/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on the non-rebreather mask. 

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135 mEq/L, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.5 mg/dL. These electrolyte imbalances could be related to poor oral intake or SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion). 

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 62 K/uL and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL. These findings are likely due to his chronic alcohol use and are not indicative of hemolysis or other causes at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and previous withdrawal seizures. He presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including a seizure this morning, three days after his last drink. The patient has received a total of 220mg of valium overnight. The plan is to continue diazepam at 20-40mg orally or intravenously every hour as needed, if the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score remains above 10. Additionally, the patient will receive intravenous thiamine, folate, and oral multivitamins. He will also be monitored with ICU cardiac monitoring.

Other issues identified in the patient's progress note include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. The cause of these electrolyte imbalances is unclear, but poor oral intake and SIADH are considered as potential causes. The patient's potassium level is low at 3.4 this morning, likely due to poor oral intake. Aggressive electrolyte repletion is planned, and the patient will be monitored on telemetry. The patient's platelet count is low at 62 this morning, which is likely related to his chronic alcohol use. There is no clinical evidence of hemolysis or other etiology at this time. The patient will receive pneumoboots for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and will have daily monitoring of platelet count. Outpatient follow-up is also required."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with alcoholism and a history of withdrawal seizures. He presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal including a seizure this morning, three days after his most recent drink. The patient also experienced an acute desaturation event to 74% on RA, with copious secretions suctioned, and is currently on NRB at 97%. This likely indicates an aspiration event, although a chest X-ray immediately after the event showed no evidence of infiltrate.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's acute desaturation to 74% suggests hypoxia, possibly due to an aspiration event.

2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient exhibits signs and symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, including a recent history of alcohol use and previous withdrawal seizures. He received a total of 220mg of valium overnight.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 135 this morning, which is below the normal range. The cause of this condition is unclear, but it could be related to poor oral intake or intravenous fluids. Other potential causes include SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion).

4. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia: The patient's potassium level is 3.4, and magnesium level is 1.5 this morning. These low levels may be due to poor oral intake."

","The patient is a 45-year-old male who is admitted to the ICU for acute alcohol withdrawal, respiratory distress, and possible aspiration. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol use and presents with symptoms such as tachycardia, hypotension, diaphoresis, and respiratory distress. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on non-rebreather oxygen. 

On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented but appears to be in significant distress. The cardiovascular examination reveals sinus tachycardia, and the respiratory examination shows diffuse rhonchi. The abdominal examination is unremarkable, and the neurologic examination is grossly normal.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and thrombocytopenia. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits, but other laboratory values are pending. An imaging study shows clear lung fields, ruling out any obvious pneumonia.

The patient's plan includes treatment for alcohol withdrawal, close monitoring for signs of infection, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient will also receive nutritional support and follow-up care for esophageal stricture, previous tuberculosis, chronic liver disease, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, and their code status is full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues. They have a history of alcohol abuse and are experiencing respiratory distress, which may be due to hypoventilation, sedation, and possible aspiration. The patient also has evidence of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and requires detoxification. They have a past history of tuberculosis, but their recent chest X-ray is clear. The patient has chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia related to alcohol use and splenic sequestration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory distress, hypoventilation, and possible aspiration, there is a risk of developing pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens if not managed appropriately.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Liver Disease: The patient's chronic liver disease may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure.
5. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to alcohol abuse, making them susceptible to infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the"

   57 year-old male with alcoholism and history of withdrawal seizures who
   presents after s/sx alcohol withdrawal including seizure this morning,
   3 days after most recent drink.
   # Hypoxia:  Acutely desated to 74%on RA, had copious secretions
   suctioned, 97% on NRB.  Likely aspiration event.  CXR immediately after
   event showed no evidence of infiltrate
though was immediately after
   event.
   - NPO, change po meds to IV
   - no abx for now unless spikes
 if does, need to cover for hospital
   aquired PNA with vanc, zosyn, flagyl
   - can repeat CXR if acutely worsens
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Clinical history c/w alcohol withdrawal (recently
   stopped drinking) in pt with history of significant alcohol use and
   history of alcohol withdrawal seizures; additionally, withdrawal
   symptoms and signs with a positive alcohol level place pt at very high
   risk for DTs or further seizures.  Received total of 220mg valium
   overnight.
   - Continue CIWA scale at diazepam 20-40mg iv q1h prn CIWA >10 though
   very cautiously given respiratory event.
   - d/c po diazepam 20-40mg  po/iv q1h prn CIWA >10
   - IV thiamine, folate, hold oral MVI
   - ICU cardiac monitoring
   # Hyponatremia:  135 this morning. Unclear cause, could be [**2-25**] to poor
   po intake vs. IV fluids.  Other ddx includes SIADH. Euvolemic on exam.
   - will start D5/NS as NPO
   # Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia: K 3.4, Mg 1.5 this morning.  Likely
   [**2-25**] to poor po intake
   - aggressive lyte repletion, monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia/Anemia - Plt 62 this morning.  Per past admissions,
   pt with anemia, HCT around 30-35. Has had thrombocytopenia, although
   this admission has been his lowest value. Most likely related to his
   chronic use. No clinical evidence to indicate hemolysis or other
   etiology at this time.
   - pneumoboots for DVT PPx
   - monitor PLT count daily
   - will need outpatient follow up
   # h/o Esophageal Stricture:  Per records, had dilation in [**9-30**],
   supposed to have another one which he did not
   - s/sw eval done, but will keep pt NPO for now give likely aspiration
   event
   -out patient GI follow up
   # FEN: NPO as above, IVF as above, aggressive lyte repletion

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and withdrawal seizures. He presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal including a seizure this morning, 3 days after his last drink. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F (39.1°C), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 105/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 100% non-rebreather. 

The patient was noted to aspirate during rounds in the morning and was given intravenous fluids and antibiotics. He was also started on aztreonam, flagyl, and vancomycin due to concerns about hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's airway protection is a concern, and benzodiazepines were continued despite potential benzodiazepine intoxication. Valium was stopped, and haloperidol was given for agitation. A psychiatric consultation was recommended. 

The patient's ABG results show respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.47, PCO2 of 31 mmHg, and PO2 of 100%. The patient's arterial blood gases indicate hypoxemia. 

A PICC line was ordered, and the patient received a 1 L normal saline bolus for low urine output. The patient has allergies to penicillins and an unknown allergy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and withdrawal seizures. He presented with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal including a seizure four days ago, seven days after his last drink. On admission, the patient had hypoxia and was intubated. He was given broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a suspected aspiration event, and his condition improved with oxygen supplementation. The patient also showed signs of alcohol withdrawal, which was managed with benzodiazepines initially but had to be held due to suspected toxicity. Haloperidol was given for agitation. The patient's tachycardia resolved, but he remains intermittently delirious. He has a history of significant alcohol use and is at high risk for delirium tremens or further seizures. The patient's hyponatremia has resolved, and his hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are likely due to poor oral intake. Thrombocytopenia and anemia are chronic issues related to alcohol use. The patient has an esophageal stricture and is at risk for aspiration. He is currently NPO, receiving IV fluids, and will require outpatient follow-up. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), diazepam (Valium), and haldol. The patient's condition has stabilized, and it is planned to transfer him to the floor for further management. Potential Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, presenting with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal including seizure. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient experienced an aspiration event yesterday morning, resulting in hypoxia. He was placed on non-rebreather oxygen and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a fever spike. The patient's current condition includes delirium, tachycardia, and intermittent agitation. He is being held on haloperidol for agitation and benzodiazepine toxicity. His labs show hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient has multiple medical issues, including a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, esophageal stricture, and chronic alcohol use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event puts him at risk for developing pneumonia. The fact that he was intubated and placed on non-rebreather oxygen suggests that his respiratory status is compromised.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is a common complication in ICU patients, especially those with a history of alcohol abuse. It can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or withdrawal symptoms.
3. Seizures: The patient's history of withdrawal seizures increases his risk of having further seizures while in the ICU."

   57 year-old male with alcoholism and history of withdrawal seizures who
   presents after s/sx alcohol withdrawal including seizure on day of
   admission 4 days ago, 7 days after most recent drink.
   # Hypoxia:  Yesterday morning acutely desated to 74%on RA, had copious
   secretions suctioned, 97% on NRB.  Likely aspiration event.  CXR
   immediately after event showed no evidence of infiltrate
though was
   immediately after event.   Patient spiked to 102.4 in the afternoon and
   was started on broad spectrum abx
 aztreonam (PCN allergy), vanc and
   flagy.  Currently on NRB at 97%
   - continue vanc, flagyl and aztreonam pending cultures.
   - repeat CXR this morning unchanged from yesterday, no evidence of PNA
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - NPO
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Patient was refractory of valium yesterday
   morning, psych nursse evaluated and fle he was showing signs of benzo
   toxicity.  Valium was held and patient was written for haldol for
   agitation.  Tachycardia has resolved this morning.  Patient continues
   to be intermittently deliruous.  On admission clinical history c/w
   alcohol withdrawal (recently stopped drinking) in pt with history of
   significant alcohol use and history of alcohol withdrawal seizures;
   additionally, withdrawal symptoms and signs with a positive alcohol
   level place pt at very high risk for DTs or further seizures.
   - continue to hold valium
   - consider psych c/s for medication management
   - NPO for now
   - ICU cardiac monitoring
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved. 137 this morning. Unclear cause, could be
   [**2-25**] to poor po intake vs. IV fluids.  Other ddx includes SIADH.
   Euvolemic on exam.
   - IVF  D5NS whil NPO
   # Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia: K 3.7, Mg 1.5 this morning.  Likely
   [**2-25**] to poor po intake
   - aggressive lyte repletion, monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia/Anemia - Plt 73 this morning.  Per past admissions,
   pt with anemia, HCT around 30-35. Has had thrombocytopenia, although
   this admission has been his lowest value. Most likely related to his
   chronic alcohol use. No clinical evidence to indicate hemolysis or
   other etiology at this time.
   - pneumoboots for DVT Ppxand alteration in mental status
   - monitor PLT count daily
   - will need outpatient follow up
   # h/o Esophageal Stricture:  Per records, had dilation in [**9-30**],
   supposed to have another one which he did not

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and withdrawal seizures. He presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including a seizure on the day of admission, which occurred 7 days after his last drink. The patient also experienced hypoxia due to an aspiration event, for which he was placed on non-rebreather oxygen therapy. He has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (aztreonam, vancomycin, and flagyl) pending culture results. The patient's repeat chest X-ray remains unchanged, showing no evidence of pneumonia.

The patient is also experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms and signs, including agitation and delirium. Valium was held due to suspected benzo toxicity, and the patient was prescribed haloperidol for agitation. The patient's tachycardia has resolved, but he continues to be intermittently delirious. His sodium levels have resolved, and his potassium and magnesium levels are low, likely due to poor oral intake.

The patient has thrombocytopenia and anemia, which are likely related to chronic alcohol use. There is no clinical evidence of hemolysis or other etiology at this time. The patient's esophageal stricture requires further evaluation and outpatient follow-up.

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), receiving IV fluids, and will continue aggressive electrolyte repletion. He will be monitored closely for any changes in mental status, and a psych consult may be considered for medication"
