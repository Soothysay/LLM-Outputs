   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and cryptogenic
   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: In setting of
   altered mental status with administration of narcotics and baseline
   COPD, may have had aspiration event (pneumonia v. pneumonitis) with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Hypercarbia may be driven by
   hypoxia v. diuresis.
   - bronch today
   - abx as above
   - MDIs
   - f/u sputum cx
   - attempt to transition pt to PS today
   - daily wake up and RSBI
   .
   # ?Sepsis: Fever in absence of leukocytosis; pt remains hemodynamically
   stable. Unclear infectious v. related to albumin infusion. Concern for
   pneumonia given chest imaging
 aspiration pneumonia v. pneumonitis.
   Other infectious sources include SBP although not large amount ascites
   on CT abd as well as worsening cellulitis.
   - broad abx coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyl pending further micro
   data (blood, urine and sputum cx)
   - repeat ABG
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis
   from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less likely accumulation of
   morphine from earlier doses.
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat pna as above
   - cont lactulose for possible encephalopathy.
   - hold off on CT head or LP for now
   .
   # Anemia: dropped from 29 to 26 today, no obvious signs of bleeding.
   - guaiac stools
   - PM HCT
   .
   # Low UOP: patient does not have a foley and will likely need one now.
   - reconsult urology for foley placement.
   .
   # Lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis: Likely related to portal
   htn/cirrhosis. Long hx of inguinoscrotal hernia, now worsened by
   current volume overloaded state. Currently without dyspnea or pain.
   - demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - on broad spectrum abx as above
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic as above. Urine Na of 15 and FeNa of 0.1%
   suggest cardiac or cirrhosis as etiology.  Psyche meds include
   risperdol.
   - monitor Na Q4 hrs and aim for 0.5 mEq per hr.
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Currently intubated.
   - Cont risperdal
   - Hold ativan
   .
   # COPD: severe by PFTs in [**2155**] with FEV1 33% and FVC 51% of predicted
   - combivent nebs PRN
   .
   # Goals of care: Ex-wife, [**Name (NI) 1028**] [**Name (NI) 7142**], states that in the past he did
   not want any life saving measures, but did not want to sign anything
   due to his paranoia.  When he arrived during this hospitalization, he
   indicated he would like everything done, so his code status is full
   now.  She would like palliative care to come by in the morning to
   discuss goals of care.

   Code status: Full code, will need to confirm with wife with input from
   SW/palliative care
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca (generalized edema) and profound scrotal edema. He has been admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include pneumonia/hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, possible sepsis, altered mental status, anemia, low urine output, lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis, hyponatremia, schizophrenia, and COPD. The patient's code status is currently full code, but this needs to be confirmed with the wife and input from social work/palliative care.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever in the absence of leukocytosis raises concern for sepsis. If the infection spreads or if the patient's immune system is compromised, sepsis can develop, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or medication side effects. This can increase the risk of falls, aspiration, and difficulty"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema and has been admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has fever, progression of lung infiltrate, and respiratory decompensation, which may indicate sepsis. The source of infection is likely aspiration pneumonia due to mucous plugging. Antibiotics have been changed to vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl as recommended by the ID team.

2. Pneumonia/hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia. He is also experiencing hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to mucous plugging and volume loss. Treatment includes antibiotics, MDIs, sputum culture, bronchoscopic evaluation to relieve plugging, weaning of ventilator settings as tolerated, and daily wake-up tests for respiratory support.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is obtunded, and the cause of his altered mental status is unclear. Possible causes include sepsis from pneumonia, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or accumulation of morphine. Intubation has been performed for airway protection,"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia and acute mountain sickness (AMS). He is intubated due to hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and started on vancomycin, zosyn, and levo. The patient's ex-wife has expressed that he would want to be DNR, but he did not sign the papers due to paranoia. He has four daughters, so it is necessary to clarify who makes decisions with the help of a social worker.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 07:30 PM on 07/14/2015 and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 09:15 PM on the same day.

Infusions include propofol at 30 mcg/kg/min, famotidine (Pepcid) at 09:00 PM on 07/14/2015, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at 10:00 PM on the same day.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flowsheet data as of 07/15/2015 at 05:39 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 91 bpm (84-131), blood pressure ranging from 123/47 mmHg to 106"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), delirium/confusion, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), and peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The most likely etiology is pneumonia, but other possibilities include allergic reaction to albumin infusion or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to large fluid in the scrotum and abdomen.

2. Pneumonia/Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate with likely plugging and volume loss seen on post-intubation chest X-ray. Mucous plugging in the setting of being obtunded. Antibiotics have been started, and measures are being taken to relieve plugging.

3. Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status is unclear. It could be due to sepsis from pneumonia, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or accumulation of morphine from earlier doses. Intubation has been done for airway protection,"

   69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and cryptogenic
   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient was febrile with tachycardia and hypoxia. Most likely
   etiology is pneumonia given new infiltrates on CXR or possibly
   aspiration pneumonitis.  Also could be allergic reaction to albumin
   infusion.  With large fluid in scrotum and abd, may also be SBP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema. He was admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, pneumonia, hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, anemia, low urine output, lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis, hyponatremia, and schizophrenia. The patient's ex-wife states that he would want to be DNR but did not sign papers due to paranoia. She also mentions that he would like everything done, so his code status is now full. The patient's goals of care need to be discussed with palliative care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia suggest the possibility of sepsis. The presence of pneumonia and large fluid in the scrotum and abdomen may indicate an underlying infection.
2. Pneumonia/Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia. His respiratory failure is likely due to mucous plugging, possibly exacerbated by his altered mental status.
3. Altered Mental Status: The cause of the patient's altered mental status is unclear, but it could be related to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis, is admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and other medications such as risperdal, famotidine, and propofol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient may have had an aspiration event leading to pneumonia with subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Hypercarbia may be driven by hypoxia or diuresis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has fever in the absence of leukocytosis and remains hemodynamically stable. The source of infection could be pneumonia, SBP, or cellulitis.
3. Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status is unclear. Possible causes include sepsis from pneumonia, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or accumulation of morphine.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 29 to 26 today, without obvious signs of bleeding.

   69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and cryptogenic
   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
   multifactorial.  Patient had been aggressively diuresed on the floor
   and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2.  Also received narcotics in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Likely had aspiration event with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Sputum samples growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  On vancomycin, cefepime and
   flagyl for aspiration/hospital acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for aspiration versus
   hospital acquired pneumonia
   - continue inhalers for COPD
   - f/u speciation of sputum cultures
   - attempt to wean pressures support as tolerated
   - daily wakeups, RSBI
   .
   ?Sepsis:  On arrival to the MICU patient was febrile in the absence of
   leukocytosis with mild hypotension.  [**Month (only) 11**] well have been related to
   aspiration event.  Now hemodynamically stable and afebrile for over 24
   hours
   - broad abx coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyl pending further micro
   data (blood, urine and sputum cx)
   - can discontinue arterial line as patient is hemodynamically stable
   Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis
   from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less likely accumulation of
   morphine from earlier doses.  Intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   - treat infection as above
   - elevated bicarbonate resolving
   - continue lactulose for possible encephalopathy
   - hold off on CT head and LP for now
   Anemia: Hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission to 26
   today without obvious signs of bleeding.
   - guaiac all stools
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 21
   Low UOP:  Resolved.  Urology able to place foley catheter successfully
   yesterday for better monitoring of patient
s urine output.
   - monitor urine output
   - trend creatinine
   Lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis: Likely related to portal
   htn/cirrhosis. Long hx of inguinoscrotal hernia, now worsened by
   current volume overloaded state. Currently without dyspnea or pain.
   - demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - on broad spectrum abx as above
   Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic as above. Urine Na of 15 and FeNa of 0.1%
   suggest cardiac or cirrhosis as etiology.  Psychiatric mediactions may
   also be contributing.
   - concentrating patients medications in normal saline instead of D5W
   - sodium stable at 129 today
   - daily sodium checks
   Schizophrenia: Currently intubated.
   - Cont risperdal
   - Hold ativan
   COPD: severe by PFTs in [**2155**] with FEV1 33% and FVC 51% of predicted
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers QID
   Goals of care:  Seen by both social work and palliative care
   yesterday.  Discussion with patient
s ex-wife and children agreed that
   his ex-wife is his decision maker although no documented health care
   proxy form.  The decision was made to make the patient DNR for now and
   continue mechanical ventilation.  The decision has not been made yet
   whether to reintubate if the patient were to have respiratory failure
   post-intubation.
   - continue discussions with family regarding goals of care

   Disposition : ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has anasarca and profound scrotal edema. He is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has hypotension and mild tachycardia. Laboratory results show hyponatremia, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, delirium, impaired skin integrity, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: Despite current antibiotic therapy, the patient could develop sepsis, especially if the source of infection is not adequately treated or if there is a new infection.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can increase the risk of complications such as falls, aspiration, and worsening respiratory status.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's peripheral edema and scrotal edema increase the risk of pressure ulcers and impaired skin integrity.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen"

   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: In setting of
   altered mental status with administration of narcotics and baseline
   COPD, may have had aspiration event (pneumonia v. pneumonitis) with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Hypercarbia may be driven by
   hypoxia v. diuresis.
   - bronch today

   # ?Sepsis: Fever in absence of leukocytosis; pt remains hemodynamically
   stable. Unclear infectious v. related to albumin infusion. Concern for
   pneumonia given chest imaging
 aspiration pneumonia v. pneumonitis.
   Other infectious sources include SBP although not large amount ascites
   on CT abd as well as worsening cellulitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema and is readmitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, delirium, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia, and peripheral edema. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has been intubated for airway protection. He is also experiencing low urine output and has lower extremity edema with possible cellulitis. The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely hypervolemic in nature. He has a history of schizophrenia and severe COPD. The patient's code status is currently full, but the family wishes to discuss goals of care with palliative care. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is receiving appropriate medical interventions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock, leading to organ dysfunction and potential mortality.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can worsen if the underlying cause (pneumonia) is not effectively treated. This may result in further deterioration of oxygenation and ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction.
- He has been on mechanical ventilation since admission due to respiratory failure.
- The patient has delirium/confusion, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), and peripheral edema.
- Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/59-154/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,421 mL and output of 1,640 mL over the past 24 hours.
- The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, vancomycin, meropenem, and cefepime.
- Other medications include famotidine, and various ICU medications.
- The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- The patient's respiratory support includes a CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O.
- The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH, normal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2).
- The patient's peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic exams were not assessed.
- Radiology images were provided but not described in the note.
- The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating a concern for ongoing infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or worsening sepsis, is crucial.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Monitoring for adequate oxygenation and ventilation parameters, such as PaO2/FiO2 ratio, plateau pressure, and respiratory system compliance, is essential. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient has delirium/confusion, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients. Regular reassessment of mental status and providing appropriate sedation and pain management are important.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections. Regular turning and skin assessment are necessary.
5. Hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmol"

   Imaging:
   Portable CXR [**2157-7-15**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
   nasogastric tube and the endotracheal tube are unchanged.  Also
   unchanged is the volume loss in the right hemithorax, the mediastinal
   shift towards the right and the opacity at the right lung base that is
   likely to be caused by a combination of effusion and atelectasis.  The
   size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal.  The
   slightly increased diameter of the upper lobe vessels could indicate
   borderline overhydration.  No evidence of newly occurred focal
   parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and cryptogenic
   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
   multifactorial.  Patient had been aggressively diuresed on the floor
   and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2.  Also received narcotics in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Likely had aspiration event with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Sputum samples growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  On vancomycin, cefepime and
   flagyl for aspiration/hospital acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for hospital acquired
   pneumonia v. aspiration for 8-day course
   - continue inhalers for COPD
   - f/u speciation of sputum cultures
   - wean off supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - strict aspiration precaution
   .
   ?Sepsis:  On arrival to the MICU patient was febrile in the absence of
   leukocytosis with mild hypotension.  [**Month (only) 11**] well have been related to
   aspiration event.  Now hemodynamically stable and afebrile for over 24
   hours
   - broad abx coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyl pending further micro
   data (blood, urine, and sputum cx)
   - discontinue arterial line as patient is hemodynamically stable
   Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point, likely back at
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less
   likely accumulation of morphine from earlier doses.  Intubated for
   hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - treat infection as above
   - received seroquel
   - elevated bicarbonate resolving
   - recheck bicarb on gas
   - no need for CT head and LP for now
   Anemia: Hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission to 26
   today without obvious signs of bleeding.
   - guaiac all stools
   - active type and screen; transfusion goal < 21
   Low UOP:  Resolved.  Urology able to place foley catheter successfully
   yesterday for better monitoring of patient
s urine output.
   - monitor urine output
   - trend creatinine
   Lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis: Likely related to portal
   htn/cirrhosis. Long hx of inguinoscrotal hernia, now worsened by
   current volume overloaded state. Currently without dyspnea or pain.
   - demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - on broad spectrum abx as above
   Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic as above. Urine Na of 15 and FeNa of 0.1%
   suggest cardiac or cirrhosis as etiology.  Psychiatric mediactions may
   also be contributing.
   - concentrating patients medications in normal saline instead of D5W
   - sodium stable at 129 today
   - daily sodium checks
   - hold diuretics for now but would consider acetazolamide given bicarb
   Schizophrenia: Currently intubated.
   - Received dose of risperdal consta
   - Hold ativan
   COPD: severe by PFTs in [**2155**] with FEV1 33% and FVC 51% of predicted
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers QID
   Goals of care:  Seen by both social work and palliative care
   yesterday.  Discussion with patient
s ex-wife and children agreed that
   his ex-wife is his decision maker although no documented health care
   proxy form.  The decision was made to make the patient DNR for now and
   continue mechanical ventilation.  The decision has not been made yet
   whether to reintubate if the patient were to have respiratory failure
   post-intubation.

   Disposition : ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema and is admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes being intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. He has a nasogastric tube in place and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Other notable findings include hyponatremia, altered mental status, anemia, low urine output, lower extremity edema, and a large umbilical hernia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever and mild hypotension, which could indicate sepsis. However, he is currently hemodynamically stable and afebrile for over 24 hours.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently being treated for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. There is an ongoing risk of worsening respiratory status and possible spread of infection.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors such as sepsis, hypercarbia, encephalopathy, and medication effects. Close monitoring is required, and further evaluation may be needed to"

   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Sputum samples growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  On vancomycin, cefepime and
   flagyl for aspiration/hospital acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for aspiration versus
   hospital acquired pneumonia
   - continue inhalers for COPD
   - f/u speciation of sputum cultures
   - attempt to wean pressures support as tolerated
   - daily wakeups, RSBI
   .
   ?Sepsis:  On arrival to the MICU patient was febrile in the absence of
   leukocytosis with mild hypotension.  [**Month (only) 11**] well have been related to
   aspiration event.  Now hemodynamically stable and afebrile for over 24
   hours
   - broad abx coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyl pending further micro
   data (blood, urine and sputum cx)
   - can discontinue arterial line as patient is hemodynamically stable
   Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis
   from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less likely accumulation of
   morphine from earlier doses.  Intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   - treat infection as above
   - elevated bicarbonate resolving
   - continue lactulose for possible encephalopathy
   - hold off on CT head and LP for now
   Anemia: Hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission to 26
   today without obvious signs of bleeding.
   - guaiac all stools
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 21
   Low UOP:  Resolved.  Urology able to place foley catheter successfully
   yesterday for better monitoring of patient
s urine output.
   - monitor urine output
   - trend creatinine
   Lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis: Likely related to portal
   htn/cirrhosis. Long hx of inguinoscrotal hernia, now worsened by
   current volume overloaded state. Currently without dyspnea or pain.
   - demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - on broad spectrum abx as above
   Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic as above. Urine Na of 15 and FeNa of 0.1%
   suggest cardiac or cirrhosis as etiology.  Psychiatric mediactions may
   also be contributing.
   - concentrating patients medications in normal saline instead of D5W
   - sodium stable at 129 today
   - daily sodium checks
   Schizophrenia: Currently intubated.
   - Cont risperdal
   - Hold ativan
   COPD: severe by PFTs in [**2155**] with FEV1 33% and FVC 51% of predicted
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers QID
   Goals of care:  Seen by both social work and palliative care
   yesterday.  Discussion with patient
s ex-wife and children agreed that
   his ex-wife is his decision maker although no documented health care
   proxy form.  The decision was made to make the patient DNR for now and
   continue mechanical ventilation.  The decision has not been made yet
   whether to reintubate if the patient were to have respiratory failure
   post-intubation.
   - continue discussions with family regarding goals of care

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema, and was readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS).
3. Delirium/confusion.
4. Impaired skin integrity.
5. Hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality).
6. Edema, peripheral.

Assessment and Plan:
- Continue vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for aspiration versus hospital-acquired pneumonia.
- Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerated.
- Daily wakeups, respiratory system assessment with blood gas (ABG) analysis.
- Treat infection with broad antibiotic coverage.
- Monitor urine output.
- Trend creatinine.
- Monitor for extension of erythema in lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis.
- On broad spectrum antibiotics.
- Concentrating patient's medications in normal saline instead of D5W.
- Sodium stable at 129 today.
- Daily sodium checks.
- Continue inhalers for COPD.
- Follow up on sputum cultures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, pneumonia, cirrhosis, and schizophrenia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoventilatory respiratory failure, possible sepsis, and obtundation. The patient's condition has improved since admission, with successful extubation this morning. However, he is still refusing PICC placement. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI. He has multiple comorbidities, including lower body edema, RV failure, and portal hypertension. His current plan includes treating for possible infection, minimizing sedatives, and providing supportive care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoventilatory respiratory failure: The patient has underlying COPD and possible pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory function.
2. Possible sepsis: The patient has been broadly covered with antibiotics for suspected sources of infection, including pneumonia and lower extremity cellulitis.
3. Lower body edema: The edema may be due to RV failure and portal hypertension, increasing the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Downtrending Hct: The patient's hematocrit levels are decreasing, indicating possible ongoing bleeding or fluid shifts. Further evaluation with serial Hct and guaiacs is recommended.
5. Hypercapnia: The patient's elevated carbon dioxide levels may contribute to obtundation and should be"

   Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
   multifactorial.  Patient had been aggressively diuresed on the floor
   and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2.  Also received narcotics in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Likely had aspiration event with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Sputum samples growing gram

   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for hospital acquired
   pneumonia v. aspiration for 8-day course
   - continue inhalers for COPD
   - f/u speciation of sputum cultures
   - wean off supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - strict aspiration precaution

   - demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - on broad spectrum abx as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema, and is re-admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, delirium/confusion, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia, and peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever and mild hypotension suggests possible sepsis. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a concern for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to various factors including sepsis, hypercarbia, or medication effects.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has profound scrotal edema and anasarca, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and skin breakdown.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has low serum sodium levels, indicating hyponatremia. This can lead to neurological symptoms"

   69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and cryptogenic
   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
   multifactorial.  Patient had been aggressively diuresed on the floor
   and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2.  Also received narcotics in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Likely had aspiration event with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Sputum samples growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  On vancomycin, cefepime and
   flagyl for aspiration/hospital acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for hospital acquired
   pneumonia v. aspiration for 8-day course
   - continue inhalers for COPD
   - f/u speciation of sputum cultures
   - wean off supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - strict aspiration precaution
   - discontinue arterial line as patient is hemodynamically stable
   Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point, likely back at
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less
   likely accumulation of morphine from earlier doses.  Intubated for
   hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, but now extubated.
   - treat infection as above
   - received seroquel
   - elevated bicarbonate resolving
   - recheck bicarb on gas
   - no need for CT head and LP for now
   Anemia: Hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission without
   obvious signs of bleeding.
   - guaiac all stools
   - active type and screen; transfusion goal < 21
   Low UOP:  Resolved.  Urology able to place foley catheter successfully
   yesterday for better monitoring of patient
s urine output.
   - monitor urine output
   - trend creatinine
   Lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis: Likely related to portal
   htn/cirrhosis. Long hx of inguinoscrotal hernia, now worsened by
   current volume overloaded state. Currently without dyspnea or pain.
   - demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - on broad spectrum abx as above
   Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic as above. Urine Na of 15 and FeNa of 0.1%
   suggest cardiac or cirrhosis as etiology.
   - concentrating patients medications in normal saline instead of D5W
   - sodium stable at 130 today
   - daily sodium checks
   - hold diuretics for now but would consider acetazolamide given bicarb
   Schizophrenia: Currently appropriate.
   - Received dose of risperdal consta
   - Hold ativan
   COPD: severe by PFTs in [**2155**] with FEV1 33% and FVC 51% of predicted

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema, and is admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, delirium/confusion, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), and peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient had hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilation, but was successfully extubated. Monitoring the patient's oxygenation status and ensuring adequate ventilation is crucial.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status is altered, and the etiology is unclear. It is important to address any underlying causes such as infection, hypercarbia, or medication effects. Ensuring adequate pain control and implementing non-pharmacological interventions can also help manage delirium.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has evidence of impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of infections. Close monitoring of the skin and implementation of appropriate wound care measures are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoventilatory respiratory failure, possibly due to underlying COPD and opiate intoxication. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable. He has been successfully extubated and is being treated for pneumonia. The patient also has possible sepsis, likely due to pneumonia, and is at high risk for recurrent aspiration. He is being closely monitored for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoventilatory respiratory failure, which has since resolved. However, he has underlying COPD and may be at risk for recurrent respiratory failure if his respiratory reserve is compromised.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for pneumonia, which could lead to complications such as worsening lung infection, septic shock, or respiratory distress.
3. Sepsis: The patient has possible sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not appropriately managed.
4. Recurrent Aspiration: The patient is at high risk for recurrent aspiration due to his respiratory condition and possible impaired swallowing mechanics.
5. Lower Body Edema: The patient has lower body edema, which could be multifactorial in origin, including right ventricular failure and portal hypertension. This could lead to complications such as decreased venous return, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema.
6. Schizophrenia: The patient has a history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. He has since been extubated successfully. The patient's main concerns include hypoventilatory respiratory failure, possible pneumonia, potential sepsis due to pneumonia, high risk for recurrent aspiration, and lower body edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoventilatory respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD, which increases the risk of hypoventilation. This condition can lead to decreased oxygen levels in the blood and carbon dioxide buildup, potentially causing respiratory acidosis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, along with the presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggest pneumonia. If left untreated, pneumonia can worsen and lead to sepsis.
3. Sepsis: Given the patient's potential pneumonia, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
4. Recurrent aspiration: The patient's risk for recurrent aspiration is high due to hypoventilatory respiratory failure,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. The patient presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema and is re-admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient has been aggressively diuresed on the floor, resulting in rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2 levels. This likely led to a multifactorial pneumonia/hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient received narcotics in the setting of altered mental status and had an aspiration event with subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Sputum samples grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient also has altered mental status, possibly due to sepsis from pneumonia, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or accumulation of morphine. The patient was intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure but is now extubated.

Other medical issues mentioned in the note include anemia, low urine output, lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis, hyponatremia, and schizophrenia. The patient's COPD is severe, with FEV1 at 33% and FVC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's medical history includes respiratory failure, delirium, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, and peripheral edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications through various lines, including a PICC line and a 22-gauge line. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low sodium level. The patient's kidney function is normal, but there are indications of impaired skin integrity. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and ABG results indicate respiratory failure. The patient's neurological status is not fully assessed. The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis progression: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis without organ dysfunction requires ongoing vigilance to prevent further deterioration and progression to septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure exacerbation: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and cryptogenic
   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
   multifactorial.  Patient had been aggressively diuresed on the floor
   and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2.  Also received narcotics in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Likely had aspiration event with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Sputum samples grew
   oropharyngeal flora.  On vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for
   aspiration/hospital acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia v.
   aspiration for 8-day course to end on [**2157-7-21**]
   - continue spiriva
   - chest PT, flutter valve
   - wean off supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - strict aspiration precaution
   Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point, likely back at
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less
   likely accumulation of morphine from earlier doses.  Intubated for
   hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, but now extubated.
   - treat infection as above
   - elevated bicarbonate resolving
   - if elevated bicarb an issue during diuresis, would try acetazolimide
   Anemia: Hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission, now
   stable without obvious signs of bleeding.
   - monitor
   Low UOP:  Resolved.  Urology able to place foley catheter successfully
   yesterday for better monitoring of patient
s urine output.
   - monitor urine output
   - trend creatinine
   Lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis: Likely related to portal
   htn/cirrhosis. Long hx of inguinoscrotal hernia, now worsened by
   current volume overloaded state. Currently much improved
   - demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - on broad spectrum abx as above
   Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic as above. Urine Na of 15 and FeNa of 0.1%
   suggest cardiac or cirrhosis as etiology.
   - concentrating patients medications in normal saline instead of D5W
   - sodium stable at 133 today
   - daily sodium checks
   - hold diuretics for now but pulmonary recommendation would consider
   acetazolamide given bicarb
   Schizophrenia: Currently appropriate.
   - Received dose of risperdal consta
   - Hold ativan
   COPD: severe by PFTs in [**2155**] with FEV1 33% and FVC 51% of predicted
   - tiotroprium
   - albuterol nebulizers QID
   Leukopenia: Unclear etiology for downtrending WBC. Is 5-days into abx
   course.
   - Discontinue vanc given neg MRSA screen
   - Add diff
   Inguinal Hernia: Will need to readdress ?repair once acute issues
   resolved.
   Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patch
   Goals of care:  Seen by both social work and palliative care.  Patient
   signed HCP form making ex-wife HCP.  [**Name (NI) **] is now DNR and OK to reintubate
   if the patient were to have respiratory failure post-extubation.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, delirium, impaired skin integrity, hyponatremia, and peripheral edema. The patient has a history of profound scrotal swelling, extensive erythema over the legs, diminished breath sounds bilaterally, and a large umbilical hernia. Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/70 to 91/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 90%, and temperature within normal limits. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1690 mL, output of 1860 mL, with a negative balance of -170 mL. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, and is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient is currently diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. However, there is a risk of progression to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if the infection is not adequately controlled.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can worsen if lung function deteriorates further. There is a risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the ongoing infection and potential lung injury.
3. Delirium: The patient exhibits delirium, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He was readmitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient previously had hypoventilatory respiratory failure, which resolved due to underlying COPD and possible opiate intoxication. He was successfully extubated three days ago.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Possible pneumonia: The patient's bronch specimens are being followed up, and he is being treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime.
2. Possible sepsis: The patient is at high risk for recurrent aspiration. Broadly covered with vancomycin and cefepime, currently on day 5 of 8.
3. Consider formal swallow evaluation.
4. Downtrending Hct: The patient's hematocrit is stable for two days.
5. Schizophrenia: Risperidone is given every two weeks.
6. Lower body edema: This is likely multifactorial with right ventricular failure and portal hypertension. Eventually, continued diuresis will be considered once the patient is more hemodynamically stable.

The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema and was admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient had hypoventilatory respiratory failure, which resolved, related to underlying COPD and possible opiate intoxication. He also had right lower lobe pneumonia. He was successfully extubated three days ago and is currently on day 5 of an 8-day course of cefepime for pneumonia treatment.

Medical Complications:
1. Leukopenia: The patient has a decreasing white blood cell count, which may be related to medications. Neutropenic precautions are being taken.
2. Possible sepsis: The patient is at high risk for recurrent aspiration and has been broadly covered with cefepime for possible pneumonia-related sepsis. A follow-up culture data will be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and cryptogenic
   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
   multifactorial.  Patient had been aggressively diuresed on the floor
   and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2.  Also received narcotics in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Likely had aspiration event with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Flagyl discontinued [**7-17**], vanc
   discontinued [**7-18**] for leucopenia. Sputum cx now growing S. pneumo.
   - Continue cefepime for HAP v. aspiration PNA; 8-day course to end on
   [**2157-7-21**]
   - Continue spiriva
   - Chest PT, acapella valve
   - Wean off supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - Strict aspiration precaution
   Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis
   from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less likely accumulation of
   morphine from earlier doses.  Intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, but now extubated. MS likely back to baseline.
   - treating infection as above
   - elevated bicarbonate resolving
   - if elevated bicarb an issue during diuresis, would try acetazolimide
   Anemia: Hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission, now
   stable without obvious signs of bleeding.
   - Monitor
   Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic as above. Urine Na of 15 and FeNa of 0.1%
   suggest cirrhosis as etiology given unremarkable TTE.
   - Concentrating patients medications in normal saline instead of D5W
   - Daily sodium checks
   - Hold diuretics for now but would consider acetazolamide given high
   bicarb
   Lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis: Likely related to portal
   HTN/cirrhosis. Long hx of inguinoscrotal hernia, now worsened by
   current volume overloaded state. Currently much improved
   - Demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - On broad spectrum abx as above
   - Likely will need general surgery consult for inguinoscrotal hernia,
   which has now worsened.
   Schizophrenia: Currently appropriate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presented with anasarca and profound scrotal edema and was readmitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been aggressively diuresed, resulting in rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2 levels. He also received narcotics in the setting of altered mental status and likely had an aspiration event with subsequent plugging and lobar collapse.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including pneumonia, hypoxia, and hypercarbia. The pneumonia is suspected to be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, as indicated by the sputum culture.
2. Altered mental status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status is unclear. It could be due to sepsis from pneumonia, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or accumulation of morphine from earlier doses.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission, but there are no obvious signs of bleeding.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hypervolemic hyponatremia, likely due to cirrhosis. The urine sodium of 15 and fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and cryptogenic
   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
   multifactorial.  Patient had been aggressively diuresed on the floor
   and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2.  Also received narcotics in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Likely had aspiration event with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Flagyl discontinued [**7-17**], vanc
   discontinued [**7-18**] for leucopenia. Sputum cx now growing S. pneumo.
   - Continue cefepime for HAP v. aspiration PNA; 8-day course to end on
   [**2157-7-21**]
   - Continue spiriva
   - Chest PT, acapella valve
   - Wean off supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - Strict aspiration precaution
   Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis
   from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less likely accumulation of
   morphine from earlier doses.  Intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, but now extubated. MS likely back to baseline.
   - treating infection as above
   - elevated bicarbonate resolving
   - if elevated bicarb an issue during diuresis, would try acetazolimide
   Anemia: Hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission, now
   stable without obvious signs of bleeding.
   - Monitor
   Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic as above. Urine Na of 15 and FeNa of 0.1%
   suggest cirrhosis as etiology given unremarkable TTE.
   - Concentrating patients medications in normal saline instead of D5W
   - Daily sodium checks
   - Hold diuretics for now but would consider acetazolamide given high
   bicarb
   Lower extremity edema/possible cellulitis: Likely related to portal
   HTN/cirrhosis. Long hx of inguinoscrotal hernia, now worsened by
   current volume overloaded state. Currently much improved
   - Demarcated both legs -> monitor for extension of erythema
   - On broad spectrum abx as above
   - Likely will need general surgery consult for inguinoscrotal hernia,
   which has now worsened.
   Schizophrenia: Currently appropriate.
   - Received q2 week dose of risperdal consta on [**2157-7-15**]
   - Holding ativan
   COPD: severe by PFTs in [**2155**] with FEV1 33% and FVC 51% of predicted

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema. He was readmitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been aggressively diuresed on the floor and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2. He received narcotics in the setting of altered mental status and likely had an aspiration event with subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. The sputum culture is growing S. pneumoniae.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in origin. This condition requires immediate medical attention and management.

2. Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status is unclear at this point. It could be due to sepsis from pneumonia, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or accumulation of morphine from earlier doses. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission, now stable without obvious signs of bleeding. Regular monitoring is required.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hypervolemic hyponatremia, likely secondary to cirrhosis. Urine sodium of "

   cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema now
   re-admitted to MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Pneumonia/ hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
   multifactorial.  Patient had been aggressively diuresed on the floor
   and had rising serum bicarbonate and PCO2.  Also received narcotics in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Likely had aspiration event with
   subsequent plugging and lobar collapse. Flagyl discontinued [**7-17**], vanc
   discontinued [**7-18**] for leucopenia. Sputum cx now growing S. pneumo.

   Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] be sepsis
   from pna, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or less likely accumulation of
   morphine from earlier doses.  Intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, but now extubated. MS likely back to baseline.
   - treating infection as above
   - elevated bicarbonate resolving

   suggest cirrhosis as etiology given unremarkable TTE.
   - Concentrating patients medications in normal saline instead of D5W
   - 1.5 liter fluid restriction
   - Daily sodium checks
   - Hold diuretics for now but would consider acetazolamide on the floor

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is multifactorial, including pneumonia, hypoxia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, and potential aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae in his sputum culture, indicating a bacterial infection. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated with levofloxacin.
2. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure but has since been extubated. Continuous oxygen supplementation and weaning off supplemental oxygen as tolerated are planned.
3. Altered mental status: The etiology of the altered mental status is unclear and requires further evaluation. Possible causes include sepsis from pneumonia, encephalopathy, hypercarbia, or accumulation of morphine.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has slowly trended down from 33 on admission, now stable without obvious signs of bleeding. Monitoring is recommended.

","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema and is re-admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. He has S. pneumonia pneumonia and is being treated with cefepime and levofloxacin. His COPD is stable, but he requires incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet due to sputum production. 

The patient has leukopenia, which is resolving now that vancomycin has been discontinued. He is on risperidone for schizophrenia, and his lower body edema is likely multifactorial with right ventricular failure and portal hypertension. He will require continued diuresis. Additionally, he has large inguinal hernias causing scrotal edema and will need a surgical opinion.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
- Heart rate: 80 bpm (normal range: 70-102 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 111/49 mmHg (normal range: 64-132/34-81 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-41 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on nasal cannula
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate cancer, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presents with anasarca and profound scrotal edema. He was readmitted to the MICU for pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with S. pneumonia pneumonia and is currently being treated with levofloxacin. The patient also has leukopenia, which is resolving since the discontinuation of vancomycin. His schizophrenia is being managed with risperidone. The patient's lower body edema is believed to be multifactorial, likely due to right ventricular failure and portal hypertension. Surgical opinion is needed for his large inguinal hernia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by S. pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, the infection could worsen, leading to further respiratory distress or systemic complications.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure. If his oxygenation status deteriorates or if he develops further lung complications, he may require advanced respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.
3. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which is resolving now that vancomycin has been discontinued. However, if leukopenia persists or worsens, it could increase the risk of infections.
4. Lower Body Edema: The patient"
