","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. The patient's current condition includes stable ventricular tachycardia, controlled hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient is being treated with various medications including amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia, ezetimibe for CAD, lisinopril for hypertension, and metoprolol tartrate for cardiovascular management. Additionally, the patient is receiving furosemide for fluid management, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/68 to 140/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs and a palpable mass over the site of a previous abdominal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) site.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 189 K/uL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). He has been experiencing recurrent VT despite being on multiple anti-tachycardic medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he appears chronically ill and fatigued. Physical examination reveals a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border and over the mitral area. The patient has crackles bilaterally at the bases of the lungs and a palpable mass over the site of a previous abdominal ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) site.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of refractory VT, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. There is a risk of further arrhythmias occurring.
2. Heart failure: The patient's history of CHF indicates compromised cardiac function. Fluid overload or worsening heart failure symptoms may develop if fluid balance is not managed properly.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to indwelling lines and the immunocompromised state associated with chronic illness and ICU stay. Prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis have been initiated.
4. Gastrointestinal intolerance: The patient has experienced GI intolerance with quinidine,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). He has been admitted to the ICU for ongoing management of his VT, which has been refractory to anti-tachycardic pacing. The patient has been on multiple medications including amiodarone, mexilitine, and lidocaine, but continues to experience recurrent VT. He is also intolerant to statins and lisinopril due to gastrointestinal upset. His current vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient appears chronically ill and fatigued but is not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally at the bases of the lungs, a palpable mass over the site of a previous abdominal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) site, and blue toes with intact sensation and good capillary refill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT appears to be refractory to current treatment options, which may lead to further complications if not adequately managed.
2. Gastrointestinal intolerance: The patient has experienced GI upset with previous medications, which can increase the risk of complications such as nausea, vomiting,"

   # Ventricular Tachycardia: appears that patient has failed several drug
   regemins, and options are limited due to his tolerance of medications
   as well as the multiple foci of excitable ventricular myocardium. Was
   recently on quinidine/mexilitine, but quinidine was discontinued due to
   GI intolerance. Had breakthrough VT on mexilitine on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **]. It appears he was loaded on amiodarone IV and continued on
   mexilitine on discharge along with 200mg amiodarone, but continues to
   have VT, apparently refractory to his anti-tachycardic pacing.  EP
   evaluation considered unlikely to respond well to further ablation, but
   would be facilitated by 12 lead during v-tach event.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. He was admitted to the ICU due to breakthrough ventricular tachycardia despite being on multiple anti-tachycardic medications. The patient tolerated amiodarone IV and continued on mexilitine on discharge. However, he continues to have episodes of VT, which appear refractory to anti-tachycardic pacing. An electrophysiology (EP) evaluation considered him unlikely to respond well to further ablation but may benefit from 12-lead monitoring during v-tach events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's VT seems to be resistant to current treatment regimens, posing a significant risk of cardiac arrhythmia and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Thrombophlebitis: The patient has developed superficial left arm thrombophlebitis, which could potentially lead to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
3. Gastrointestinal Intolerance: The patient has experienced nausea and gastrointestinal upset with some medications, indicating a potential risk of further GI complications such as gastritis, ulcers, or drug-induced liver injury.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show variations, indicating a potential risk of hypotension, especially during episodes of VT or when receiving certain medications.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates an overall negative balance, suggesting a potential risk of dehydration or electrolyte imbalances."

   Echo: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**11-14**] %). The estimated cardiac index
   is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). with depressed free wall contractility.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. There is
   a small vegetation (0.5x0.4cm^2) 0n the mitral annuloplasty ring (clip
   [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-9-23**], the left
   ventricular function is worse. There is possibly a small vegetation on
   the mitral annuloplasty ring. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation
   has decreased.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient has grown Gram-positive cocci in chains within 14 hours and has a growth from the right upper extremity wound culture. He required intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and placement of an arterial line. His central venous pressure (CVP) is overestimated due to severe tricuspid regurgitation, with a goal of around 20. The patient's lactate levels are improving, and he has been taken off the vasopressors with improved blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is needed.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to hypoperfusion during sepsis. This has resulted in hyperkalemia and acidosis. The patient is starting to produce more urine, indicating some improvement.

3. Acidosis - anion gap, non-anion gap, and respiratory alkalosis: The patient's lactic acid levels were elevated but are now improving. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.36, so no bicarbonate has been given.

   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. There is
   a small vegetation (0.5x0.4cm^2) 0n the mitral annuloplasty ring (clip
   [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-9-23**], the left
   ventricular function is worse. There is possibly a small vegetation on
   the mitral annuloplasty ring. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation
   has decreased.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and other related conditions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9Â°C
- Heart rate: 70 bpm
- Blood pressure: 135/70 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97%
- Heart rhythm: A paced

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally at the bases of the lungs, a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border (LLSB) and over the mitral area, and a palpable mass over the site of a previous abdominal ICD site. The patient's toe is noted to be blue, but with good capillary refill and intact sensation, without pain.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), lactate, creatinine, and potassium. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range. Other laboratory values, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and electrolytes, are also provided.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. He was admitted with sepsis caused by MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus from a right upper extremity wound culture. The patient required intensive care unit (ICU) admission for fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and central venous catheter placement. He was initially treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin but then transitioned to monotherapy with vancomycin based on culture results. The patient's condition improved over 24 hours, and he was weaned off vasopressors. An echocardiogram showed a small vegetation on the mitral annuloplasty ring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis due to MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus infections. This condition required aggressive treatment with antibiotics and supportive care in the ICU.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient developed acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion during sepsis. This led to complications such as hyperkalemia, acidosis, and elevated troponin levels. The patient is being monitored for urine output and creatinine levels.
3. Acidosis: The patient had anion gap, non-anion gap, and respiratory alkalosis. However, the AB"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. He presented to the ICU with sepsis, which was initially treated with intravenous fluids, pressors, and antibiotics. The patient required an arterial line, central venous pressure monitoring, and a temporary pacemaker due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and AV conduction prolongation.

The patient's lactate levels improved over 24 hours, and he was successfully weaned off pressors. An echocardiogram revealed a small vegetation on the mitral annuloplasty ring. The patient will likely need six weeks of intravenous vancomycin.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure due to hypoperfusion during sepsis. His serum creatinine is stable, and he is making more urine. Acidosis is present, but the anion gap is closing, and the respiratory alkalosis has resolved.

The patient's ventricular tachycardia is well controlled with medications, and he does not have any recent episodes. He is currently on Zetia for CAD, ASA, and holding beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient's recent events include being seen by an infectious disease specialist who recommended a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) at a later date, an interventional radiologist for hematoma drainage, and vascular surgery regarding thrombophlebitis. The patient has been experiencing a cough for two weeks and now presents with positional expiratory wheezes at the neck.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 150/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His temperature is within normal range.

The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 22 mmHg, with fluid intake and output balanced. He is receiving respiratory support but not on supplemental oxygen. His ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with an increased CO2 level.

Physical examination reveals moist mucosal membranes, crackles at the right base, expiratory wheezes diffusely, and firmness and cord felt in the left antecubital area. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. He has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of MRSA sepsis and endocarditis of the mitral valve.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/74 to 163/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination reveals belabored breathing, crackles at the bases of the lungs, a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border and over the mitral area, and a palpable mass over the site of a previous abdominal ICD placement.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate levels, elevated creatinine levels, and low platelet count. Coagulation parameters including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) are also abnormal.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin for MRSA sepsis and endocarditis, furosemide for congestive heart failure, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. He is currently being treated for MRSA sepsis and endocarditis of the MR ring. The patient has been off pressors, and his lactate levels have improved. The likely source of infection is left arm thrombophlebitis. The patient is also experiencing respiratory issues with expiratory upper airway wheezes and bilateral basal crackles. His renal function is compromised, leading to acute on chronic renal failure due to hypoperfusion during sepsis. The patient has an acidosis with a closed anion gap and a decreased bicarbonate level. He is on multiple medications for his conditions, including anticoagulants, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and cardiovascular medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA Sepsis and endocarditis: The patient is currently being treated for MRSA sepsis and endocarditis of the MR ring. The source of infection seems to be left arm thrombophlebitis. There is a potential risk of complications associated with MRSA infection, such as septic emboli, heart valve damage, and systemic inflammation.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient has expiratory upper airway wheezes and bilateral basal crackles. These findings suggest possible respiratory distress or obstruction"

   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1335**]
   - CXR to r/o infectious source for respiratory discomfort
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Due to hypoperfusion during sepsis,
   now improving
   # Ventricular Tachycardia:
   - No episodes, stable on Mexiletine and Amio, beta-blocker
   - Avoiding Compazine for GI intolerance, on Zofran.
   - If goes into VT, give lidocaine 50-100mg bolus then [**1-26**]/min gtt.
   # CAD: On Zetia (intolerant of statins), ASA
   - On Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
   - Would continue to hold ACEi given renal function
   # Hypertension: S BB but holding Lasix and ACEi until renal function
   stabilizes.
   # DM: RISS
   # UE DVT: confirmed by US, already anticoagulated on coumadin. [**Month (only) 60**] have
   to increase length of Abx treatment if endovascular infection.
   # Abdominal Hematoma: Will hold off on draining based on improvement.
   # Mental status changes: Likely ICY delirium.  Will call out today.
   Would give zyprexa if necessary.
   # FEN: HH, no IVF, lytes prn. NPO for EGD

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis and endocarditis. The patient is currently stable on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis and endocarditis. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has expiratory upper airway wheezes and bilateral basal crackles. This suggests possible respiratory distress or infection. Nebulizer treatment and Lasix have been ordered to address this issue.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure due to hypoperfusion during sepsis. Renal function is improving, but the patient is currently on furosemide (Lasix) for volume status management.

3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of refractory ventricular tachycardia, which is currently being managed with medications such as mexiletine and amiodarone. It is important to monitor the patient for any episodes of VT and treat accordingly.

4. Thrombophlebitis: The patient likely has thrombophlebitis in the left arm, as it is suspected to be the source of MRSA sepsis. Cultures and appropriate treatment"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o man with CAD, CHF, and refractory ventricular tachycardia
   # MRSA Sepsis and endocarditis of MR ring: Treated with Vancomycin, now
   off pressors, IVF. Lactate improved.
   - Likely source left arm thrombophlebitis,
   - Daily EKGs
   - TEE on Mon, NPO Sunday night
   - will likely need 6 weeks of IV Vanc
   # Resp status
 expiratory upper airway wheezes, bilateral basal
   crackles
   - Good oxygen saturations
   - Neb treatment and Lasix 80mg IV x 1 today.
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Due to hypoperfusion during sepsis,
   now improving
   # Ventricular Tachycardia:
   - No episodes, stable on Mexiletine and Amio
   - Avoiding Compazine for GI intolerance, on Zofran.
   - If goes into VT, give lidocaine 50-100mg bolus then [**1-26**]/min gtt.
   # CAD: On Zetia (intolerant of statins), ASA
   - On Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
   - Would continue to hold ACEi given renal function
   # Hypertension: S BB but holding Lasix and ACEi until renal function
   stabilizes.
   # DM: RISS
   # UE DVT: confirmed by US, already anticoagulated on coumadin. [**Month (only) 60**] have
   to increase length of Abx treatment if endovascular infection.
   - Monitor
   # Abdominal Hematoma: Will hold off on draining based on improvement.
   # FEN: HH, no IVF, lytes prn
   # ppx: hep SQ, PO PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and refractory ventricular tachycardia. The patient was admitted with MRSA sepsis and endocarditis of the mitral ring, which has been treated with vancomycin. The patient is currently off pressors and intravenous fluids (IVF). The likely source of infection is left arm thrombophlebitis.

The patient's respiratory status is stable with good oxygen saturations, but there are expiratory upper airway wheezes and bilateral basal crackles. Nebulizer treatment and Lasix 80mg IV were given today.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure due to hypoperfusion during sepsis, which is now improving. The patient is stable on mexiletine and amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia. Compazine was avoided due to GI intolerance, and the patient is now on Zofran. If the patient goes into VT, a lidocaine 50-100mg bolus followed by [**1-26**]/min gtt should be administered.

The patient has a history of CAD and is on Zetia (intolerant of statins), ASA, Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], and will continue to hold ACE inhibitors given renal function. The patient also has hypertension,"
