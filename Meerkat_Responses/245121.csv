   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - optimize ventilator settings (decrease PEEP, change pressure support)
   to increase minute ventilation in order to maintain appropriate
   acid/base balance
   - Diurese via hemodialysis
   - continue abx tx with vancomycin and meropenem for PNA
   - daily vancomycin level, therapeutic today
   - optimize immunosuppression per BMT
   - consider IVIG, was treated with course of Rituxan
   - continue antiviral [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - patient may need tissue biopsy if still unclear etiology and fevers
   recur
   - ID on board, appreciate recs
   # New rash
 may be drug rash vs viral vs GVHD of skin
   - minimize new meds
   - derm consult requested, await recs.
   # Acidosis
   - Patient has a pure anion gap acidosis with appropriate respiratory
   compensation. His delta gap/delta bicarb is appropriate and does not
   indicate a secondary metabolic alkalosis or NAG metabolic acidosis.
   - this is all attributable to lactic acidosis which is also likely
   multifactorial due to increased metabolic rate, the acidosis itself
   along with respiratory alkalosis
   - liver disease may also contribute to decreased lactate clearance
   - continue hemodialysis
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   .
   # Acute renal failure
   - baseline 1.1
   - BK viral load is pending, if this comes back elevated likely
   contributing to current state
   - medications may be contributing to worsening renal fxn.
   - confirmed dense ATN based on urine sediment showwing muddy brown
   casts, ? hypotensive episodes
   - continue HD, goal I/O today -1L
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   # Liver failure
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if active signs bleeding
   - treat underlying PTLD
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia
   - patient has been running 110-120s since admission 10 days ago, now in
   130s-140s
   - small effusion on TTE 3 days ago, normal pulsus
   - if becomes hypotensive or difficult to ventilate will plan on repeat
   TTE
   - V/Q scan showed low-moderate probability for PE, but given pt
s high
   pre-test probability for PE, will check LENIs for eval for DVTs. Will
   hold off on CTA for now given renal failure/ no anticoagulation for
   now.
   - tx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/caspo for presumed pneumonia and empiric
   treatment, given new rash and fever, may be pre-septic.
   - TSH 2.8 on [**2137-6-3**]
   - check u/a
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse 2 units pack red cells now
   and then for hct<21 or if he needs any volume
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   .
   # Myeloma/PTLD
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 20mg IV daily
   - continue valganciclovir 450mg PO twice a week
   - f/u BMT recs regarding adjustment in medications
   .
   # Bicytopenia
   - transfuse plt<10, hct<21
   - guaic all stools
   - likely malignancy related

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of tachypnea. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to increased work of breathing. The patient has undergone several medical interventions, including the placement of a tunneled (Hickman) line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter.

The patient's fever has been persistent, with a highest recorded temperature of 103.4°F (39.7°C). The patient's blood cultures have been obtained, and he is currently receiving antibiotics, including caspofungin, vancomycin, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 144 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/53 to 130/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: flowsheet data indicates a positive fluid balance of -450 mL since 12 AM, mixed venous oxygen saturation at 87%, and a total input/output balance of 2,553 mL (696 mL input, 1,754 mL output, and 3 mL urine output).

The patient's physical examination reveals anasarca, jaundice, coarse upper airway sounds, mild crackles anteriorly, mildly distended abdomen, soft and non-tender to"

   Imaging: CXR:  bilateral effusions. Possible RUL and LLL infiltrates,
   Interstitial and alveolar edema. ETT too high.
   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure
   2) Acute Renal Failure
   3) Liver Failure
   4) Metabolic Acidosis
   5) Anemia
   6) Tachycardia
   Patient with high minute ventilation and only mildly reduced PaCO2
   consistent with increased alveolar dead space. Patient with increased
   A-a gradient. Likely has volume overload leading to problems with gas
   exchange. Not clear that there is a superimposed infection now,
   althought the patchy RUL infiltrate could be an infectious process.
   Continue present antibiotics. Needs to be volume negative with
   dialysis. With persistent tachycardia and low-moderate probability
   perfusion scan, I would obtain LENI's to assess for DVT. Avoid CTA for
   now given renal failure. INR up due to liver failure. AutoPEEP 5.3 this
   AM. Will reduce PEEP on vent to 7; see if oxygenation holds.
   Acute renal failure felt to be due to ATN at this time. Continues on
   dialsysis. Anion gap acidosis persists. Mild hyperkalemia persists.
   Treatment for lymphoma initiated.
   Hct acceptable today. Plateley count low. Neither requires transfusion
   at this time.
   Anion gap acidosis probably due to renal failure; as liver failure
   progresses, may develop lactic acidosis if problems with clearing of
   lactate.
   Rash concerning for drug reaction. Consider removing rapimmune.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxemia, indicating inadequate oxygenation. The patient's ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 184, suggesting severe hypoxemia. The chest X-ray reveals bilateral effusions and possible infiltrates in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe, indicating potential lung infection or fluid accumulation. The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels (4.6-3.6 mg/dL) and decreased urine output (<1 L on diuretics). The patient is on dialysis to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate abnormalities, including an elevated bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - optimize ventilator settings (match pt
s auto PEEP, increase RR to
   the extent that it doesn
t create so much peak insp pressure to avoid
   barotrauma), to increase minute ventilation in order to maintain
   appropriate acid/base balance
   - Diurese via hemodialysis
   - continue abx tx with vancomycin and meropenem for PNA
   - daily vancomycin level
   - optimize immunosuppression per BMT
   - consider IVIG, was treated with course of Rituxan
   - continue antiviral [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - patient may need tissue biopsy if still unclear etiology and fevers
   recur
   - ID on board, appreciate recs
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance
   - continue hemodialysis with low K, high Ca, high bicarb bath
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1
   - BK viral load is pending, if this comes back elevated likely
   contributing to current state
   - medications may be contributing to worsening renal fxn.
   - confirmed dense ATN based on urine sediment showing muddy brown
   casts, ? hypotensive episodes
   - continue HD, goal I/O today -3L if SBP>110
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose all meds
   . # Liver failure
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if active signs bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor
   - in 110s with deeper sedation
   - small effusion on [**Doctor Last Name **] 3 days ago, normal pulsus
   - if becomes hypotensive or difficult to ventilate will plan on repeat
   [**Name (NI) **]
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - tx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/caspo for presumed pneumonia and empiric
   treatment, given new rash and fever, may be pre-septic.
   - check u/a
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse 2 units pack red cells now
   and then for hct<21 or if he needs any volume
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Myeloma/PTLD
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 20mg IV daily
   - continue valganciclovir 450mg PO twice a week
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Bicytopenia, with possibility of intravascular hemolysis
   - transfuse plt<30, hct<21
   - guaic all stools

","The patient is a 59-year-old male who underwent a cord transplant 2 months ago and is now presenting with signs of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) along with liver failure, renal failure, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia. The patient was dialyzed yesterday and received a dose of Nitrogen Mustard yesterday evening per Oncology recommendations. A rash developed, but it resolved on its own. Labs showed evidence of intravascular hemolysis, and the patient is receiving platelet transfusion. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis, and the respiratory support has been adjusted accordingly. The patient's fever is 103.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Caspofungin on 6/17/2137 at 08:19 AM and Meropenem on 6/17/2137 at 11:59 AM. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 5 mg/hour and fentanyl at a rate of 125 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include metoprolol given at 05:49 PM on 6/17/2137 and midazolam (Versed) given at 08:45 PM on the same day.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - optimize ventilator settings (match pt
s auto PEEP, increase RR to
   the extent that it doesn
t create so much peak insp pressure to avoid
   barotrauma), to increase minute ventilation in order to maintain
   appropriate acid/base balance
   - Diurese via hemodialysis
   - continue abx tx with vancomycin and meropenem for PNA
   - daily vancomycin level, therapeutic today
   - optimize immunosuppression per BMT
   - consider IVIG, was treated with course of Rituxan
   - continue antiviral [**Doctor Last Name **]

   recur
   - ID on board, appreciate recs
   # New rash
 may be drug rash vs viral vs GVHD of skin
   - minimize new meds
   - derm consult requested, await recs.
   # Acidosis
   - Patient has a pure anion gap acidosis with appropriate respiratory
   compensation. His delta gap/delta bicarb is appropriate and does not
   indicate a secondary metabolic alkalosis or NAG metabolic acidosis.
   - this is all attributable to lactic acidosis which is also likely
   multifactorial due to increased metabolic rate, the acidosis itself
   along with respiratory alkalosis
   - liver disease may also contribute to decreased lactate clearance
   - continue hemodialysis
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals

   # Acute renal failure
   - baseline 1.1
   - BK viral load is pending, if this comes back elevated likely
   contributing to current state
   - medications may be contributing to worsening renal fxn.

   casts, ? hypotensive episodes
   - continue HD, goal I/O today -1L
   - renally dose all meds

   - small effusion on TTE 3 days ago, normal pulsus
   - if becomes hypotensive or difficult to ventilate will plan on repeat
   TTE
   - V/Q scan showed low-moderate probability for PE, but given pt
s high
   pre-test probability for PE, will check LENIs for eval for DVTs. Will
   hold off on CTA for now given renal failure/ no anticoagulation for

The patient is a 59-year-old male who underwent a cord transplant two months ago. He is currently presenting with signs of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) along with liver failure, renal failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), and pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's 24-hour events include a lack of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), dialysis yesterday, and administration of Nitrogen Mustard as per oncology recommendations. The patient's labs show evidence of intravascular hemolysis, with low platelet count and the need for platelet transfusion.

The patient's ABG results from yesterday afternoon showed a pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 38 mmHg, and pO2 of 148 mmHg on CPAP with an FiO2 of 50%. The patient was switched to assisted control ventilation (AC) with a respiratory rate of 23, but the repeat ABG at 1 AM showed a pH of 7.28, pCO2 of 35 mmHg, and pO2 of 114 mmHg. The respiratory rate was increased to 25, but the ABG results continued to worsen.

The patient has a fever of 103.4°F and is on multiple infusions, including midazolam and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs indicate"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has been experiencing multiple complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, liver failure, and sinus tachycardia. The patient also has anasarca (generalized swelling), likely due to fluid overload, and is showing signs of intravascular hemolysis. He has been treated with antibiotics for presumed pneumonia and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy for myeloma/PTLD. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing fevers, hypotension, and difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with multifactorial respiratory failure, including pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and possibly GVHD or PTLD affecting the lungs. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and ventilator settings need to be optimized to improve acid-base balance and minute ventilation.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has dense acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a baseline creatinine of 1.1. There is a pending BK viral load test, which may contribute to the current renal dysfunction. Hemodialysis is being continued, and medications are being dosed based on renal function.

3. Liver Failure: The patient has biopsy-confirmed involvement of lymphoma consistent with PTLD. Medications are being hepatically dosed, and"

   moderate pulmonary dead space. Has autoPEEP of 8 on rounds. Cannot go
   up any farther on tidal volume given ventilation guidelines to avoid
   ARDS; now getting 8 ml/kg ideal body weight. CXR looks improved re:
   patchy infiltrate on the right. Continue present vent settings.
   Dialysis continues. Significant metabolic acidosis persists. CVP up to
   [**11-2**] today. Should have fluid removed with dialysis. Hyperkalemia may
   reflect, in part, intracellular/extracellular shifts with acidemia.
   No clear source of fever. Cultures negative from lines.
   Hct in mid-20's. No need for transfusion now. Question as to whether
   hemolysis present.
   Liver failure contributing to patient's inability to clear lactate.
   Platelet count down today. Patient to receive transfusion.

","The patient's condition is critical and requires immediate attention. Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, anemia, fever, lymphoma, thrombocytopenia, and potential liver failure. The patient's oxygenation remains good, but there are concerns about their ability to compensate for metabolic acidosis due to moderate pulmonary dead space. The patient is receiving 14-15L/min of oxygen and has autoPEEP of 8 on rounds. The tidal volume has been adjusted to 8 ml/kg ideal body weight to avoid ARDS. The patient's chest X-ray shows improved lung fields on the right but a small left effusion. The patient is undergoing dialysis, and significant metabolic acidosis persists. Fluid removal may be necessary with dialysis, and hyperkalemia may be present due to intracellular/extracellular shifts with acidemia. The source of fever is unclear, and cultures from lines are negative. The patient's hemoglobin level is in the mid-20's, indicating anemia, and a transfusion may be required. The patient's platelet count is down, and they will receive a transfusion. There are concerns about hemolysis and liver failure contributing to the patient's inability to clear lactate. Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are essential."

   Was dialysed yesterday with 3L of fluid taken off. Near the end of
   dialysis, pt became tachycardic (HR 170s) and hypotensive (SBP 90s).
   Afebrile at 98.7 F. Pt was given back 300 cc of the rinsing, which
   slowing of HR by ~10 beats/min. BP recovered to 110s-120s/60s-70s. EKG
   was done, ? afib. Gave another 250cc of NS, Lopressor 5 mg x 2 with
   minimal effect.
   Hct dropped to 21.7 from 24.6, was transfused 2 units. After 1 unit of
   pRBC, hct only increased by 0.7. However, with transfusion of blood, BP
   slowed to 90s-100s and SBP 150s-160s.
   INR persistently high at 2.1. Given e/o bleeding in pt's gums and
   suctioned secretions, in addition to OB + stool, decision was made to
   give FFP and plts. Pt also to receive 2 more units of pRBC. Pt most
   likely hemolyzing actively.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - optimize ventilator settings (match pt
s auto PEEP, increase RR to

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent cord transplantation two months ago. He is now presenting with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) involving the liver, renal failure, fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, tachycardia, high fever, and altered mental status. He is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 0.4 and PEEP of 7 cmH2O. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate ranging from 93-162 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 90s-110s/60s-70s mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 31,000/mm3, anemia with a Hct of 21.7%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 10,000/mm3, elevated creatinine levels, lactic acidosis, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's medical history includes pneumonia, anasarca, and a diagnosis of PTLD. He has been treated with antibiotics, steroids, IVIG, antivirals, and optimized immunosuppression.

   2) Renal failure
   3) Anemia
   4) Pneumonia
   5) Thrombocytopenia
   6) Metabolic acidosis
   Oxygenation adequate on FIO2=0.4. Respiratory rate reduced to 20 on
   rounds with improved acid-base status. CXR shows increased vascular
   markings. CVP 16-17. Will need additional fluid removed before we can
   consider weaning from the ventilator. Need for blood products has made
   this difficult in the context of renal failure.
   Dialysed yesterday. Pericardial friction rub present today (soft,
   midsternum, heard during expiration). Will continue to require
   dialysis.
   Continues on antibiotics. No new culture data.
   Hct mid-20's. No need for transfusion at this time. Ongoing concerns
   about low grade bleeding and hemolysis.
   Metabolic acidosis improved post-dialysis, but lactic acid persists.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure, renal failure, liver failure, myelomam, anemia, metabolic acidosis.
2. HPI: The patient had a temperature of 101.8 degrees yesterday morning, which improved after dialysis. They also experienced tachycardia and hypotension at the end of dialysis but improved with fluid administration. The patient has atrial fibrillation and received Lopressor with minimal effect. A transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was given, and the patient converted back to normal sinus rhythm.
3. INR was elevated at 2.1, indicating a bleeding tendency. The patient had bleeding gums and a positive guaiac test, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets were administered.
4. Metabolic acidosis improved with dialysis. Serum calcium was low, and calcium gluconate was given.
5. 24-hour events include fever, antibiotics administration, and other ICU medications.
6. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted above.
7. Vital signs include elevated temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
8. Hemodynamic monitoring shows central venous pressure (CVP) within normal range."

   Imaging: TTE [**2137-6-19**]
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
   is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-6-13**], the heart
   rate is slower and biventricular systolic function is less dynamic. The
   very small pericardial effusion is no longer seen.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - Vent rate [**Month (only) **]'d yest to lower minute ventilation; pt tolerated it
   well. Lactate decreasing. [**Month (only) 51**] be able to decrease MV further and
   prepare for possible extubation if continue to do well.
   - Weaned off Versed; on Fentanyl 50mcg/hr
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance
   - Lactate decreasing; pt able to maintain good pH with resp
   compensation
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools).
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - f/u smear
   - Space out DIC labs Q 8hrs to reduce phlebotomy
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts
   - HD was held off yesterday, plan for this AM. Monitor closely for
   sinus tach/ a fib. [**Month (only) 51**] not be able to tolerate abrupt shifts in fluid
   and electrolytes.
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending, if this comes back elevated likely
   contributing to current state
   - Renally dose meds
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes climbing.
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR<2.0 and + active bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor. This is in the
   setting of persistent fever.
   - may be related to intravascular volume.
   - unknown source of infection.
   - TTE repeated yesterday due to new pericardial rub: no pericardial
   effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Myeloma/PTLD

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
   is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-6-13**], the heart
   rate is slower and biventricular systolic function is less dynamic. The
   very small pericardial effusion is no longer seen.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - Vent rate [**Month (only) **]'d yest to lower minute ventilation; pt tolerated it
   well. Lactate decreasing. [**Month (only) 51**] be able to decrease MV further and
   prepare for possible extubation if continue to do well.
   - Switched to pressure support during rounds today.
 check repeat ABGs
   - Weaned off Versed, fentanyl gtt; on fentanyl boluses only for
   position changing manuevers.
 Assess MS, keep pt alert.
   - Repeat CXR this AM as earlier film was technically inadequate.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance
   - Lactate decreasing; pt able to maintain good pH with resp
   compensation
   - with increased volume of diarrhea, pt may also develop non anion gap
   acidosis, which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic, but worsening in the last few days
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be side effect of chemotherapy
 d/w Heme/Onc
   - Send stool studies, C. diff
 last checked [**6-9**], all neg
   - Will talk to Heme/onc regarding ?prophylactic flagyl.
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - f/u smear
   - Space out DIC labs Q 8hrs to reduce phlebotomy (will discuss
   frequency with Heme/Onc)
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - HD was held off yesterday, plan for this AM. Monitor closely for
   sinus tach/ a fib. [**Month (only) 51**] not be able to tolerate abrupt shifts in fluid
   and electrolytes.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] require CVVH
 will d/w renal about timing of initiation
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending, if this comes back elevated likely
   contributing to current state
   - Renally dose meds
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes climbing.
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR<2.0 and + active bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor. This is in the
   setting of persistent fever.
   - CVP=18 this AM
   - unknown source of infection.
   - TTE repeated yesterday due to new pericardial rub: no pericardial
   effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Myeloma/PTLD
   - Received Valcade last night; will get rituxan this AM
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron decreased to 10mg IV daily per Heme/Onc recs
   - continue valganciclovir 450mg PO twice a week

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure, renal failure, acidemia, and lymphoma. They have been intubated and ventilated, with their oxygen saturation levels improving but still below normal. The patient's CVP is elevated at 18, indicating fluid overload. They require dialysis due to renal failure. The patient is also anemic and thrombocytopenic. There is a concern for possible C. Diff colitis given the diarrhea while on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood counts are decreasing with chemotherapy. The patient is receiving nutrition through a Renal (Full) formula and has multiple lines inserted, including a tunneled Hickman line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter. Prophylaxis measures are in place for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but their oxygen saturation levels are still low. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the ventilation is inadequate or if there is an infection such as pneumonia.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). They require dialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as to remove waste products.
3. Acidosis: The patient has acidemia, which could be due to renal failure or"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - Pt had been doing better, tolerating PS 5/5, but became tachycardic
   and hypertensive yesterday during/after HD, with worsening pH. Required
   vent change to AC, which brought the HR and BP down. Also required
   boluses of fentanyl to control tachycardia and inc BP during position
   change.
   - CXR showing worsening right sided opacities; ddx include drug-related
   lung injury, TRALI, ARDS, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Meets criteria
   for acute lung injury (not ARDS yet)
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while
   allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance; With increased volume of diarrhea, pt may also develop non
   anion gap acidosis, which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - Switch to CVVH to minimize large shifts in fluid and electrolytes
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic, but worsening in the last few days
   - Flagyl started prophylactically per Heme/Onc
   - Per Heme/Onc, unlikely to be side effect of chemotherapy
   - f/u stool studies, c diff
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - f/u smear
   - Space out DIC labs Q 8hrs to reduce phlebotomy (will discuss
   frequency with Heme/Onc)
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - HD was held off yesterday, plan for this AM. Monitor closely for
   sinus tach/ a fib. [**Month (only) 51**] not be able to tolerate abrupt shifts in fluid
   and electrolytes.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] require CVVH
 will d/w renal about timing of initiation
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending, if this comes back elevated likely
   contributing to current state
   - Renally dose meds
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes climbing.
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR<2.0 and + active bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor. This is in the
   setting of persistent fever.
   - CVP adequate
   - unknown source of infection. Received Vanco 500 mg after HD yesterday
   - TTE repeated yesterday due to new pericardial rub: no pericardial
   effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Myeloma/PTLD
   - Received rituxan yesterday
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 10mg IV daily
   - continue valganciclovir 450mg PO twice a week
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of steroid administration
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS. Will consider tightening control, however, there
   was an episode of hypoglycemia two days ago.
   # FEN: on tubefeeds with [**Location (un) 981**] Renal
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q4-6.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The note indicates worsening right-sided opacities on the chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia or other lung-related issues such as drug-related lung injury, TRALI, ARDS, or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

2. Metabolic acidosis with high lactate: The patient has a high lactate level and is experiencing metabolic acidosis. This could be due to increased metabolic rate, liver dysfunction leading to decreased lactate clearance, or diarrhea.

3. Pancytopenia with likely intravascular hemolysis: The patient is showing signs of pancytopenia (low blood cell counts) with evidence of intravascular hemolysis (low haptoglobin level). This may be a result of chemotherapy or another underlying condition.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely caused by dense ATN (acute tubular necrosis) and tumor lysis syndrome (increased uric acid, LDH, low Ca++, high K+). The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and has a new pericardial rub, which may be related to uremia.

5. Liver failure: The patient's liver enzymes are climbing, indicating liver dysfunction. A biopsy confirmed involvement with lymph"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - Pt had been doing better, tolerating PS 5/5, but became tachycardic
   and hypertensive yesterday during/after HD, with worsening pH. Required
   vent change to AC, which brought the HR and BP down. Also required
   boluses of fentanyl to control tachycardia and inc BP during position
   change.
   - CXR showing worsening right sided opacities; ddx include drug-related
   lung injury, TRALI, ARDS, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Meets criteria
   for acute lung injury (not ARDS yet)
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while
   allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance; With increased volume of diarrhea, pt may also develop non
   anion gap acidosis, which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - Switch to CVVH to minimize large shifts in fluid and electrolytes
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic, but worsening in the last few days
   - Flagyl started prophylactically per Heme/Onc
   - Per Heme/Onc, unlikely to be side effect of chemotherapy
   - f/u stool studies, c diff
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - f/u smear
   - Space out DIC labs Q 8hrs to reduce phlebotomy (will discuss
   frequency with Heme/Onc)
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - To start CVVH today
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending, if this comes back elevated likely
   contributing to current state
   - Renally dose meds
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes climbing.
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor. Yesterday
   tachycardia was likely due to respiratory distress, abrupt volume shift
   during HD, and fevers.
   - CVP adequate
   - unknown source of infection. Received Vanco 500 mg after HD yesterday
   - TTE repeated yesterday due to new pericardial rub: no pericardial
   effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Myeloma/PTLD
   - Received rituxan yesterday
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 10mg IV daily
   - continue valganciclovir 450mg PO twice a week
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of steroid administration; labile FS.
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS.
   # FEN: on tubefeeds with [**Location (un) 981**] Renal
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q4-6.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, but no organisms have been grown in the BAL. He also has a likely component of PTLD (Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder) and possibly GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease). His condition has been worsening, with increased work of breathing and tachypnea. He is experiencing metabolic acidosis with high lactate levels, likely due to increased metabolic rate and liver dysfunction. He also has pancytopenia with low-grade bleeding and acute renal failure with anuria. The patient's liver enzymes are climbing, and a biopsy has confirmed involvement with lymphoma consistent with PTLD. He is being treated supportively for liver failure, and underlying causes are being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for acute lung injury or ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to worsening right-sided opacities seen on CXR (chest X-ray).

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has high lactate levels indicating poor tissue perfusion and liver dysfunction. This could be exacerbated by increased volume of diarrhea and may lead to further worsening of his acidosis.

3. Pancytopenia: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been on CPAP 40%/5 PS/5 PEEP since noon and is currently not responsive. The patient underwent dialysis yesterday afternoon and has a history of right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. FiO2 was increased to 50% with O2 sats improving to 92-93%. The patient desaturated to 85% after turning and ABGs showed pH 7.25, PaCO2 48, and PaO2 103. Vent settings were adjusted to A/C 600x15, PEEP 10, FiO2 50%. ABG improved to pH 7.32, PaCO2 36, and PaO2 101. The rate was increased to 20. Rituxan was started but temporarily stopped due to desaturation and then restarted at a lower dose.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient had dialysis yesterday and developed tachycardia at end of
   dialysis as he has done in the past.
   Was on PSV, initially with good gas exchange, and then had episodes of
   desaturation in association with his tachycardia. PEEP increased from 7
   to 10. Rituxin had been started earlier in day. Patient was being
   suctioned for bloody secretions. CXR showed increased right lung
   infiltrate. FIO2 increased to 0.5 with improved saturations. PaCO2
   began to rise and ventilator changed to assist control.
   Patient transfused platelets and FFP.
   Continues to have ongong calcium requirement.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure
   2) Renal failure
   3) Liver failure
   4) Acidosis
   5) Pancytopenia
   6) Tachycardia
   Respiratory status had detiorated with increasing oxygen requirement
   and somewhat decreased respiratory system compliance. CXR shows
   progressive alveolar infiltrate and he is now in the acute lung injury
   category by gas exchange criteria. Plateau pressure now at 24 with peak
   pressure 30. Patient receiving a bit more than 8 ml/kg tidal volume.
   Keep close eye on plateau pressures today. If he reaches 26, would
   decrease tidal volume to 8 ml/kg, which would be approximately 575 ml.
   Maintain PEEP at 10 for now.
   Dialysis yesterday with initial improvement in serum bicarbonate, but
   by this AM bicarb down to 19 with persistent large anion gap. Patient
   to be started on CVVH today. Serum calcium remains low and replacement
   therapy continues.
   LFT's remain elevated. Lactic acid still at 3.
   Patient requiring large amounts of blood products. Concern for ongoing
   bleeding with coagulopathy. INR better today.
   Tachycardia persists. CVP at high normal level this AM. Fever and
   anemia continue. Fluid shifts seem to contribute to his tachycardia.
   Switch to CVVH may help minimize fluid shifts. Consider increased
   sedation as trial to see if patient is uncomfortable despite absence of
   physical findings to suggest this in setting of hepatic encephalopathy;
   consider boluses before moving patient.
   Diarrhea persists. Treatment started for CDiff pending toxin results.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure, renal failure, liver failure, lymphoma, and pancytopenia. The patient underwent dialysis yesterday but developed tachycardia and had episodes of desaturation. The patient's respiratory status deteriorated, with increasing oxygen requirements and decreased respiratory system compliance. A chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates with advanced changes compared to the previous X-ray, indicating possible bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's blood work revealed anemia (Hct 25.9%), thrombocytopenia (Plt 23 K/uL), leukopenia (WBC 1.7), elevated liver enzymes (ALT 62, AST 294), abnormal kidney function (Cr 3.3), and coagulopathy (PTT 54.9, INR 1.8). The patient also had elevated lactate levels (Lactic Acid 3.3 mmol/L) and low albumin (Albumin 2.0 g/dL). Imaging studies showed a bilaterally positioned central venous catheter and an endotracheal tube in acceptable position.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, renal failure, liver failure, acidosis, pancytopenia, and tachycardia. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - Pt required more FiO2 overnight (0.4->0.5) but back to 0.4 this AM.
   Tachycardia likely due to accumulation of blood secretion in airways.
   CXR stable.
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while
   allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis. Goal is to
   decrease FiO2 requirement and PEEP.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance; With increased volume of diarrhea, pt may also develop non
   anion gap acidosis, which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - pt on CVVHD.
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD.
   - Continue Flagyl prophylactically.
   - Tube feeds d/c
d yesterday per heme/onc.
   - Per Heme/Onc, unlikely to be side effect of chemotherapy
   - f/u stool studies, c diff
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - f/u smear
   - Check CBC Q 8 hrs, space out DIC labs Q 12 hrs to reduce over
   phlebotomy
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - To start CVVH today
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending from [**6-6**], if this comes back elevated
   likely contributing to current state; Re-send BK level per ID
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid 9.8 today, will keep current allopurinol dosage.
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes climbing.
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor. Yesterday
   tachycardia was likely due to respiratory distress due to alverolar
   hemorrhage.
   - transfuse plts to minimize the low grade hemorrhage
   - pt is likely still volume overloaded- will continue CVVHD at goal 200
   cc out /hr
   - unknown source of infection. Received Vanco 500 mg after HD yesterday
   - TTE repeated yesterday due to new pericardial rub: no pericardial
   effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - Pt to receive Valcade today per Heme/onc
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 10mg IV daily
   - continue valganciclovir 450mg PO twice a week
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of steroid administration; labile FS.
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS.
   # FEN: tube feeds d/c
d yesterday. Will monitor stool output. Will
   consider re-starting tube feeds (possibly a different one) once
   diarrhea improves.
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q4-6.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is intubated and sedated, and has been diagnosed with multifactorial respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by anasarca (generalized edema), worsening renal function likely due to dense acute tubular necrosis (ATN), significant lactic acidosis, pneumonia, possible graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The patient is also experiencing frequent loose stools, pancytopenia with low-grade bleeding, acute renal failure with new pericardial rub, liver failure, sinus tachycardia, and anemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 141/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, lactate levels, liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are labile and require close monitoring. The patient has been placed on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and is receiving various medications, including antivirals, antibiotics, and immunosuppressants.

   24 Hour Events:
   Hypertension/tachycardia:
   Pt became hypertensive to 180s systolic yesterday evening. HR remained
   100-110. Fentanyl boluses given without effect. Fentanyl drip was
   restarted per BMT recs with goal to keep SBP<160 and DBP<95, however,
   even with increment increases to 150mcg/hr but SBP remained 170-180s.
   IV Hydralazine 10 mg x 2 given, but it actually increased SBP to
   180-190s and HR to 120s. Versed drip restarted at 5mg/hr with boluses
   with no effect. SBP occasionally reached 200.
   Nitro gtt was started at 0.5mic/kg/min and increased to 2mic/kg/min
   with no effect on lowering b/p. Labatolol 20mg iv given with good
   results -> Pt settled down at SBP in 140s, HR 90-100. Labatolol 10mg
   repeated this am for turning as pt b/p began to increase to the 170
   Respiratory:
   Pt was satting at 93% on FiO2 of 40% in the setting of high BP. Pt
   noted to be pulling in much larger tidal volumes often. Suctioned thick

   - Pt had been doing better, tolerating PS 5/5, but became tachycardic
   and hypertensive yesterday during/after HD, with worsening pH. Required
   vent change to AC, which brought the HR and BP down. Also required
   boluses of fentanyl to control tachycardia and inc BP during position
   change.
   - CXR showing worsening right sided opacities; ddx include drug-related
   lung injury, TRALI, ARDS, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Meets criteria
   for acute lung injury (not ARDS yet)
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while

   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic, but worsening in the last few days

    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - f/u smear
   - Space out DIC labs Q 8hrs to reduce phlebotomy (will discuss
   frequency with Heme/Onc)
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - To start CVVH today
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending, if this comes back elevated likely
   contributing to current state
   - Renally dose meds
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes climbing.
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor. Yesterday
   tachycardia was likely due to respiratory distress, abrupt volume shift
   during HD, and fevers.
   - CVP adequate
   - unknown source of infection. Received Vanco 500 mg after HD yesterday
   - TTE repeated yesterday due to new pericardial rub: no pericardial
   effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Myeloma/PTLD
   - Received rituxan yesterday
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis with high lactate levels, pancytopenia with likely intravascular hemolysis and low-grade bleeding, acute renal failure with anuria and dense acute tubular necrosis (ATN), liver failure with elevated liver enzymes and involvement of lymphoma consistent with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), sinus tachycardia minimally responsive to Lopressor, and myeloma/PTLD.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes anasarca, worsening renal function, significant lactic acidosis, pneumonia (although no organisms have been grown on BAL), and possibly graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The CXR shows worsening right-sided opacities, which could be due to drug-related lung injury, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The patient meets criteria for acute lung injury but not yet ARDS.

The patient's metabolic acidosis is high in lactate levels, likely due to increased metabolic rate and liver dysfunction leading to decreased lactate clearance. The patient also has frequent, loose stools, which may be related to chemotherapy or a side effect of immunosuppression.

Pancytopenia is present with likely intravascular hemolysis and low-grade bleeding (bleeding"

   24 Hour Events:
   Hypertension/tachycardia:
   Pt became hypertensive to 180s systolic yesterday evening. HR remained
   100-110. Fentanyl boluses given without effect. Fentanyl drip was
   restarted per BMT recs with goal to keep SBP<160 and DBP<95, however,
   even with increment increases to 150mcg/hr but SBP remained 170-180s.
   IV Hydralazine 10 mg x 2 given, but it actually increased SBP to
   180-190s and HR to 120s. Versed drip restarted at 5mg/hr with boluses
   with no effect. SBP occasionally reached 200.
   Nitro gtt was started at 0.5mic/kg/min and increased to 2mic/kg/min
   with no effect on lowering b/p. Labatolol 20mg iv given with good
   results -> Pt settled down at SBP in 140s, HR 90-100. Labatolol 10mg
   repeated this am for turning as pt b/p began to increase to the 170
   Respiratory:
   Pt was satting at 93% on FiO2 of 40% in the setting of high BP. Pt
   noted to be pulling in much larger tidal volumes often. Suctioned thick
   brown blood. ABG: 7.41/25/67/16 on FiO2 of 40%. FiO2 increased to 50%.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's hypertension and tachycardia are concerning, as he became hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 180s yesterday evening. Despite multiple interventions, including the administration of fentanyl, hydralazine, versed, labetalol, and nitroprusside, the patient's blood pressure remained elevated. 

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning. He was initially oxygenating well on a FiO2 of 40%, but subsequently required an increase in oxygen supplementation to 50% to maintain adequate oxygenation. The patient is being mechanically ventilated with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set at a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 28 cmH2O. 

The patient's thrombocytopenia is another issue, as his platelet count was noted to be 26 in the evening, despite receiving a transfusion of platelets. 

Other findings include elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and D-dimer, as well as abnormalities in liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances. 

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, with multiple organ dysfunctions requiring close monitoring and aggressive management. Potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock, acute"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a stem cell transplant approximately 60 days ago. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by severe lactic acidosis and fluid overload, as well as persistent fevers that are now resolving.

The patient's medical history includes ptld (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder) in the liver and lungs, pancytopenia, liver failure, and tachycardia. The patient also has a history of diarrhea, which is likely related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) according to the oncologist.

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 141/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 18 K/uL"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a stem cell transplant approximately 60 days ago. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is attributed to severe lactic acidosis and fluid overload. The patient also has persistent fevers that are now resolving.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 141/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient is sedated and unresponsive.

Physical examination findings include scleral edema, endotracheal tube in place, poor dentition, and warm skin. The patient has distal pulses bilaterally, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and 3+ edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination reveals no spontaneous movement, and tone is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 1.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, platelet count of 28 K/uL, creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 29.3%, sodium of 101 mg/dL, potassium of 2.2 mg/dL, chloride of 58 mg"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with respiratory failure, who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and increased work of breathing, including anasarca, worsening renal function likely due to dense acute tubular necrosis (ATN), significant lactic acidosis, pneumonia, possible post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) of the lung, and possibly graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 141/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly, but a posterior exam has been deferred. The patient has 2+ pitting edema and 2+ pedal pulses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 1.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, platelet count of 18 K/uL, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 29.0 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 5.2 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 16 mEq/L, glucose of 101 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 2.8 mmol/L.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely to continue developing worsening renal function due to dense ATN. He has significant lactic acidosis which is driving his respiratory rate in order to compensate for metabolic acidosis. He also has pneumonia and likely component of PTLD of the lung and possibly GVHD. The plan is to optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis. Goal is to attempt CPAP/Pressure Support trial today.

2. Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to increased metabolic rate and liver dysfunction leading to decreased lactate clearance. The patient may also develop non-anion gap acidosis, which may make his overall acidosis worse. CVVH will be continued.

3. Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low-grade bleeding. The patient will be transfused if platelet count <30-40 K/uL, and hemoglobin <21%. Plasmapheresis may be considered.

4. Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine sediment showing muddy brown casts. Also, tumor lysis syndrome (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca"

They have been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as anasarca, worsening renal function likely due to dense acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pneumonia, possible graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) of the lung. The patient is also experiencing metabolic acidosis with high lactate levels, pancytopenia with likely intravascular hemolysis and low-grade bleeding, acute renal failure with new pericardial rub likely due to uremia, liver failure with involvement of lymphoma consistent with PTLD, sinus tachycardia unresponsive to Lopressor, and anemia contributing to the sinus tachycardia. Additionally, the patient has lymphoproliferative dysplasia and requires further evaluation and treatment per Heme/Onc recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has anasarca and is likely to continue developing worsening renal function, which can contribute to respiratory failure. Optimizing ventilator settings is essential to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has high lactate levels, indicating a possible increased metabolic rate and liver dysfunction leading to decreased lactate clearance. This can worsen the patient's overall acidosis"

   Assessment and Plan:
   Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - Pt required more FiO2 overnight (0.4->0.5) but back to 0.4 this AM.
   Tachycardia likely due to accumulation of blood secretion in airways.
   CXR stable.
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while
   allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis. Goal is to
   decrease FiO2 requirement and PEEP.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance; With increased volume of diarrhea, pt may also develop non
   anion gap acidosis, which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - pt on CVVHD.
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD.
   - Continue Flagyl prophylactically.
   - Tube feeds d/c
d yesterday per heme/onc.
   - Per Heme/Onc, unlikely to be side effect of chemotherapy
   - f/u stool studies, c diff
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - f/u smear
   - Check CBC Q 8 hrs, space out DIC labs Q 12 hrs to reduce over
   phlebotomy
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - To start CVVH today
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending from [**6-6**], if this comes back elevated
   likely contributing to current state; Re-send BK level per ID
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid 9.8 today, will keep current allopurinol dosage.
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes climbing.
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor. Yesterday
   tachycardia was likely due to respiratory distress due to alverolar
   hemorrhage.
   - transfuse plts to minimize the low grade hemorrhage
   - pt is likely still volume overloaded- will continue CVVHD at goal 200
   cc out /hr
   - unknown source of infection. Received Vanco 500 mg after HD yesterday
   - TTE repeated yesterday due to new pericardial rub: no pericardial
   effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - Pt to receive Valcade today per Heme/onc
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 10mg IV daily
   - continue valganciclovir 450mg PO twice a week
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of steroid administration; labile FS.
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS.
   # FEN: tube feeds d/c
d yesterday. Will monitor stool output. Will
   consider re-starting tube feeds (possibly a different one) once
   diarrhea improves.
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q4-6.
   # Access:
   - Hickman line placed [**6-6**]
   - arterial line placed [**6-16**]
   - HD line placed [**6-16**]
   # PPx: d/c pneumoboots as it may cause trauma and result in petechiae;
   continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has a history of malignancy and is undergoing chemotherapy. The patient presents with anasarca, likely due to fluid overload, and is expected to develop worsening renal function. He also has lactic acidosis, pneumonia, and possible GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and elevated heart rate. His laboratory results indicate pancytopenia, liver dysfunction, and acute renal failure. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and immunosuppressants. He is on CVVHD for renal support and has a Hickman line for vascular access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and possible GVHD. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Optimizing ventilator settings while minimizing barotrauma and stretch injury is essential.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, with elevated creatinine levels and signs of tumor lysis syndrome. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated, and fluid intake should be minimized. Renal dosing of medications is required.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and"

   Assessment and Plan:
   Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD.
   - Pt required more FiO2 overnight (0.4->0.5) but back to 0.4 this AM.
   Tachycardia likely due to accumulation of blood secretion in airways.
   CXR stable.
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while
   allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis. Goal is to
   decrease FiO2 requirement and PEEP.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance; With increased volume of diarrhea, pt may also develop non
   anion gap acidosis, which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - pt on CVVHD.
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD.
   - Continue Flagyl prophylactically.
   - Tube feeds d/c
d yesterday per heme/onc.
   - Per Heme/Onc, unlikely to be side effect of chemotherapy
   - f/u stool studies, c diff
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - f/u smear
   - Check CBC Q 8 hrs, space out DIC labs Q 12 hrs to reduce over
   phlebotomy
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - To start CVVH today
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending from [**6-6**], if this comes back elevated
   likely contributing to current state; Re-send BK level per ID
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid 9.8 today, will keep current allopurinol dosage.
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes climbing.
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor. Yesterday
   tachycardia was likely due to respiratory distress due to alverolar
   hemorrhage.
   - transfuse plts to minimize the low grade hemorrhage
   - pt is likely still volume overloaded- will continue CVVHD at goal 200
   cc out /hr
   - unknown source of infection. Received Vanco 500 mg after HD yesterday
   - TTE repeated yesterday due to new pericardial rub: no pericardial
   effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - Pt to receive Valcade today per Heme/onc
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 10mg IV daily
   - continue valganciclovir 450mg PO twice a week
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of steroid administration; labile FS.
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS.
   # FEN: tube feeds d/c
d yesterday. Will monitor stool output. Will
   consider re-starting tube feeds (possibly a different one) once
   diarrhea improves.
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q4-6.
   # Access:
   - Hickman line placed [**6-6**]
   - arterial line placed [**6-16**]
   - HD line placed [**6-16**]
   # PPx: d/c pneumoboots as it may cause trauma and result in petechiae;
   continue PPI
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo:  ICU; will discuss with heme/onc regarding goals of therapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with respiratory failure, intubated and sedated. He has a history of malignancy and is undergoing chemotherapy. The patient is experiencing multiple medical complications including metabolic acidosis, pancytopenia, acute renal failure, liver failure, and sinus tachycardia. He also has a high risk for thromboembolic events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a high lactate level indicating lactic acidosis, which could be due to increased metabolic rate and liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can increase the risk of infection, anemia, and bleeding. Transfusion of blood products may be necessary to maintain adequate cell counts.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidney function has deteriorated, leading to anuria (lack of urine production) and the development of pericardial rub. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy will be continued as needed.

4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and a biopsy confirmed involvement with lymphoma consistent with PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Supportive treatment and avoidance"

   59F multiple myeloma s/p stem cell transplant c/b ptld in the lungs and
   the liver, as well as fluid overload. In some ways, many of the
   parameters that brought the patient to the icu have improved. Patient's
   gas exchange has improved; lactate has decreased dramatically. With
   CVVH, significant amount of fluid has been removed. Tachycardia and
   hypertension is well-controlled on current regimen; calcium level is
   better. On the other hand, liver function has not improved, with
   increasing INR and worsening LFTs (picture complicated by possible
   ongoing hemolysis); also pt continues to require significant amount of
   blood products.
   For today, will decrease his PEEP and try pressure support to see
   whether patient can ventilate spontaneously adequately. Mental status
   may soon become the limiting factor to extubation.
   Patient's diarrhea has improved with holding tube feeds and initiation
   of flagyl. Will continue flagyl for now, send additional c.diff toxins,
   and will discuss with heme-onc when feeds should be restarted.
   To continue to assess mental status now that patient off versed for
   several days; will check utox for benzo, although versed does have
   active metabolites that may not be picked up in the urine tox screen.
   Will continue fentanyl gtt for now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with multiple myeloma who underwent stem cell transplantation. He has been diagnosed with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and respiratory failure due to metabolic acidosis and fluid overload. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. PTLD: The patient has PTLD, which can progress and involve other organs. There is a risk of additional complications such as liver failure or renal failure.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications like heart failure or pulmonary edema.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may progress and lead to electrolyte imbalances or dehydration.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible liver failure. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, which can lead to renal failure and the need for dialysis.
7. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to the stem cell transplantation and PTLD, making him more susceptible to infections such as bloodstream infections or pneumonia.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of these potential medical complications."

   4. liver failure
   5. fluid overload - improved
   6. renal failure
   59F multiple myeloma s/p stem cell transplant c/b ptld in the lungs and
   the liver, as well as fluid overload. In some ways, many of the
   parameters that brought the patient to the icu have improved. Patient's
   gas exchange has improved; lactate has decreased dramatically. With
   CVVH, significant amount of fluid has been removed. Tachycardia and
   hypertension is well-controlled on current regimen; calcium level is
   better. Lactate coming down, but patient still has anion gap acidosis,
   presumably due to his renal failure. This is necessitating a minute
   ventilation above 10L/min; if we can get bicarb to 20-22, likely will
   only need PaCO2 of 35 and minute ventilation < 10L/min.
   On the other hand, liver function has not improved, with increasing INR
   and worsening LFTs (picture complicated by possible ongoing hemolysis);
   also pt continues to require significant amount of blood products.
   For today, will decrease his PEEP and try pressure support to see
   whether patient can ventilate spontaneously adequately. Mental status
   may soon become the limiting factor to extubation. Will discuss with
   renal changing the CVVH bath to get serum biarb higher; he is losing
   bicarb in diarrhea.
   Patient's diarrhea has improved with holding tube feeds and initiation
   of flagyl. Will continue flagyl for now, send additional c.diff toxins,
   and will discuss with heme-onc when feeds should be restarted.
   To continue to assess mental status now that patient off versed for
   several days; will check utox for benzo, although versed does have
   active metabolites that may not be picked up in the urine tox screen.
   Will continue fentanyl gtt for now.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a stem cell transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by metabolic acidosis and fluid overload. The patient has several medical complications including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), diarrhea (although improving), liver failure, and renal failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 141/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is sedated and not fully alert, but there are no signs of acute distress.

The flow sheet data indicates that the patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, KCl (CRRT), and others. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -5,086 mL, suggesting that fluids have been removed. The respiratory support indicates that the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and ABG results indicating a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 235.

The laboratory results show abnormalities including low white blood cell count"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD now suspected. Per nurse, bloody secretions decreased
   per nurse.
   - Pt was placed on CPAP 10/5 during morning rounds today. Will monitor
   closely for any signs of distress (tachycardia, HTN, desats). Re-check
   ABG
   - He has been off of Versed now and weaning Fentanyl now with goal of
   d/cing Fentanyl completely. Given h/o tachycardia and HTN with
   agitation, will monitor closely and give Fentanyl boluses PRN.
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while
   allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance; With diarrhea, pt may also develop non anion gap acidosis,
   which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - pt on CVVH.
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD.  Frequency has
   been improving per RNs.
   - C diff neg, ok to stop prophylactic flagyl.
   - Restart Tube feeds today (checked with Heme/onc)
   - Per Heme/Onc, unlikely to be side effect of chemotherapy
   - f/u remaining  stool studies, C-diff negative as noted above
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30, hct<21.
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - Check CBC/Plts/Coags Q 6 hrs with CVVH labs, space out additional DIC
   labs
can check daily now to reduce over phlebotomy and given
   repetitive normal fibrinogen levels
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (high uric acid, high LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - Will con
t  CVVH. Adjust today
s CVVH goal to -100cc/hr to even as
   CVP low-normal now.
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - F/u BK viral load levels pending from [**6-6**] and [**2137-6-22**].
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid much improved, will keep current allopurinol dosage, CVVH
   helping levels to decrease as well .
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes still elevated
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - will continue  transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor.
   - still unknown source of infection ?,  will con
t  Vanco 500 mg daily
   with [**Last Name (un) 1029**] level checks daily
   - TTE repeated for questionable pericardial rub and [**Last Name (un) 1027**] no
   pericardial effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 10mg IV daily
   - continue ganciclovir Rx
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of Dexamethasone administration; labile
   FS.
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS.
   # FEN: Restart tube feeds, monitor for worsening diarrhea.
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q8 hours for
   now .

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with post-transplant lymphoproliferative dysplasia, liver failure, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient remains on ventilatory support with AC 600x20, PEEP 5, FiO2 40. He received 3 units of platelets and fresh frozen plasma over the course of the day yesterday. The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs. He was started on various antibiotics and antiviral medications.

Assessment:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has anasarca and is likely to continue developing worsening renal function due to dense acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He also has significant lactic acidosis driving his increased work of breathing to compensate for metabolic acidosis. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course, although his bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has not grown any organisms. He likely has a component of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) of the lung and possibly graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) now suspected. The patient's bloody secretions decreased per nurse.

Plan:
- Place the patient on CPAP 10/5 during morning rounds today and monitor closely for any signs of distress (tachycardia, HTN, desats). Re-check ABG.
- Wean Fentanyl now with the goal of discontinuing it completely. Given the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD now suspected.
   - Pt at FiO2 0.4 and PEEP 5 on A/C mode.  HR 90-100 range now and
   tachycardia improved. He has been off of Versed now and weaning
   Fentanyl now.  CXR stable .
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while
   allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance; With increased volume of diarrhea, pt may also develop non
   anion gap acidosis, which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - pt on CVVH.
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD.  Frequency has
   been improving per RNs.
   - Continue Flagyl prophylactically.
   - Tube feeds d/c
d 8/1 per heme/onc
will consider restart later today,
   pending Heme/Onc approval .
   - Per Heme/Onc, unlikely to be side effect of chemotherapy
   - f/u remaining  stool studies, C-diff negative as noted above
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30-40, hct<21.   Plts at 20 today so will give 2
   bags Plts this morning
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - Check CBC/Plts/Coags Q 8 hrs, space out additional DIC labs
   check daily now to reduce over phlebotomy and given repetitive normal
   fibrinogen levels
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (increasing uric acid, LDH, low Ca, high K)

and Cr 1.2 on [**6-23**].  Will adjust today
s CVVH
   goal to -100cc/hr to get additional fluid off of patient as we approach
   hopeful PS trial and ultimate extubation goal
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - BK viral load is pending from [**6-6**], if this comes back elevated
   likely contributing to current state; Re-send BK level per ID
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid much improved, will keep current allopurinol dosage, CVVH
   helping levels to decrease as well .
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes still elevated
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   -will con
t  transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor.
   - pt is likely still volume overloaded- will continue CVVHD at goal 100
   cc out /hr today ([**6-23**])
   - still unknown source of infection ?,  will con
t  Vanco 500 mg daily
   - TTE repeated for questionable pericardial rub and [**Last Name (un) 1027**] no
   pericardial effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - Pt to receive Valcade today per Heme/onc
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 10mg IV daily
   - continue ganciclovir Rx
   - appreciate BMT recs

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of post-transplant lymphoproliferative dysplasia, liver failure, renal failure, and respiratory failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation since [**2137-6-22**]. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 141/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has also been diagnosed with pneumonia, although no organisms have grown from the BAL. A biopsy confirmed involvement with lymphoma consistent with PTLD.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and increased work of breathing are likely multifactorial, including anasarca, worsening renal function due to dense ATN, significant lactic acidosis, pneumonia, and possible GVHD or PTLD. The patient is being weaned off of sedatives and fentanyl, and his ventilator settings are being optimized.

   5) liver failure
   6) pancytopenia
   Patient switched to PSV on rounds and has VT 700-800 with adequate
   minute ventilation of approximately 9 L/min. Based on last ABG, this is
   a more appropriate minute ventilation for him, and may allow him to be
   extubated in next few days if mental status improves. Oxygenation good
   on FIO2=0.4.  Being suctioned for some bloody secretions. Infiltrate on
   CXR may represent blood or infection. Continues on antibiotics.
   Anion gap acidosis has largely resolved. Now has a non-gap acidosis,
   probably from diarrhea. Patient getting more bicarb in CVVH.
   Improvement in diarrhea with cessation of feeding consistent with
   malabsorption, possibly from GVH disease. C Diff testing is negative.
   Will try to restart tube feeds today. If diarrhea worsens, switch to
   TPN.
   Hct stable. No need for transfusion now.
   LFT's remain elevated. INR at 2.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include lymphoma, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, and acidosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with various medical conditions.

The patient attempted noninvasive ventilation (PSV) yesterday but was still too sedated to support breathing. Diarrhea improved with holding of tube feedings. The sedation level remains high despite the removal of versed, and the patient still requires fentanyl periodically.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 100 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 141/53 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,469 mL and output of 3,796 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 327 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 194, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, and plateau pressure (Pplat) of 16 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia (WBC: 1.1 K/uL), thrombocytopenia (Plt: 20 K/uL), anemia (Hct: 29.0%), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 120/544). The patient also has metabolic acidosis (TCO2: 16 mEq/L) and a positive D-dimer level (5007 ng/mL).

The patient's imaging shows a slight increase in infiltrate at the right base on chest X-ray (CXR), indicating possible infection or blood in the lungs.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, diarrhea, liver failure, and pancytopenia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being suctioned for bloody secretions. The infiltrate on CXR may represent blood or infection, so antibiotics have been continued.

The patient's diarrhea has improved with the cessation of tube feedings, which is consistent with malabsorption possibly from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). C diff testing is negative. The plan is to restart tube feeds today and switch to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if diarrhea worsens.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable, so no transfusion is needed now. The liver function tests (LFTs) remain elevated, with an INR of 2.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be restarted with tube feeds. Glycemic control will be maintained, and lines such as a tunneled (Hickman) line, arterial line, and dial"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD now suspected. Per nurse, bloody secretions decreased
   per nurse.
   - CPAP/PS settings changed to 0/0 during rounds this AM. Pt tolerating
   it well for now. Will monitor closely for any signs of distress
   (tachycardia, HTN, desats). Re-check ABG
   - Pt has been off of versed and fentanyl drips (was given one bolus of
   fentanyl last night). Pt still not waking up- will check U tox and CT
   of head.
   - Plan for extubation soon.
   # Metabolic acidosis, likely multifactorial due to increased metabolic
   rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate clearance; With
   diarrhea, pt may also develop non anion gap acidosis, which may make
   his overall acidosis worse.  Pt now also has resp alkalosis due to high
   Vt that pt draws; uncertain whether this is due to anxiety or
   stimulation of receptors in lungs or vasculature
   - Met acidosis much improved with CVVH
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction (PTLD)
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD. Now with melena
   since re-starting tube feeds yesterday.
   - Will d/w Heme/onc whether to try another bland of TF vs TPN. TPN may
   be more practical if pt is extubated.
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools, melena).
   Also probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30, hct<21.
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - Check CBC/Plts/Coags Q 6 hrs with CVVH labs, space out additional DIC
   labs
can check daily now to reduce over phlebotomy and given
   repetitive normal fibrinogen levels
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, Cr=1 today, much improved with
   CVVH. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine sediment showing muddy
   brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is tumor lysis (high uric
   acid, high LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - D/C CVVH and switch over to intermittent HD starting tomorrow per
   renal; Ins/Outs goal = even as pt
s CVP is low-nl and pt appears
   euvolemic on clinical exam.
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - F/u BK viral load levels pending from [**6-6**] and [**2137-6-22**].
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid much improved, will keep current allopurinol dosage
   - Will need to carefully monitor fluid status given the number of
   antibiotics being given to patient with IVF. Will d/w Heme/Onc
   # Liver failure likely due to PTLD (biospy confirms involvement with
   lymphoma c/w PTLD)
   - Liver enzymes continue to increase, with signs that chemotherapy is
   not improving liver function; treat supportively, treat underlying
   cause
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - will continue  transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   - f/u CT abdomen, pelvis once done
   # Sinus tachycardia, with intermittent episodes of hypertension.
   - still unknown source of infection ?,  will con
t  Vanco 500 mg daily
   with vanco level checks daily; Also continue Micafungin, Flagyl, and
   Aztreonam.
   - TTE show no pericardial effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 2mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of Dexamethasone administration; labile
   FS.
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS.
   # FEN: will d/w Heme/onc regarding re-start of tube feeds vs TPN
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q8 hours for
   now .
   # Access:
   - Hickman line placed [**6-6**]
   - arterial line placed [**6-16**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, pancytopenia, acute renal failure, liver failure, sinus tachycardia, and lymphoproliferative dysplasia. 

Respiratory failure is indicated by the need for CPAP/PS support and the patient's increased work of breathing. The multifactorial etiology includes pneumonia, PTLD, and possibly GVHD. The ABG results show a respiratory alkalosis due to high tidal volume ventilation, and the RSBI value of 88 indicates a risk for extubation failure.

Metabolic acidosis is likely multifactorial, caused by increased metabolic rate, liver dysfunction leading to decreased lactate clearance, and diarrhea. The CVVH has improved the patient's metabolic acidosis.

Pancytopenia is characterized by low WBC count, Hct, and platelets. This may be due to chemotherapy side effects and intravascular hemolysis. Transfusion of blood products is recommended if platelet count is below 30,000 and Hct is below 21%.

Acute renal failure is indicated by a rise in creatinine from 1.1 to 1 today, confirmed dense ATN with muddy brown casts, and tumor lysis syndrome with high uric acid, low calcium, and high potassium levels. CVVH has improved renal function, and the plan is to switch to intermittent HD starting tomorrow"

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt was placed on CPAP/PS during AM rounds, [**8-25**] with FiO2 of 0.4.
   Minute ventilation was ~9 L most of the time however just after pt was
   cleaned and turned, pt became hypertensive to systolic 190s and was
   pulling in a lot of tidal volume. Pt was bolused with Fentanyl, with
   minimal effect. Pt was persistently hypertensive, but BP went down to
   130-140s with Labetalol IV. Last ABG: 7.43/33/114/23 at 5:20 AM.
   Tube feeds were re-started yesterday
   Pt had melena x 2, one last night, another this AM.
   Pt having hiccup-like abdominal contractions, and was given Zofran to
   good effect.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD now suspected. Per nurse, bloody secretions decreased
   per nurse.
   - Pt was placed on CPAP 10/5 during morning rounds today. Will monitor
   closely for any signs of distress (tachycardia, HTN, desats). Re-check
   ABG
   - He has been off of Versed now and weaning Fentanyl now with goal of
   d/cing Fentanyl completely. Given h/o tachycardia and HTN with
   agitation, will monitor closely and give Fentanyl boluses PRN.
   - Optimize vent settings to minimize barotrauma/stretch injury while
   allowing for respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis.
   # Metabolic acidosis with high lactate, likely multifactorial due to
   increased metabolic rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate
   clearance; With diarrhea, pt may also develop non anion gap acidosis,
   which may make his overall acidosis worse.
   - pt on CVVH.
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction which is PTLD, this is
   being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG,
   antivirals
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD.  Frequency has
   been improving per RNs.
   - C diff neg, ok to stop prophylactic flagyl.
   - Restart Tube feeds today (checked with Heme/onc)
   - Per Heme/Onc, unlikely to be side effect of chemotherapy
   - f/u remaining  stool studies, C-diff negative as noted above
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools). Also
   probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30, hct<21.
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - Check CBC/Plts/Coags Q 6 hrs with CVVH labs, space out additional DIC
   labs
can check daily now to reduce over phlebotomy and given
   repetitive normal fibrinogen levels
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, now with new pericardial rub
   likely due to uremia. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine
   sediment showing muddy brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is
   tumor lysis (high uric acid, high LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - Will con
t  CVVH. Adjust today
s CVVH goal to -100cc/hr to even as
   CVP low-normal now.
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - F/u BK viral load levels pending from [**6-6**] and [**2137-6-22**].
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid much improved, will keep current allopurinol dosage, CVVH
   helping levels to decrease as well .
   # Liver failure- treat supportively, treat underlying cause
   - Liver enzymes still elevated
   - biospy confirms involvement with lymphoma c/w PTLD
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - will continue  transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   # Sinus tachycardia, minimally responsive to Lopressor.
   - still unknown source of infection ?,  will con
t  Vanco 500 mg daily
   with [**Last Name (un) 1029**] level checks daily
   - TTE repeated for questionable pericardial rub and [**Last Name (un) 1027**] no
   pericardial effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 10mg IV daily
   - continue ganciclovir Rx
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of Dexamethasone administration; labile
   FS.
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS.
   # FEN: Restart tube feeds, monitor for worsening diarrhea.
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q8 hours for
   now .
   # Access:
   - Hickman line placed [**6-6**]
   - arterial line placed [**6-16**]
   - HD line placed [**6-16**]
   # PPx: d/c pneumoboots given low plt (per heme/onc) ; continue PPI

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 0.4. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.43/31/87. The patient also has pneumonia and suspected PTLD/GVHD involvement in the lungs.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a high lactic acid level of 2.0 mmol/L, which could be due to increased metabolic rate, liver dysfunction, and diarrhea.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is anuric with new-onset pericardial rub likely due to uremia. Dense ATN is confirmed with muddy brown casts. Tumor lysis syndrome is also contributing to renal failure, as indicated by high uric acid, high LDH, low Ca++, and high K+ levels.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. This may be due to chemotherapy side effects or intravascular hemolysis.

5. Liver Failure: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and involvement with lymphoma consistent with PTLD. The underlying cause, PTLD, is being treated with decreased immunosuppression, steroids, IVIG, and antivirals.

   Patient placed on SBT during rounds; after 5 mins on PSV 0/0, patient
   remained comfortable with RSBI approximately 30. Will continue on these
   settings for next hour. Patient has minimal cough with suctioning. He
   remains unresponsive. There are concerns about his ability to ""protect
   his airway,"" although I would not consider that an absoulute
   contraindication to extubation in this setting.
   Patient has done well on CVVH. Electrolytes and metabolic acid
   improved.
   Afebrile in past 24 hours. Antibiotics adjusted as above.
   LFT's remain elevated.
   Patient remains unresponsive off sedation. Will check head CT given his
   low platelet count.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, lymphoma, acute renal failure, and pancytopenia. The patient has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) throughout the day, but became hypertensive yesterday evening with a ventilation exchange (VE) of 12 L/min. The patient was given fentanyl for pain relief and suctioned for bloody secretions. Labetalol was administered intravenously for hypertension, with an improved blood pressure. The patient is currently on PSV 5/5. Tube feeds were restarted yesterday but had two episodes of melena. Hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. Adjustments have been made in antibiotics due to concerns of drug-induced liver problems and marrow suppression. New antibiotics include Vancomycin, Mycofungin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl. Fluid balance is negative with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). 

The patient's 24-hour events include history obtained from medical records, allergies to no known drugs, and previous doses of antibiotics. The patient is currently receiving potassium chloride (KCl) at a rate of 2 mEq./hour as part of CRRT. Other ICU medications include folic acid, protonix, allopurinol, insulin, vancomycin, mycofungin, decadron, aztreonam, and flagyl.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 96 bpm (83-111 bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 141/53 mmHg (72 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute (8-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR), and the central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg (4-14 mmHg). Fluid intake and output are within normal limits.

Respiratory support includes ventilator mode CPAP/PSV, tidal volume (Vt) of 772 mL (596-885 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 88, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results of pH 7.43, PaCO2 33 mmHg, PaO2 285 mmHg, and HCO3- 20 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, overweight, no pupils dilated, sclera not icteric, normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, no nasogastric tube or orogastric tube, cardiovascular examination normal"

   Spleen U/S [**2137-6-25**]
   FINDINGS: The spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm compared to prior
   measurement of 12.7 cm (by CT abdomen on [**2137-6-10**]). There is an
   ill-defined focal hypoechoic lesion in
   the spleen measuring 1.2 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm without vascularity on color
   flow
   images and likely represents a benign entity. Small amount of free
   fluid is
   noted in the left and right lower quadrants.
   IMPRESSION: Interval increase in the size of the spleen now measuring
   15 cm compared to prior 12.7 cm. Free fluid noted in bilateral lower
   quadrants.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial etiology for tachypnea and
   increased work of breathing. Patient has anasarca and will likely
   continue to develop worsening renal function likely due to dense ATN.
   He has a significant lactic acidosis which is also driving his RR in
   order to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He also was diagnosed
   with pneumonia earlier in his hospital course although his BAL has not
   grown any organisms. He also has likely component of PTLD of the lung
   and possibly GVHD now suspected. Per nurse, bloody secretions decreased
   per nurse.
   - CPAP/PS settings changed to 0/0 during rounds this AM. Pt tolerating
   it well for now. Will monitor closely for any signs of distress
   (tachycardia, HTN, desats). Re-check ABG
   - Pt has been off of versed and fentanyl drips (was given one bolus of
   fentanyl last night). Pt still not waking up- will check U tox and CT
   of head.
   - Plan for extubation soon.
   # Metabolic acidosis, likely multifactorial due to increased metabolic
   rate and liver dysfxn leading to decreased lactate clearance; With
   diarrhea, pt may also develop non anion gap acidosis, which may make
   his overall acidosis worse.  Pt now also has resp alkalosis due to high
   Vt that pt draws; uncertain whether this is due to anxiety or
   stimulation of receptors in lungs or vasculature
   - Met acidosis much improved with CVVH
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction (PTLD)
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD. Now with melena
   since re-starting tube feeds yesterday.
   - Will d/w Heme/onc whether to try another bland of TF vs TPN. TPN may
   be more practical if pt is extubated.
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools, melena).
   Also probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30, hct<21.
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - Check CBC/Plts/Coags Q 6 hrs with CVVH labs, space out additional DIC
   labs
can check daily now to reduce over phlebotomy and given
   repetitive normal fibrinogen levels
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, Cr=1 today, much improved with
   CVVH. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine sediment showing muddy
   brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is tumor lysis (high uric
   acid, high LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - D/C CVVH and switch over to intermittent HD starting tomorrow per
   renal; Ins/Outs goal = even as pt
s CVP is low-nl and pt appears
   euvolemic on clinical exam.
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - F/u BK viral load levels pending from [**6-6**] and [**2137-6-22**].
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid much improved, will keep current allopurinol dosage
   - Will need to carefully monitor fluid status given the number of
   antibiotics being given to patient with IVF. Will d/w Heme/Onc
   # Liver failure likely due to PTLD (biospy confirms involvement with
   lymphoma c/w PTLD)
   - Liver enzymes continue to increase, with signs that chemotherapy is
   not improving liver function; treat supportively, treat underlying
   cause
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - will continue  transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   - f/u CT abdomen, pelvis once done
   # Sinus tachycardia, with intermittent episodes of hypertension.
   - still unknown source of infection ?,  will con
t  Vanco 500 mg daily
   with vanco level checks daily; Also continue Micafungin, Flagyl, and
   Aztreonam.
   - TTE show no pericardial effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of PTLD (Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder). The patient is currently experiencing liver, kidney, and respiratory failure. He is intubated and on CPAP/PSV support. His blood pressure is stable, but there have been some increases with movement. The patient remains unresponsive with minimal gag and cough reflexes. 

The patient has a history of sinus tachycardia and intermittent hypertension, with unknown sources of infection. He is being treated with multiple antibiotics and antifungals. His renal function is anuric with acute renal failure, and he has been diagnosed with ATN (Acute Tubular Necrosis) and tumor lysis syndrome. 

His liver function is failing, likely due to PTLD, with elevated liver enzymes. He has pancytopenia with low platelet count, hemolysis, and bleeding. He is receiving blood product transfusions as needed. 

The patient's blood sugar is being monitored closely due to Dexamethasone administration. He is scheduled for CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration) and HD (Hemodialysis) sessions. 

The patient has a Hickman line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place. He is also receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP (Ventilator-Associated P"

   Renal U/S [**2137-6-25**]
   Final: FINDINGS: Both kidneys are normal without hydronephrosis,
   lesions, or masses.
   There are no obstructive renal calculi. The corticomedullary
   differentiation is well preserved. The right kidney measures 11.1 cm.
   The left kidney measures 10.9 cm. The urinary bladder is partially
   distended with the catheter.
   IMPRESSION: Normal renal son[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of hydronephrosis.
   .
   Spleen U/S [**2137-6-25**]
   FINDINGS: The spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm compared to prior
   measurement of 12.7 cm (by CT abdomen on [**2137-6-10**]). There is an
   ill-defined focal hypoechoic lesion in the spleen measuring 1.2 x 1.4 x
   1.7 cm without vascularity on color flow
   images and likely represents a benign entity. Small amount of free
   fluid is noted in the left and right lower quadrants.
   IMPRESSION: Interval increase in the size of the spleen now measuring
   15 cm compared to prior 12.7 cm. Free fluid noted in bilateral lower
   quadrants.
   .
   CXR [**2137-6-25**]
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-24**], there is still some
   8ncreased opacification at the right base medially as well as in the
   retrocardiac area.  Again, these areas could reflect consolidation,
   especially aspiration. Tubes remain in place.
   Microbiology:
   HCV, HBV, CMV viral load pending
   [**2137-6-24**] Stool- no virus isolated so far
   EBV, Herpes 6, BK viral load pending
   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: From purely respiratory standpoint pt is ready
   for extubation. Pt tolerated PS 0/0 for most of the day yesterday with
   adequate RSBI scores. Pt is still quite unresponsive (barely opens eyes
   to noxious stimuli) but appears to be waking up slowly. CT head neg for
   acute process. Must weigh the risk and benefit of ventilation- pt has
   been on vent for 11 days now, and with neutropenia, pt
s risk of VAP is
   quite high.
   - check spontaneous breathing trials
   - Start Scopolamine patch
   - Discussed with Pt
s outpt oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at length. Pt still
   in tenous state with dynamic fluid balance with falling hematocrit.
   Will hold off on extubation for now.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis, much improved.
   - CVVH d/c
d yesterday, next HD tomorrow
   - treat underlying cause of liver dysfunction (PTLD)
   # Frequent, loose stools; chronic. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to GVHD. Now with melena
   since re-starting tube feeds yesterday.
   - Will d/w Heme/onc whether to try another bland of TF vs TPN. TPN may
   be more practical if pt is extubated.
    # Pancytopenia, with likely intravascular hemolysis and low grade
   bleeding (bleeding gums, pink residuals, guaiac pos stools, melena).
   Also probably side effect of chemotherapy.
   - transfuse if plt<30, hct<21.
   - haptoglobin level is low yield given liver failure
   - Check CBC/Plts/Coags Q 6 hrs with CVVH labs, space out additional DIC
   labs
can check daily now to reduce over phlebotomy and given
   repetitive normal fibrinogen levels
   # Acute renal failure, baseline 1.1, Cr=1 today, much improved with
   CVVH. Anuric. Confirmed dense ATN based on urine sediment showing muddy
   brown casts; also adding to the renal failure is tumor lysis (high uric
   acid, high LDH, low Ca, high K)
   - D/C CVVH and switch over to intermittent HD starting tomorrow per
   renal; Ins/Outs goal = even as pt
s CVP is low-nl and pt appears
   euvolemic on clinical exam.
   - Appreciate Renal recs.
   - F/u BK viral load levels pending from [**6-6**] and [**2137-6-22**].
   - Renally dose meds
   - Uric acid much improved, will keep current allopurinol dosage
   - Will need to carefully monitor fluid status given the number of
   antibiotics being given to patient with IVF. Will d/w Heme/Onc
   # Liver failure likely due to PTLD (biospy confirms involvement with
   lymphoma c/w PTLD)
   - Liver enzymes continue to increase, with signs that chemotherapy is
   not improving liver function; treat supportively, treat underlying
   cause
   - hepatically dose meds and avoid toxins
   - transfuse FFP if INR>1.3-1.6 and + active bleeding
   - will continue  transfuse Plts if plt<30-40
   - treat underlying PTLD
   - f/u CT abdomen, pelvis once done
   # Sinus tachycardia, with intermittent episodes of hypertension.
   - still unknown source of infection ?,  will con
t  Vanco 500 mg daily
   with vanco level checks daily; Also continue Micafungin, Flagyl, and
   Aztreonam.
   - TTE show no pericardial effusion
   - pt has high coagulability due to presence of malignancy- DVTs ruled
   out by LENI, VQ scan [**Location (un) 988**]-mod probability. Will hold off on CTA
   given renal failure
   - anemia likely contributing, will transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
   - no signs of ischemia on ECG, no chest pain prior to intubation
   # Lymphoproliferative dysplasia
   - continue sirolimus 2mg PO daily
   - Decadron 2mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - appreciate BMT recs
   # Blood sugar in the setting of Dexamethasone administration; labile
   FS.
   - Q6 hr FS, on ISS.
   # FEN: will d/w Heme/onc regarding re-start of tube feeds vs TPN
   - electrolytes: Ca persistantly low. Likely citrate in blood products
   is binding Ca. Pt on Ca repletion sliding scale. Monitor Q8 hours for
   now .
   # Access:
   - Hickman line placed [**6-6**]
   - arterial line placed [**6-16**]
   - HD line placed [**6-16**]
   # PPx: intermittent pneumoboots given low plt (per heme/onc) ; continue
   PPI
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo:  ICU; will discuss with heme/onc regarding goals of therapy.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of PTLD (Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder) leading to liver, kidney, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- The patient tolerated CPAP/PS 0/0 for most of the day but was placed on BiPAP overnight for rest.
- Blood pressure was stable in the 140s systolic but increased to 160s systolic with turning, returning to baseline soon without intervention.
- The patient remains unresponsive, with minimal gag and cough reflexes, although the gag reflex appears to be returning.
- The patient had received 1 bag of platelets yesterday, but the platelet count this morning is still low at 18.
- The patient continues to produce small amounts of melena.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Last dose of antibiotics:
   - Caspofungin: [**2137-6-24**] 08:05 AM

   Patient did well throughout the day yesterday with no ventilatory
   support. Will recheck SBT briefly this AM and then extubate if he is
   doing well. CXR suggest layering of pleural effusions. With CVVH off,
   will try to minimize fluids given today. Patient still without strong
   gap. Will apply scopolamine patch to reduce upper airway secretions.
   Mild metabolic acidosis persists, with small anion gap likely due to
   renal failure; lactate down to 2. Electrolytes acceptable.
   Intermittent melena. Hct down slightly. Monitor Hct more closely today
   to assess need for transfusion. Renal to be alerted re: possible need
   for dialysis if he is extubated and has problems with the transfusion.
   Severe neutropenia persists. Receiving platelets per protocol.
   Enlargement of spleen concerning re: response (or lack thereof) to
   therapy for lyphoma.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, liver failure, lymphoma, and pancytopenia. The patient remains somnolent but shows improvement in the gag reflex. Head CT is negative for an acute intracranial process. The patient has an enlarged spleen and continues to experience melena, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV mode, Vt of 587 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 11, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 47. The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a reading of 141/53 mmHg. The heart rate is within normal limits, at 92 bpm. Oxygen saturation remains at 97%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, and lactate, indicating renal dysfunction and possible tissue hypoperfusion. The WBC count is low, suggesting leukopenia. Hemoglobin levels are also decreased, indicating anemia. Platelet count is significantly reduced, leading to thrombocytopenia. Liver enzymes AST and ALT are elevated, indicating hepatic injury. 

The patient's electrolyte levels are within acceptable ranges, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab values such as albumin,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male who underwent a stem cell transplant and was complicated by post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and respiratory failure due to metabolic acidosis and fluid overload. The patient received experimental doses of bortezomib and rituximab earlier in the week.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells and one bag of platelets. Despite discontinuation of fentanyl and versed, the patient remains very sedated with minimal response. The patient continues to have frequent melena, with very low platelet counts. A discussion took place between the patient's oncologist, critical care team, and healthcare proxy regarding the patient's aggressive lymphoma and little likelihood of meaningful recovery, as well as multi-organ system failure. It was decided to extubate the patient in the morning and make him comfortable. The family and healthcare proxy are to assemble at the bedside at 11 AM. The patient remains on a pain scale of 5/5 and no more lab tests are needed, canceling the scheduled hemodialysis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of spinal cord injury and bone marrow transplant, presenting with PTLD (liver, lungs) and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the ICU for management. The patient's current condition includes profuse melena, ongoing respiratory support, and pancytopenia. His vital signs are stable, but he is unresponsive and has dilated pupils that react sluggishly to light. Laboratory results show acute renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal blood counts. The patient's prognosis is poor, and there is consensus between the patient's oncologist, health care proxy, and ICU team to transition goals of care to comfort measures only. All medications will be discontinued, and morphine will be titrated as needed for comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and he is dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to underlying lung involvement from PTLD.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. This can lead to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's blood counts are significantly decreased, resulting in compromised immune function and increased susceptibility to infections.
4. GI bleed: The presence of profuse melena suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and"
