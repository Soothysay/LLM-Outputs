","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic ovarian cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for cholecystitis and ERCP. She underwent sphincterotomy and stent placement but remains intubated due to concerns of small bowel obstruction (SBO) and aspiration risk. She was extubated overnight but experienced episodes of biliary emesis and diarrhea. Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 122/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F). She is receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholecystitis: The patient's initial admission was for cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. This condition can lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture, sepsis, and shock if not managed appropriately.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's symptoms of emesis, diarrhea, and known peritoneal metastases suggest the possibility of SBO. If left untreated, this condition can lead to bowel ischem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis, acalculous, who was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation. The patient was extubated overnight and experienced an episode of non-biliary emesis and diarrhea. The patient has allergies to sulfa antibiotics and had a last dose of Linezolid on 1/29/2018 at 8:03 AM. The patient is receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a slight elevation in heart rate. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 415 mL in and 340 mL out over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 35%. The patient's blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while other lab results are within normal range. The patient's assessment remains the same as admission, with ongoing care in the ICU focusing on nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Potential complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and potential hepatic dysfunction due to elevated liver enzymes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented initially with malaise and was transferred for an ERCP procedure. Post-procedure, she experienced vomiting and concern for aspiration, leading to intubation. She is being treated for an enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) with Linezolid. The patient was extubated overnight and is currently on 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC) oxygen.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent intubation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and assessment of respiratory function are necessary.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting, which may have led to inflammation or infection of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). Close observation of liver function tests (LFTs) and white blood cell count (WBC) is important.
3. Suspected small bowel obstruction (SBO): There is a mention of suspected SBO based on the transfer summary. Further evaluation and management are required to confirm and address this condition.
4. UTI: The patient is currently being treated for an enterococcus UTI with Linezolid. Regular monitoring of infection parameters and adherence to the antibiotic regimen are crucial.
5. Hypertension: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented initially with malaise and was transferred for an ERCP procedure. Post-ERCP, she experienced vomiting and was intubated due to concern for aspiration. She is being treated for an enterococcus UTI with Linezolid. The patient was extubated overnight and is currently on 2L NC. Her vital signs are stable, but she has episodes of bilious emesis and diarrhea. Her urine output has decreased this morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure - The patient's initial intubation was due to vomiting post ERCP, which could indicate aspiration. Although she has been extubated and is currently stable on 2L NC, monitoring oxygenation and sending sputum culture if she produces a sample are recommended. A low threshold to expand coverage to include GNs for HAP should also be considered.
2. Cholecystitis - The patient underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting, and her bilious output is slowly improving. There is a possibility of transient bacteremia or aspiration, as indicated by the increased WBC count this morning. Continuing IVF (bolus now for UOP then maintenance), and keeping the patient NPO are advised.
3. Suspected SBO - Based on the OSH transfer summary, the patient may"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic ovarian cancer, treated with TAH and BSO, adjuvant chemotherapy, peritoneal stripping, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented initially with malaise and was transferred for an ERCP procedure. Post-ERCP, she developed vomiting and concern for aspiration, leading to intubation. She is being treated for an enterococcus UTI with Linezolid. 

Upon admission to the ICU, she was extubated overnight and is now on 2L NC. She has had several episodes of bilious emesis and diarrhea. Her UOP has decreased this morning. She has a sulfa allergy and her last dose of antibiotics was Linezolid on [**2118-1-29**] 08:03 AM. She is currently receiving morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium infusions.

Her vital signs show a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 122/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her temperature is normal. 

Her physical examination reveals that she is awake and alert, with a few rales at the bases of her lungs. She has a regular rhythm without murmurs, soft abdomen with tenderness in the right upper quadrant and lower mid-abdomen, and no edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous surgeries including total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She presented initially with malaise and was transferred to another hospital for ERCP. After the procedure, she experienced vomiting and was intubated due to concern for aspiration. She is being treated for an enterococcus UTI with Linezolid and was extubated overnight.

24-hour events include several episodes of bilious emesis and diarrhea, with a decreased urine output this morning. She is currently on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen, CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending.

She has a history of allergies to sulfa antibiotics and anaphylaxis from a previous antibiotic dose. Her current medications include morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and Linezolid.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 122/49 to 159/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted to the ICU and required invasive ventilation from 06:48 PM on 01/28/2118 to 10:28 PM on the same day. The patient was successfully extubated overnight. However, the patient experienced episodes of bile-stained non-bloody emesis, diarrhea, and inability to pass flatus in the morning.

The patient has a history of allergy to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and experienced anaphylaxis after receiving antibiotics. The last dose of antibiotics, Linezolid, was administered on 01/29/2118 at 08:03 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications including Pantoprazole (Protonix), Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), and Morphine Sulfate. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms. The flow sheet data shows vital signs with a maximum temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 86/65 mmHg to 159/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with total intake of 415 mL and total output of 340 mL. Blood products were given totaling 500 mL"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history significant for metastatic ovarian cancer diagnosed 10 years ago, surgery (TAH and BSO), adjuvant chemotherapy, peritoneal stripping in 2010, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was transferred from another hospital for cholecystitis and underwent an ERCP procedure, including sphincterotomy and stenting. The patient was intubated for concern of aspiration post-ERCP and is now experiencing episodes of non-bloody bilious vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to pass flatus.

The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), with a history of anaphylaxis. She received Linezolid for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is currently on multiple medications including Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and Morphine Sulfate.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms mentioned above. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 105 bpm (with a normal range of 81-109 bpm), blood pressure of 86/65 mmHg (with a normal range of 70-159/84 mmHg), respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 12-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula with CPAP/"

   Imaging: CT Torso [**2118-1-29**]:
   1. Dilated proximal small bowel loops with adjacent fluid. More distal
   loops
   of small bowel are decompressed. Air is seen within the colon although
   the
   left colon is decompressed. Findings are suggestive of an incomplete
   small-bowel obstruction.
   2. Transverse colon, and pelvic small bowel loops appear adherent to
   the
   anterior abdominal wall and may reflect the site of incomplete
   small-bowel
   obstruction although no transition point is identified.
   3. Necrotic masses in the left anterior abdominal wall, and along the
   left
   external iliac artery and vein suggestive of necrotic masses which may
   be
   necrotic nodes in the setting of patient's known ovarian cancer.
   4. Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules suggestive of metastatic
   disease.
   5. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent
   compressive atelectasis on the left side. No findings in the lung
   suggestive
   of infection.
   6. Dilated contrast-filled esophagus may predispose the patient to
   aspiration.
   7. Stent within the CBD. There is periportal edema but no significant
   biliary ductal dilation.

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history significant for metastatic ovarian cancer diagnosed 10 years ago, status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy (last treated on 9/24), and peritoneal stripping in 2010, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was transferred from Hospital6 for cholecystitis and ERCP, where she underwent sphincterotomy and stent placement. The patient is currently extubated but had an episode of aspiration and is now experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

24-hour events include copious vomiting with temporary improvement after NG tube placement, uncontrolled vomiting after bearcat barium contrast prior to CT torso, negative CT torso for acute abdominal pathology but showing extensive lung metastases, pain control improved with Dilaudid, onset of diarrhea, negative C. diff test, increase in Dilaudid dose from 0.25mg IV Q3H PRN to 0.5mg, brief run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and initiation of flagyl and cefepime to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and had anaphylaxis to the last dose of antibiotics, Linezolid, Metronidazole, and Cefepime.

Infusions include Morphine sulfate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history significant for metastatic ovarian cancer diagnosed 10 years ago. She has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), adjuvant chemotherapy, and peritoneal stripping in the past. She also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

The patient was transferred from another hospital for cholecystitis and ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). After the ERCP procedure, she successfully underwent sphincterotomy and stenting. However, she developed nausea/vomiting and diarrhea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Pain control: The patient requires acute and chronic pain management.
2. Nausea/vomiting: She is experiencing copious vomiting, which has temporarily improved with the placement of an NG (nasogastric) tube. However, vomiting returned after bearcat barium contrast prior to a CT torso scan.
3. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): Imaging studies show dilated proximal small bowel loops with adjacent fluid, suggesting an incomplete small-bowel obstruction. Distal loops of the small bowel are decompressed, and air is seen within the colon, although the left colon is decompressed. The findings are suggestive of an incomplete small-bowel obstruction without a clear transition point.

","The patient is a female with a history of ovarian cancer, presenting with chief complaints of nausea and vomiting. She underwent an ERCP procedure and was initially improved with an NG tube placement, but her vomiting returned after receiving bearcat barium contrast prior to a CT torso. The CT torso showed extensive lung metastases, but no acute abdominal pathology. The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which is negative for C. diff. Her pain control has been improved with increased doses of Dilaudid. She also had a brief run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), but her electrolytes were within normal limits.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and experienced anaphylaxis after receiving antibiotics.

   1. Dilated proximal small bowel loops with adjacent fluid. More distal
   loops of small bowel are decompressed. Air is seen within the colon
   although the left colon is decompressed. Findings are suggestive of an
   incomplete small-bowel obstruction.
   2. Transverse colon, and pelvic small bowel loops appear adherent to
   the anterior abdominal wall and may reflect the site of incomplete
   small-bowel obstruction although no transition point is identified.
   3. Necrotic masses in the left anterior abdominal wall, and along the
   left external iliac artery and vein suggestive of necrotic masses which
   may be necrotic nodes in the setting of patient's known ovarian cancer.
   4. Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules suggestive of metastatic
   disease.
   5. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent
   compressive atelectasis on the left side. No findings in the lung
   suggestive of infection.
   6. Dilated contrast-filled esophagus may predispose the patient to
   aspiration.
   7. Stent within the CBD. There is periportal edema but no significant
   biliary ductal dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yr old lady with a PMH significant for metastatic ovarian cancer
   diagnosed 10 years ago, s/p TAH and BSO, adjuvant chemo (last treated
   [**9-24**]), and peritoneal stripping in [**2110**], HTN, hyperlipidemia, who
   presented initially to [**Hospital6 **] with malasie and
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for ERCP, now extubated and with likely aspiration
   PNA.
   1. Respiratory failure
 intubated due to vomiting post ERCP, extubated
   upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] but then with persistent vomiting, and likely
   aspiration yesterday. CXR and CT with B effusions and consolidation vs.
   PNA at L base.  Now with low-grade temps; leukocytosis yesterday, and
   now leukopenia.
   - Continue cefepime, flagyl, linezolid
   - f/up blood cultures
   2. Tachycardia: HRs in the 80s on admission, now with a lot of stool
   output that is unmeasured.  First c. diff neg, has an enterococcus UTI
   (at OSH), treated with linezolid, and is currently in pain.  Lower
   suspicion for PE given alternative explanations, but high risk given
   underlying malignancy.
   - check ECG
   - NS bolus
   - f/up cultures
   - continue abx as above
   - monitor UOP
   3. Cholecystitis: s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting. Bilis
   trending down.
   - Conitnue IVF (bolus now for UOP then maintenance), NPO
   - continue to trend LFTs
   4. SBO: confirmed by CT here, [**1-18**] intraabdominal mets, still no flatus
   today and no BS on exam.
   - Continue NGT, IVF, NPO
   5. UTI: c/w linezolid, f/up urine Cx here
   6. HTN: hold antihypertensives given low-grade temps and tachycardia,
   concern for impending septic shock

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old lady with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer. She presented with malaise and was initially treated at Hospital6 before being transferred to Hospital1 for ERCP. The patient has been extubated but experienced persistent vomiting and likely aspiration, leading to respiratory failure. She also has tachycardia, cholecystitis, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory support.
2. Tachycardia may be caused by infection, sepsis, or pain.
3. Cholecystitis may lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture or abscess formation.
4. Small bowel obstruction can progress to bowel ischemia or necrosis if not relieved.
5. Urinary tract infection may progress to pyelonephritis or sepsis if not appropriately managed.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, administer appropriate antibiotics, manage pain, and provide supportive care."

   loops of small bowel are decompressed. Air is seen within the colon
   although the left colon is decompressed. Findings are suggestive of an
   incomplete small-bowel obstruction.
   2. Transverse colon, and pelvic small bowel loops appear adherent to
   the anterior abdominal wall and may reflect the site of incomplete
   small-bowel obstruction although no transition point is identified.
   3. Necrotic masses in the left anterior abdominal wall, and along the
   left external iliac artery and vein suggestive of necrotic masses which
   may be necrotic nodes in the setting of patient's known ovarian cancer.
   4. Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules suggestive of metastatic
   disease.
   5. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent
   compressive atelectasis on the left side. No findings in the lung
   suggestive of infection.
   6. Dilated contrast-filled esophagus may predispose the patient to
   aspiration.
   7. Stent within the CBD. There is periportal edema but no significant
   biliary ductal dilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of biliary obstruction. She has a history of known ovarian cancer and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient likely experienced an aspiration event and has been started on cefepime and flagyl for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) coverage. An NG tube has been placed for ongoing emesis. Imaging shows partial small bowel obstruction, multiple lung and intraabdominal metastases, bilateral pleural effusions, and dilated esophagus. The patient's vital signs are stable with a sinus tachycardia. She is receiving IV fluids and has been started on various medications, including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal necrotic masses, metastatic disease, and a stent in the common bile duct.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's dilated esophagus and the presence of emesis, there is a risk of aspiration leading to pneumonia.
2. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest an incomplete small bowel obstruction. If left untreated, it can lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
3. Metastatic disease progression: The presence of multiple lung and intraabdominal metastases indicates advanced cancer. Disease progression can lead"

   Imaging:
   Chest/Abdomen
    CT:
   1. Dilated proximal small bowel loops with adjacent fluid. More distal
   loops of small bowel are decompressed. Air is seen within the colon
   although the left colon is decompressed. Findings are suggestive of an
   incomplete small-bowel obstruction.
   2. Transverse colon, and pelvic small bowel loops appear adherent to
   the anterior abdominal wall and may reflect the site of incomplete
   small-bowel obstruction although no transition point is identified.
   3. Necrotic masses in the left anterior abdominal wall, and along the
   left external iliac artery and vein suggestive of necrotic masses which
   may be necrotic nodes in the setting of patient's known ovarian cancer.
   4. Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules suggestive of metastatic
   disease.
   5. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent
   compressive atelectasis on the left side. No findings in the lung
   suggestive of infection.
   6. Dilated contrast-filled esophagus may predispose the patient to
   aspiration.
   7. Stent within the CBD. There is periportal edema but no significant
   biliary ductal dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yr old lady with a PMH significant for metastatic ovarian cancer
   diagnosed 10 years ago, s/p TAH and BSO, adjuvant chemo (last treated
   [**9-24**]), and peritoneal stripping in [**2110**], HTN, hyperlipidemia, who
   presented initially to [**Hospital6 **] with malasie and
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for ERCP, now extubated and with likely aspiration
   PNA.
   1. Respiratory failure
 intubated due to vomiting post ERCP, extubated
   upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] but then with persistent vomiting, and likely
   aspiration yesterday. CXR and CT with B effusions and consolidation vs.
   PNA at L base.  Now with low-grade temps; leukocytosis yesterday, and
   now leukopenia.
   - Continue cefepime, flagyl, linezolid
   - f/up blood cultures
   2. Tachycardia: HRs in the 80s on admission, now with a lot of stool
   output that is unmeasured.  First c. diff neg, has an enterococcus UTI
   (at OSH), treated with linezolid, and is currently in pain.  Lower
   suspicion for PE given alternative explanations, but high risk given
   underlying malignancy.
   - check ECG
   - NS bolus
   - f/up cultures
   - continue abx as above
   - monitor UOP
   3. Cholecystitis: s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting. Bilis
   trending down.
   - Conitnue IVF (bolus now for UOP then maintenance), NPO
   - continue to trend LFTs
   4. SBO: confirmed by CT here, [**1-18**] intraabdominal mets, still no flatus
   today and no BS on exam.
   - Continue NGT, IVF, NPO
   5. UTI: c/w linezolid, f/up urine Cx here
   6. HTN: hold antihypertensives given low-grade temps and tachycardia,
   concern for impending septic shock

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with malaise and was initially treated at Hospital6 before being transferred to Hospital1 for an ERCP procedure. Upon arrival at the ICU, she was extubated but then developed persistent vomiting and likely aspiration. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, tachycardia, cholecystitis, small bowel obstruction, and a urinary tract infection. The patient's current medications include cefepime, flagyl, linezolid, IV fluids, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 143/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. Imaging studies reveal an incomplete small bowel obstruction, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules suggestive of metastatic disease, and necrotic masses in the left anterior abdominal wall. The patient's condition is complicated by potential medical complications such as respiratory failure, tachycardia, cholecystitis, small bowel obstruction, and a urinary tract infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of ERCP. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications including metoprolol for recurrent bouts of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), heparin sodium for prophylaxis, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), pantoprazole (Protonix), and linezolid. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and has experienced anaphylaxis in the past.

24-hour events include an EKG, PICC line placement, stool culture, and administration of several medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the addition of small bowel obstruction and acute pain. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.9 C (100.3 F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 174/85 mmHg to 129/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 9.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.5 g/dL, low platelet count (Plt) at 31 K/uL, normal creatinine (Cr"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history significant for metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was transferred from another hospital for cholecystitis and underwent an ERCP procedure, which involved sphincterotomy and stent placement. The patient remains afebrile and hemodynamically stable but is experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 2.2 mmol/L, and an elevated lactic acid level of 28.9. Her renal function is normal, with a serum creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT and PTT, but an INR within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal a partially obstructed small bowel and a PICC line tip that is slightly obscured, likely over the proximal/mid superior vena cava. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

The patient has multiple potential complications, including tachycardia, pain control, nausea/vomiting, small bowel obstruction, leukocytosis, pneumonia, and cholecystitis. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Tachycardia: Monitor heart rate.
2. Pain control: Administer analgesics as needed.
3. Nausea/vomiting: Continue anti"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history significant for metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous surgeries. She was transferred from another hospital for cholecystitis and ERCP. The patient underwent sphincterotomy and stent placement during the ERCP procedure. 

The patient's current condition includes acute pain, nausea/vomiting, small bowel obstruction (SBO), leukocytosis, pneumonia due to aspiration, and acute cholecystitis. Her previous issues of respiratory failure and anemia are improving. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be due to hypokalemia and diarrhea. 
2. Pain control: Aggressive pain management is required due to acute and chronic pain.
3. Nausea/vomiting: Antiemetics should be continued, and aspiration precautions should remain in place.
4. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a partial SBO, likely related to her ovarian cancer. NG tube placement, NPO status, IV fluids, and antiemetics should be continued. Further evaluation and management are needed.
5. Leukocytosis: This could be secondary to infection or sepsis. Blood cultures, sputum culture, and stool cultures should be repeated, and antibiotics should be continued.
6. Pneumonia: Aspiration pneumonia is a concern. Sputum culture"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous abdominal surgeries (total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). She presented to the hospital for cholecystitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which included sphincterotomy and stenting.

Since admission, the patient has had several complications. She experienced an episode of respiratory failure but has since resolved. However, there is concern for aspiration pneumonia. The patient also developed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which was likely related to persistent hypokalemia caused by emesis and diarrhea. She was started on metoprolol for this condition and her potassium levels have been repleted.

The patient is also suffering from small bowel obstruction (SBO), as indicated by a CT abdomen showing partial SBO. She is experiencing emesis, diarrhea, and peritoneal involvement of ovarian cancer. She has been placed on nasogastric tube to low intermittent suction, is nil per os (NPO), and is receiving maintenance intravenous fluids. Antiemetic medications such as ondansetron and compazine have been initiated.

Leukocytosis has been noted, raising concerns for sepsis, possibly secondary to aspiration and/or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Blood cultures have been drawn, and antibiotics have been started empirically"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with a chief complaint of ERCP. The patient has a history of recurrent bouts of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) for which metoprolol was started. The patient also has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and experienced anaphylaxis after taking antibiotics. 

In the ICU, the patient was given various medications including Linezolid, Metronidazole, Cefepime, Pantoprazole (Protonix), Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), Hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and Metoprolol. 

The patient's vital signs were monitored, showing a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 174/85 to 129/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's heart rhythm was normal sinus rhythm.

The patient underwent several tests, including EKG, stool culture, and PICC line placement. The abdominal X-ray showed a slightly obscured PICC line tip, likely over the proximal/mid superior vena cava (SVC), without pneumothorax. The blood cultures were pending, and tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and sputum were negative.

The patient's lab results showed elevated white blood"

The patient's current medications include hydromorphone, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggest possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension could indicate a potential pulmonary embolism, especially considering the prolonged immobility in the ICU.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate may suggest pneumonia, particularly given the risk factors such as intubation and prolonged bed rest.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobilization and the presence of risk factors like cancer increase the risk of developing deep vein"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented initially with malaise and was transferred to another hospital for ERCP. She was intubated due to vomiting post ERCP and later extubated upon arrival to the ICU. However, she experienced persistent vomiting and likely aspiration yesterday. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/41 mmHg to 183/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm. The patient has been receiving various medications including cefepime, flagyl, linezolid, metoprolol, heparin, pantoprazole, and fentanyl patch.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown signs of respiratory failure, including likely aspiration, bilateral effusions, and consolidation on imaging, suggesting pneumonia. She is being treated with antibiotics (cefepime, flagyl, linezolid) and follow-up blood cultures.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient experienced NSVT and tachycardia, which could be due to sepsis, pain, BBL withdrawal, or hypoK. Her electrolytes have been repleted, and beta-blocker (metoprolol) has been restarted with improvement in ectopy. Further attempts will be made to perform a permanent pacemaker insertion (PNGT) today.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting. Her bilirubin levels have normalized, indicating improvement in cholecystitis.
4. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has confirmed SBO, likely secondary to intraabdominal metastases. She has had flatus yesterday, and her bowel sounds are hypoactive today. She is receiving IV fluids, NPO (nothing by mouth), and a nasogastric tube.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a urine culture at the outpatient setting, which is pending here with the nasogastric tube.
6. Anemia: The patient may be hemoconcentrated on admission. Stool guaiac is negative, but nasogastric tube output guaiac is positive. Further investigation is needed, including checking the pre-admission hemoglobin concentration and continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
7. Metastatic ovarian cancer: The patient has intraabdominal and pulmonary metastases, as revealed by recent CT scans. Pain control is well managed with a fentanyl patch and dilaudid as needed. Further oncology care will be coordinated with the oncology team at another hospital.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old lady with a medical history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, who presented initially with malaise and transferred to the hospital for ERCP. She was intubated due to vomiting post ERCP but was extubated upon arrival to the ICU. However, she developed persistent vomiting and likely aspiration yesterday.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to vomiting post ERCP. She was extubated upon arrival to the ICU but then developed persistent vomiting and likely aspiration yesterday. There are bilateral effusions and consolidation on chest X-ray and CT, suggesting pneumonia.

2. Cardiovascular (CV) issues: The patient was increasingly tachycardic yesterday and had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). This could be due to sepsis, pain, beta-blocker withdrawal, or hypokalemia. Her electrolytes have been repleted, and metoprolol has been restarted with improvement in ectopy.

3. Cholecystitis: The patient underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting. Her bilirubin levels have trended down and are now normal.

4. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has confirmed SBO on CT scan. She had flatus yesterday, and her bowel sounds are hypoactive today. Her nasogastric"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old lady with a medical history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented initially with malaise and was transferred to the hospital for ERCP. She has been diagnosed with likely aspiration pneumonia, cholecystitis, small bowel obstruction, urinary tract infection, anemia, and metastatic ovarian cancer. The patient has been extubated but experienced persistent vomiting and likely aspiration yesterday. She has been started on cefepime, flagyl, and linezolid for respiratory failure, and her beta-blocker was restarted with improvement in ectopy. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, further complications from cholecystitis, potential bowel ischemia or perforation from small bowel obstruction, worsening urinary tract infection, progression of anemia, and complications related to metastatic ovarian cancer such as pain management and further metastasis. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, bowel movements, urine output, and laboratory values to promptly identify any deterioration or complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history significant for metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous surgeries including total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She presented initially with malaise and was transferred to the hospital for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She became intubated due to vomiting post-ERCP but was later extubated upon arrival at the ICU. However, she then developed persistent vomiting and likely aspiration. The note mentions that she has likely developed pneumonia (PNA) based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings showing bilateral effusions and consolidation at the left base.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also a concern. She experienced an increase in heart rate (tachycardia) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which improved with the restart of a beta-blocker. There is a question regarding whether this was due to sepsis, pain, or bile juice aspiration.

Additionally, the patient had cholecystitis after the ERCP, with improving bilirubin levels. She also has a small bowel obstruction (SBO) confirmed by CT, with no flatus today and no bowel sounds on examination. She remains on nothing by mouth (NPO) and is being managed conservatively.

Furthermore, the patient is being treated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history significant for metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for cholecystitis and ERCP, and subsequently underwent sphincterotomy and stenting. The patient has experienced several complications since admission, including respiratory failure with concern for aspiration pneumonia, anemia with positive guaiac positive green emesis, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) likely related to hypokalemia and bowel obstruction syndrome (SBO). She also has an ongoing urinary tract infection (UTI) with VRE colonization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biliary obstruction: The patient had biliary obstruction which was managed with ERCP and stenting. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but she remains on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI).
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, but it has since resolved. However, there is concern for aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the contaminated sputum culture.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, as evidenced by the positive guaiac positive green emesis. The hematocrit (HCT) drop may be dilutional due to intravenous fluids (IVFs).
4. Non-sustained Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT): The patient had NSVT, which is likely related to hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous surgeries including total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for cholecystitis and ERCP, which she underwent successfully. The patient was extubated but experienced an episode of aspiration and is now presenting with diarrhea and probable partial small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has stable vital signs but shows signs of anemia, leukocytosis, and hypokalemia. The patient's current medications include linezolid, metronidazole, cefepime, pantoprazole, sucralfate, heparin, hydromorphone, and metoprolol. She is NPO, on IV fluids, and receiving aspiration precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biliary obstruction: The patient's biliary obstruction has been resolved with ERCP, sphincterotomy, and stenting. Her liver function tests are improving.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient had resolved respiratory failure but now has a concern for aspiration pneumonia (PNA). She is on antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI).

   years ago, s/p TAH and BSO, adjuvant chemo (last treated [**9-24**]), and
   peritoneal stripping in [**2110**], HTN, hyperlipidemia transferred from
   [**Hospital6 **] for cholecystitis and ERCP, now s/p sphincterotomy
   and stent, extubated successfully, but after episode of aspiration and
   now w/ diarrhea and probable partial SBO.
   1. Biliary obstruction: No active issues.
   s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting. LFTs improving. She remains
   afebrile and hemodynamically stable, but is on abx for UTI (see below).
   With new leukocytosis, though lfts stable.
   -- Trend LFTs
   -- Continue to monitor hemodynamics, cis
   2. Respiratory Failure: Resolved, however concern for aspiration PNA.
   Sputum culture contaminated.
   -- NPO, aspiration precautions
   -- continue flagyl and cefepime to cover HAP (and Linezolid for both
   HAP and UTI)
   3. Anemia: Stable but trending down. Guiac positive green emesis,
   however guiac negative green stool. HCT drop may be dilutional given
   IVFs.
   -- continue check for FOB
   -- Continue PPI , sucralfate
   -- Active type and screen
   -- Transfuse for HCT <21
   -- Large bore IVs x 2
   4. NSVT: High activity in setting of persistent hypokalemia with emesis
   and diarrhea. Likely component of BB withdrawl. PO metoprolol failed.
   -- Aggressive monitoring of lytes with [**Hospital1 7**] K/Mg
   -- replete lytes for K<4, Mg<2
   -- Change to metoprolol 10mg IV Q4H,
   5. SBO: [**1-18**] cancer and adhesions from prior TAH/BSO. NGT output minimal
   over the past 24 hours, however with quiet BS.
   -- Clamp NG tube for transfer given no output
   -- NPO, aspiration precautions, IVFs

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for cholecystitis and ERCP, and now presents with diarrhea, probable partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and other medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biliary obstruction: The patient underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting, which resolved the biliary obstruction. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient successfully extubated but had an episode of aspiration and is at risk for pneumonia. She is being kept NPO and on aspiration precautions.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, possibly due to dilutional effects from IV fluids. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed.
4. Non-ST-segment elevation ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): The patient has been experiencing NSVT, likely related to hypokalemia and electrolyte imbalances. Correcting these imbalances is important.
5. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of cancer and adhesions, which could contribute to SBO. She is currently on NPO status, with minimal NG tube output. Further evaluation and management are required.
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, including a significant colonization of Vancomycin-resistant"

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, based on the 24-hour events, it appears that the patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Allergies:
The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and has experienced anaphylaxis in response to these medications.

Medications:
The patient has received several medications, including Linezolid, Metronidazole, Cefepime, Pantoprazole, Carafate, Heparin Sodium, Hydromorphone, and Metoprolol.

Review of systems:
The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data:
The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/67 mmHg to 161/125 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance:
The patient has received a total of 4,136 mL of fluids since 19:00 AM, including 339 mL through the PO route, 4,061 mL through IV fluids, and 2,860 mL of blood products. The total output includes 2,510 mL of urine, 300 mL of NG drainage, and 790 mL of stool drainage. The fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,276 mL.

Respiratory support:
The patient is not receiving any respiratory support, and their oxygen saturation is maintained at 94%.

Physical examination:
The patient's peripheral vascular examination, skin assessment, and neurologic examination were not performed.

Lab results:
The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 21,100 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, normal glucose level of 165 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, elevated potassium level of 5.0 mEq/L, and decreased sodium level of 112 mEq/L. Other lab values, including WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, TropT, and various electrolytes, are provided in the report.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's assessment includes tachycardia, pain control, nausea/vomiting, small bowel obstruction, leukocytosis, pneumonia, cholecystitis, and ICU care. The plan includes continued monitoring and management of these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. The presence of pneumonia should be closely monitored.
2. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance indicates the possibility of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and cardiovascular complications.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's small bowel obstruction and previous history of chronic pain suggest potential gastrointestinal complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
4. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests renal dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated potassium level and decreased sodium level indicate electrolyte imbalances that need to be corrected to avoid cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical condition to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history significant for metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cholecystitis, and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, anemia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), small bowel obstruction (SBO), urinary tract infection (UTI), and ovarian cancer. The patient underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting, extubation, aspiration precautions, and is currently on antibiotics for UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biliary obstruction: No active issues. The patient had previous biliary obstruction treated with ERCP, sphincterotomy, and stent placement. LFTs are improving, indicating resolution of the biliary obstruction.
2. Respiratory Failure: Resolved. The patient had respiratory failure but has been successfully extubated. However, there is concern for aspiration pneumonia.
3. Anemia: Stable but trending down. The patient has anemia that is being monitored closely. Hematocrit (HCT) drop may be dilutional due to IV fluids.
4. NSVT: The patient has nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which may be related to persistent hypokalemia with emesis and diarrhea. This could be a component of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
5. SBO: The patient has a history of cancer and ad"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous surgeries. She was transferred to the ICU for cholecystitis and ERCP, and underwent sphincterotomy and stenting. The patient is currently extubated but had an episode of aspiration and is now experiencing diarrhea and probable partial small bowel obstruction (SBO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biliary obstruction: The patient had a biliary obstruction that was treated with ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but she remains at risk for complications related to the biliary system.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure but has since resolved. However, there is concern for aspiration pneumonia (PNA). She should continue to be on aspiration precautions and receive appropriate antibiotic coverage.

3. Anemia: The patient has guaiac-positive green emesis but guaiac-negative green stool. Her hematocrit (HCT) drop may be dilutional due to intravenous fluids. She should continue to be monitored for fresh blood in the stool, and measures should be taken to address the anemia if it becomes significant.

4. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): The patient has been active with episodes of NSVT, which may be related to persistent hypokalemia caused"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, who presented to the hospital with respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. She has a history of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and peritoneal stripping 10 years ago. She also has hypertension.

The patient's course in the ICU has been complicated by several issues. She initially experienced small bowel obstruction (SBO) and was transferred from another hospital for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to external compression from a tumor. She is now extubated.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. She has a sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19700 cells/mm³, elevated lactate levels at 2.2 mmol/L, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135 mEq/L.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 29-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and lab values. The patient's allergies include sulfonamide antibiotics, and he has experienced anaphylaxis in response to antibiotics.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), metoprolol, and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission.

Vital signs show a heart rate of 91 bpm within normal range (88-104 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 140/71 mmHg to 120/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute within normal range (9-21 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is slightly below normal at 36.2°C (97.1°F).

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1950 mL and output of 2450 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 500 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, and there is no mention of chest tube drainage or other drainage.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.30, which is below normal. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and other assessments.

Laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count of 210 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, slightly elevated potassium level of 5.0 mg/dL, and slightly decreased magnesium level of 1.3 mg/dL. The creatinine level is within normal range at 0.6 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are below normal, indicating no cardiac damage. Glucose levels are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include tachycardia, pain control, nausea/vomiting, small bowel obstruction, leukocytosis, pneumonia, cholecystitis, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Small bowel obstruction: This condition can lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, and infection if not managed appropriately.

2. Pneumonia: Aspiration pneumonia can progress to severe respiratory distress and sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.

3. Cholecystitis: Acute inflammation of the gallbladder can lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture, infection, and bile duct obstruction.

4. Leukocytosis: Elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is crucial.

5. Negative fluid balance: The negative fluid balance indicates a significant loss of fluids, which may result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid replacement are essential.
