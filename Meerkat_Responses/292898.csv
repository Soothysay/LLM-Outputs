   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications given
   history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA.  Of note, she
   did not develop fevers until transfer to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was most likely a
   secondary event such as an aspiration in the setting of intubation.
   Also considered other sources of infection (blood, urine),
   pancreatitis, pregnancy, or cardiac ischemia as possible triggers. CEx1
   negative. [**Doctor First Name 293**]/lipase moderate elevated, but not likely indicative of
   pancreatitis. UCG negative and blood and urine cx are pending.
   - continue insulin gtt until gap has closed and patient is able to
   tolerate PO
   - continue D5 at 75ml/hr, consider switching to D51/2NS and free water
   per OG tube. Use boluses of LR for volume repletion if necessary.
   - monitor Q4H chemistries for hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia
   - A-line placed, will monitor frequent ABGs
   - check EKG, Posm, and urine for ketones
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   - check triglycerides
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation.  Patient received
   vanc, flagyl, and levo at OSH prior to transfer.
   - f/u culture data from [**Hospital 1215**] (if drawn)
   - UA, UCx, BCx, sputum Cx and urinary legionella were resent
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue vanc/levo for likely aspiration pneumonia (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for
   2-3 days until Cx data is back and continue to follow w/ CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of
   free water.
   - continue IV fluids (D51/2NS) with LR as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   - continue free water flushes via OG (150ml Q4H), transition to PO
   water when able and hydrate to thirst.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status.
   - repeat CXR to assess ET tube position
   - consider bronchoscopy given thick secretions
   - would also consider that she may have been taking narcotics at home;
   of note, she is not as well compensated as one would expect for someone
   her age (CO2 in 30s)
   - will wean down narcotics today, and if doing well will extubate
   today.
   # Altered mental status:
   Most likely toxic-metabolic in setting of DKA, dehydration.  CT head
   negative for acute process.  Although she has facial edema, no blood
   was found behind TMs, so this is most likely from IV fluids
   - f/u final CT read
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr unknown, Cr on presentation 2.1
   Cr has improved to 1.3 then 1.0 with IV fluids.  Would not be surprised
   if she had some ATN from hypotension, but seems to be doing well.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Anemia:  Current Hct 28.1 down slightly from 31, baseline not known.
   Unclear if acute or chronic.  Likely still somewhat hemoconcentrated.
   - send type and screen
   - follow HCTs
   # FEN: IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as detailed above
   # Access:  has left IJ from OSH, will need to remove in < 24 hours; PIV
   x 1, will obtain more PIV access
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) admitted to the MICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has a history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA. The precipitating cause of this episode is likely poor compliance with medications. The patient developed fevers after being transferred to a different hospital, suggesting a secondary event such as aspiration during intubation. Other potential triggers for DKA include infection, pancreatitis, pregnancy, or cardiac ischemia, but these are less likely based on the information provided.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm and a blood pressure of 138/65 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient is intubated for airway protection due to poor mental status. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 7,372 mL and output of 2,550 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,822 mL. The patient's urine output is within normal limits at 2,550 mL.

Laboratory results indicate hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 232 mg/dL and acidosis with a pH of 7.23. The patient also has mild hypernatremia with a sodium level of 152 mEq/L and mild"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has a history of diabetes, allergies to penicillins, codeine, Vicodin, morphine, and hypernatremia (high sodium levels). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 157/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals warm skin and scattered rhonchi in the chest. Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels at 232 mg/dL, low potassium levels at 3.5 mEq/L, high bicarbonate levels at 28.1 mmol/L, and an elevated white blood cell count of 24.2 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include DKA, fever, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, altered mental status, renal failure, and chronic anemia. The DKA is being treated with aggressive intravenous fluids and insulin. The cause of the DKA is suspected to be a combination of medication noncompliance and possible infectious etiology. The patient is also being given vancomycin and levofloxacin due to fevers"

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications given
   history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA and possible
   infectious source.  Of note, she did not develop fevers until transfer
   to [**Hospital1 **] so this was most likely a secondary event such as an aspiration
   in the setting of intubation; pt has remained afebrile since
   admission.  Also considered other sources of infection (blood, urine),
   pancreatitis ([**Doctor First Name 293**]/lipase moderate elevated, but not likely indicative
   of pancreatitis), pregnancy (UCG negative), or cardiac ischemia (CEx3
   negative) as possible triggers. Blood and urine cx are pending.
   - continue insulin 2unit/hr gtt for 2-3hrs until patient tolerates PO
   and then switch to glargine 24units SC qday
   - continue D5 at 75ml/hr until d/c insulin gtt and then switch to NS at
   75cc/hr.
   - FSBS q2hr
   - monitor Q4H chemistries for hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and will
   replete as needed.
   - A-line placed, will recheck ABG considering elevated lactate and low
   pO2 which is does not match clinical presentation
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   - check triglycerides
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation and possible CAP,
   yet afebrile since admission, c/o
black
 productive cough, CXR shows
   small R infiltrate. Urine Legionella neg, other cultures pending.
   Patient received vanc, flagyl, and levo at OSH prior to transfer.
   - f/u culture data from [**Hospital 1215**] (if drawn)
   - UCx, BCx, sputum Cx were resent, pending results.
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue levo for total of 5days (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for possible asp PNA or
   CAP. Will follow cultures and CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of
   free water, improving Na with free water deficit today at 0.7 L
   - continue IV fluids (D5) with LR boluses as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   - will encourage PO water and hydrate to thirst.
   -continue to monitor electrolytes q4hr
   #Hypokalemia:
   Most likely [**1-25**] to intracellular transfer with correction of DKA and
   insulin.
   -continue to monitor lytes q4hr and replete as needed.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status,
   extubated on [**2172-9-21**] [**1-25**] to improving mental status, patient has been
   saturating well in the high 90
s and has improved clinically despite
   ABG pO2 of 47 which is most likely [**1-25**] to poor ABG draw.
   - will repeat ABG
   - continue to monitor O2 on RA.
   # Altered mental status/Agitation/Psych:
   Altered mental status is improved as pt is alert and oriented; AMS
   likely toxic-metabolic in setting of DKA, dehydration, CT of head
   negative for acute process, Facial edema upon admission most likely
   from IV fluids. Seen by psych for agitation; diff dx includes delirium,
   possible bipolar d/o decompensation, drug induced/withdrawal.
-Per psych, Haldol 5mg IV, Ativan 2mg IV PRN agitation (with Cogentin 1mg PRN).
-Will check TSH, B12, and folate per psych rec.
-Consider addition of home psych meds of Abilify and Celexa per psych rec
#Left Knee Pain:
c/o of left knee pain [**1-25**] to referred pain from IO in the field by EMS, no s/s i
nfection in joint
-Continue Dilaudid PO
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr unknown, Cr on presentation 2.1, Cr improving with
   currently at 0.8 with IV fluids.  ARF most likely [**1-25**] to prerenal
   causes such as hypotension/dehydration, adequate urine output.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down from 28.9
28.1
27.2 most likely [**1-25**] to
   hemodilution with increased IVF.
   - follow HCTs
   #Hypothyroidism:
   -will check TSH
   -Continue levothyroxine
   # FEN: IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as detailed above; will
   begin [**Doctor First Name **] diet PO.
   # Access:  has left IJ from OSH, will need to remove in < 24 hours; PIV
   (20gauge) x 1, d/c A-line in Right Radial

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been treated for DKA and is now stable. The patient's current complaints include stomach pain, left knee pain, and a non-productive cough. She also reports feeling better and is ready to leave. The patient has a history of poor medication compliance and frequent presentations to the hospital with DKA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but has since been extubated and is saturating well on room air. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation is recommended.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to diuresis from partially treated DKA. Free water deficit is being corrected, and the patient should be encouraged to drink fluids to thirst.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient has hypokalemia, possibly due to intracellular potassium shift during DKA treatment. Electrolytes should be monitored regularly and repletion should be done as needed.
4. Altered Mental Status/Agitation: The patient initially had altered mental status but is now alert and oriented. She has been started on Haldol and Ativan for agitation, and her mental status should continue to be monitored.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, possibly due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications given
   history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA.  Of note, she
   did not develop fevers until transfer to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was most likely a
   secondary event such as an aspiration in the setting of intubation.
   Also considered other sources of infection (blood, urine),
   pancreatitis, pregnancy, or cardiac ischemia as possible triggers. CEx1
   negative. [**Doctor First Name 293**]/lipase moderate elevated, but not likely indicative of
   pancreatitis. UCG negative and blood and urine cx are pending.
   - continue insulin gtt until gap has closed and patient is able to
   tolerate PO
   - continue D5 at 75ml/hr, consider switching to D51/2NS and free water
   per OG tube. Use boluses of LR for volume repletion if necessary.
   - monitor Q4H chemistries for hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia
   - A-line placed, will monitor frequent ABGs
   - check EKG, Posm, and urine for ketones
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   - check triglycerides
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation.  Patient received
   vanc, flagyl, and levo at OSH prior to transfer.
   - f/u culture data from [**Hospital 1215**] (if drawn)
   - UA, UCx, BCx, sputum Cx and urinary legionella were resent
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue vanc/levo for likely aspiration pneumonia (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for
   2-3 days until Cx data is back and continue to follow w/ CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of
   free water.
   - continue IV fluids (D51/2NS) with LR as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   - continue free water flushes via OG (150ml Q4H), transition to PO
   water when able and hydrate to thirst.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status.
   - repeat CXR to assess ET tube position
   - consider bronchoscopy given thick secretions
   - would also consider that she may have been taking narcotics at home;
   of note, she is not as well compensated as one would expect for someone
   her age (CO2 in 30s)
   - will wean down narcotics today, and if doing well will extubate
   today.
   # Altered mental status:
   Most likely toxic-metabolic in setting of DKA, dehydration.  CT head
   negative for acute process.  Although she has facial edema, no blood
   was found behind TMs, so this is most likely from IV fluids
   - f/u final CT read
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr unknown, Cr on presentation 2.1
   Cr has improved to 1.3 then 1.0 with IV fluids.  Would not be surprised
   if she had some ATN from hypotension, but seems to be doing well.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Anemia:  Current Hct 28.1 down slightly from 31, baseline not known.
   Unclear if acute or chronic.  Likely still somewhat hemoconcentrated.
   - send type and screen
   - follow HCTs
   # FEN: IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as detailed above
   # Access:  has left IJ from OSH, will need to remove in < 24 hours; PIV
   x 1, will obtain more PIV access
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine
   # Comm:  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1216**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1217**]??

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient presented to St. Luke's Hospital multiple times with DKA due to poor medication compliance. On this admission, she developed fevers after being transferred to another facility, which were likely secondary events such as aspiration during intubation. Other potential triggers for her condition include infection, pancreatitis, pregnancy, or cardiac ischemia. 

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. She is receiving insulin through a continuous infusion and IV fluids to treat DKA and correct electrolyte imbalances. Blood and urine cultures have been sent to investigate the cause of her fevers. The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of free water.

The patient's altered mental status is most likely toxic-metabolic in the setting of DKA and dehydration. A CT head was negative for any acute processes. The patient has facial edema, but no blood was found behind the TMs, suggesting that this is most likely from IV fluids.

The patient's renal function has improved from an initial creatinine level of 2.1 to 1.3 and then to 1.0 with IV fluids. It is unclear if she has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood sugar levels, elevated ketone levels, and metabolic acidosis indicate DKA. This condition requires immediate medical attention and treatment with intravenous fluids, insulin, and electrolyte management.

2. Fever: The patient's temperature is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. It is important to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is above the normal range, which may be due to the underlying conditions such as DKA, infection, or other causes. Close monitoring of the heart rate and cardiac status is necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels in their blood, indicating dehydration or imbalances in water and electrolytes. This condition needs to be corrected carefully to avoid complications.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Immediate assessment of renal function and appropriate management, including fluid resuscitation and medication adjustments, are necessary.

6. Chronic anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, suggesting chronic anemia. Further evaluation of the cause and appropriate management, including blood transfusions if necessary, should be considered.

The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management by a healthcare professional. Immediate"

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications given
   history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA and possible
   infectious source.  Of note, she did not develop fevers until transfer
   to [**Hospital1 **] so this was most likely a secondary event such as an aspiration
   in the setting of intubation; pt has remained afebrile since
   admission.  Also considered other sources of infection (blood, urine),
   pancreatitis, pregnancy, or cardiac ischemia as possible triggers. CEx3
   negative. [**Doctor First Name 293**]/lipase moderate elevated, but not likely indicative of
   pancreatitis. UCG negative and blood and urine cx are pending.
   - continue insulin gtt until gap has closed and patient is able to
   tolerate PO
   - continue D5 at 75ml/hr, consider switching to D51/2NS. Use boluses of
   LR for volume repletion (hypotension/tachy) if necessary.
   - monitor Q4H chemistries for hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia
   - A-line placed, will monitor frequent ABGs
   - check EKG, Posm, and urine for ketones
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   - check triglycerides
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation, yet afebrile since
   admission,
black
 productive cough. Urine Legionella neg, other
   cultures pending. Patient received vanc, flagyl, and levo at OSH prior
   to transfer.
   - f/u culture data from [**Hospital 1215**] (if drawn)
   - UCx, BCx, sputum Cx were resent, pending results.
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue vanc/levo for likely aspiration pneumonia (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for
   2-3 days  until Cx data is back and continue to follow w/ CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of
   free water, improving Na with free water deficit today is 0.7 L
   - continue IV fluids (D51/2NS) with LR as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   - will transition to PO water when able and hydrate to thirst.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status,
   extubated on [**9-21**] [**1-25**] to improving mental status and ABG.
   - would also consider that she may have been taking narcotics at home;
   of note, she is not as well compensated as one would expect for someone
   her age (CO2 in 30s)
   - continue to monitor O2 on RA.
   # Altered mental status/Agitation:
   Altered Mental Status likely toxic-metabolic in setting of DKA,
   dehydration.  CT of head negative for acute process.  Facial edema upon
   admission most likely from IV fluids. Seen by psych for agitation; diff
   dx includes delirium, possible bipolar d/o decompensation, drug
   induced/withdrawal.
-Per psych, Haldol 5mg IV, Ativan 2mg IV PRN agitation (with Cogentin 1mg PRN).
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr unknown, Cr on presentation 2.1, Cr improving with
   currently at 0.8 with IV fluids.  ARF most likely [**1-25**] to prerenal
   causes such as hypotension/dehydration, adequate urine output.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down from 28.9
28.1
27.2, baseline not known,
   Unclear if acute or chronic.  Likely still somewhat hemoconcentrated.
   - send type and screen
   - follow HCTs
   -consider guaiac stool
   # FEN: IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as detailed above
   # Access:  has left IJ from OSH, will need to remove in < 24 hours; PIV
   x 1, will obtain more PIV access
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was extubated on September 21 and started on regular insulin. The patient reported pain in her left knee, neck, lower back, and stomach. She also mentioned coughing up dark, black sputum. Allergies include penicillins, codeine, Vicodin (oral), morphine, and rash. The patient received haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation and dilaudid IV for pain. Psychiatric evaluation suggested possible delirium, bipolar decompensation, or drug withdrawal. 

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA most likely due to poor medication compliance. The precipitating cause is likely poor compliance with medications, history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA, and possible infectious source. Other sources of infection (blood, urine), pancreatitis, pregnancy, or cardiac ischemia were also considered but ruled out.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to poor mental status and extubated on September 21. She remains on room air and continues to be monitored.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss"

   history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA and possible
   infectious source.  Of note, she did not develop fevers until transfer
   to [**Hospital1 **] so this was most likely a secondary event such as an aspiration
   in the setting of intubation; pt has remained afebrile since
   admission.  Also considered other sources of infection (blood, urine),
   pancreatitis ([**Doctor First Name 293**]/lipase moderate elevated, but not likely indicative
   of pancreatitis), pregnancy (UCG negative), or cardiac ischemia (CEx3
   negative) as possible triggers. Blood and urine cx are pending.
   - continue insulin 2unit/hr gtt for 2-3hrs until patient tolerates PO
   and then switch to glargine 24units SC qday
   - continue D5 at 75ml/hr until d/c insulin gtt and then switch to NS at
   75cc/hr.
   - FSBS q2hr
   - monitor Q4H chemistries for hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and will
   replete as needed.
   - A-line placed, will recheck ABG considering low pO2 which is does not
   match clinical presentation, will d/c A-Line if ABG is within normal
   limits
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   - check triglycerides
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation and possible CAP,
   yet afebrile since admission, c/o
black
 productive cough, CXR shows
   small R infiltrate. Urine Legionella neg, other cultures pending.
   Patient received vanc, flagyl, and levo at OSH prior to transfer.
   - f/u culture data from [**Hospital 1215**] (if drawn)
   - UCx, BCx, sputum Cx were resent, pending results.
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue levo for total of 5days (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for possible asp PNA or
   CAP. Will follow cultures and CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of
   free water, improving Na with free water deficit today at 0.7 L
   - continue IV fluids (D5) with LR boluses as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   - will encourage PO water and hydrate to thirst.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status,
   extubated on [**9-21**] [**1-25**] to improving mental status and ABG.
   - would also consider that she may have been taking narcotics at home;
   of note, she is not as well compensated as one would expect for someone
   her age (CO2 in 30s)
   - continue to monitor O2 on RA.
   # Altered mental status/Agitation:
   Altered Mental Status likely toxic-metabolic in setting of DKA,
   dehydration.  CT of head negative for acute process.  Facial edema upon
   admission most likely from IV fluids. Seen by psych for agitation; diff
   dx includes delirium, possible bipolar d/o decompensation, drug
   induced/withdrawal.
-Per psych, Haldol 5mg IV, Ativan 2mg IV PRN agitation (with Cogentin 1mg PRN).
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr unknown, Cr on presentation 2.1, Cr improving with
   currently at 0.8 with IV fluids.  ARF most likely [**1-25**] to prerenal
   causes such as hypotension/dehydration, adequate urine output.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down from 28.9
28.1

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was extubated on 9/21 and has been agitated with delirium, possible bipolar disorder decompensation, or drug-induced/withdrawal symptoms. The patient has also been experiencing cough with dark, black sputum, and has a small right lung infiltrate on chest X-ray. She received antibiotics, Flagyl, and Levo at OSH prior to transfer. She will continue on Levo for a total of 5 days for possible aspiration pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia. Her sodium levels are elevated due to diuresis from partially treated DKA, and she is receiving IV fluids with LR boluses as needed. The patient was intubated for airway protection due to poor mental status but was successfully extubated on 9/21. She is currently on RA with O2 supplementation. Her creatinine levels are improving from ARF, likely due to prerenal causes such as hypotension/dehydration. Other concerns include anemia, hypernatremia, and altered mental status. The patient's access includes a left IJ line from OSH, which will need to be removed in less than 24 hours."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The precipitating cause of DKA was likely poor compliance with medication, as she has a history of frequent presentations with DKA. She also has signs of respiratory failure, which may have been due to aspiration during intubation, although she has remained afebrile since admission. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to toxic-metabolic causes related to DKA and dehydration. There are no acute findings on the head CT. The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), most likely caused by prerenal factors such as hypotension and dehydration. Her hemoglobin concentration is trending down, and it is unclear if this is acute or chronic anemia. The patient requires further evaluation and treatment for potential infectious causes, including aspiration pneumonia and sepsis. She also needs close monitoring of electrolyte levels and hydration status."

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications given
   history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA and possible
   infectious source.  Of note, she did not develop fevers until transfer
   to [**Hospital1 **] so this was most likely a secondary event such as an aspiration
   in the setting of intubation; pt has remained afebrile since
   admission.  Also considered other sources of infection (blood, urine),
   pancreatitis ([**Doctor First Name 293**]/lipase moderate elevated, but not likely indicative
   of pancreatitis), pregnancy (UCG negative), or cardiac ischemia (CEx3
   negative) as possible triggers. Blood and urine cx are pending.
   - continue insulin 2unit/hr gtt for 2-3hrs until patient tolerates PO
   and then switch to glargine 24units SC qday
   - continue D5 at 75ml/hr until d/c insulin gtt and then switch to NS at
   75cc/hr.
   - FSBS q2hr
   - monitor Q4H chemistries for hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and will
   replete as needed.
   - A-line placed, will recheck ABG considering elevated lactate and low
   pO2 which is does not match clinical presentation
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   - check triglycerides
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation and possible CAP,
   yet afebrile since admission, c/o
black
 productive cough, CXR shows
   small R infiltrate. Urine Legionella neg, other cultures pending.
   Patient received vanc, flagyl, and levo at OSH prior to transfer.
   - f/u culture data from [**Hospital 1215**] (if drawn)
   - UCx, BCx, sputum Cx were resent, pending results.
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue levo for total of 5days (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for possible asp PNA or
   CAP. Will follow cultures and CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of
   free water, improving Na with free water deficit today at 0.7 L
   - continue IV fluids (D5) with LR boluses as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   - will encourage PO water and hydrate to thirst.
   -continue to monitor electrolytes q4hr
   #Hypokalemia:
   Most likely [**1-25**] to intracellular transfer with correction of DKA and
   insulin.
   -continue to monitor lytes q4hr and replete as needed.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status,
   extubated on [**2172-9-21**] [**1-25**] to improving mental status, patient has been
   saturating well in the high 90
s and has improved clinically despite
   ABG pO2 of 47 which is most likely [**1-25**] to poor ABG draw.
   - will repeat ABG
   - continue to monitor O2 on RA.
   # Altered mental status/Agitation/Psych:
   Altered mental status is improved as pt is alert and oriented; AMS
   likely toxic-metabolic in setting of DKA, dehydration, CT of head
   negative for acute process, Facial edema upon admission most likely
   from IV fluids. Seen by psych for agitation; diff dx includes delirium,
   possible bipolar d/o decompensation, drug induced/withdrawal.
-Per psych, Haldol 5mg IV, Ativan 2mg IV PRN agitation (with Cogentin 1mg PRN).
-Will check TSH, B12, and folate per psych rec.
-Consider addition of home psych meds of Abilify and Celexa per psych rec
#Left Knee Pain:
c/o of left knee pain [**1-25**] to referred pain from IO in the field by EMS, no s/s i
nfection in joint
-Continue Dilaudid PO
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr unknown, Cr on presentation 2.1, Cr improving with
   currently at 0.8 with IV fluids.  ARF most likely [**1-25**] to prerenal
   causes such as hypotension/dehydration, adequate urine output.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down from 28.9
28.1
27.2 most likely [**1-25**] to
   hemodilution with increased IVF.
   - follow HCTs
   #Hypothyroidism:
   -will check TSH
   -Continue levothyroxine
   # FEN: IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as detailed above; will
   begin [**Doctor First Name **] diet PO.
   # Access:  has left IJ from OSH, will need to remove in < 24 hours; PIV
   (20gauge) x 1, d/c A-line in Right Radial
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine
   # Comm:  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1216**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1217**]??
   patient's home number  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1218**]

","The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The precipitating cause of DKA is likely poor compliance with medications. She presented with respiratory failure, intubated and extubated on 9/21. She also has altered mental status, agitation, and cough with dark, black sputum. The patient's abdomen is soft with no tenderness, and she has peripheral pulses that are +2 bilaterally without edema. Her neurological examination shows normal sensation in both upper and lower extremities, but decreased strength in the left lower extremity due to pain.

Laboratory results indicate hyperglycemia, elevated hemoglobin A1c, leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated lactate, and elevated troponin I. Renal function tests show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Electrolyte imbalances include hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia.

The patient's fever is most likely due to aspiration in the setting of intubation, although other sources of infection are being evaluated. The small right infiltrate seen on chest X-ray may indicate possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Cultures are pending, and she has received vancomycin, Flagyl, and levofloxacin at the outside hospital.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has been in the ICU and has received treatment for DKA, fever, tachycardia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and chronic anemia. The patient's condition has improved, with the closure of the DKA gap, resolution of fever, and improvement in renal function. The patient is now ready to advance to breakfast and start long-acting insulin (Glargine) with a 2-3 hour overlap.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of DKA: Despite the patient's current improvement, there is a risk of recurrence if blood sugar levels are not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient had a previous infection with Legionella in the urine, so there is a possibility of developing other infections while in the ICU.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, there is still a risk of AKI developing due to factors such as hypotension or nephrotoxic medications.
4. Hypoglycemia: With the initiation of long-acting insulin (Glargine), there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the dosing is not adjusted appropriately.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT while immobile in the ICU. Pro"

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications given
   history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA and possible
   infectious source.  Of note, she did not develop fevers until transfer
   to [**Hospital1 **] so this was most likely a secondary event such as an aspiration
   in the setting of intubation; pt has remained afebrile since
   admission.  Also considered other sources of infection (blood, urine),
   pancreatitis ([**Doctor First Name 293**]/lipase moderate elevated, but not likely indicative
   of pancreatitis), pregnancy (UCG negative), or cardiac ischemia (CEx3
   negative) as possible triggers. Blood and urine cx are pending.
   - continue insulin 2unit/hr gtt for 2-3hrs until patient tolerates PO
   and then switch to glargine 24units SC qday with overlap between
   insulin and glargine
   - continue D5 at 75ml/hr until d/c insulin gtt and then switch to NS at
   75cc/hr.
   - FSBS q2hr
   - monitor Q4H chemistries for hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and will
   replete as needed.
   - A-line d/c
ed yet will recheck ABG considering elevated lactate and
   low pO2, it is noted that these values do not match clinical
   presentation
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation and possible CAP,
   yet afebrile since admission, c/o
black
 productive cough, CXR shows
   small R infiltrate. Urine Legionella neg, other cultures pending.
   Patient received vanc, flagyl, and levo at OSH prior to transfer.
   - f/u culture data from [**Hospital 1215**] (if drawn)
   - UCx, BCx, sputum Cx were resent, pending results.
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue levo for total of 5days (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for possible asp PNA or
   CAP. D/c Vanco. Will follow cultures and CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of
   free water, improving Na with free water deficit today at 0.7 L
   - continue IV fluids (D5) with LR boluses as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   - will encourage PO water and hydrate to thirst.
   -continue to monitor electrolytes q4hr
   #Hypokalemia:
   Most likely [**1-25**] to intracellular transfer with correction of DKA and
   insulin along with unmasking of underlying hypokalemia after insulin
   therapy
   -continue to monitor lytes q4hr and replete as needed.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status,
   extubated on [**2172-9-21**] [**1-25**] to improving mental status, patient has been
   saturating well in the high 90
s and has improved clinically despite
   ABG pO2 of 47 which is most likely [**1-25**] to poor ABG draw.
   - will repeat ABG
   - continue to monitor O2 on RA.
   # Altered mental status/Agitation/Psych:
   Altered mental status is improved as pt is alert and oriented; AMS
   likely toxic-metabolic in setting of DKA, dehydration, CT of head
   negative for acute process, Facial edema upon admission most likely
   from IV fluids. Seen by psych for agitation; diff dx includes delirium,
   possible bipolar d/o decompensation, drug induced/withdrawal.
-Per psych, Haldol 5mg IV, Ativan 2mg IV PRN agitation (with Cogentin 1mg PRN).
-Will check TSH, B12, and folate per psych rec.
-Consider addition of home psych meds of Abilify and Celexa per psych rec
#Left Knee Pain:
c/o of left knee pain [**1-25**] to referred pain from IO in the field by EMS, no s/s i
nfection in joint
-Continue Dilaudid PO
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr unknown, Cr on presentation 2.1, Cr improving with
   currently at 0.8 with IV fluids.  ARF most likely [**1-25**] to prerenal
   causes such as hypotension/dehydration, adequate urine output.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down from 28.9
28.1
27.2 most likely [**1-25**] to
   hemodilution with increased IVF.
   - follow HCTs
   #Hypothyroidism:
   -will check TSH
   -Continue levothyroxine
   # FEN: IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as detailed above; will
   begin [**Doctor First Name **] diet PO.
   # Access:  has left IJ from OSH, will need to remove in < 24 hours; PIV
   (20gauge) x 1, d/c A-line in Right Radial
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine

   Resident Addendum:
   I was present on rounds and examined the patient with the team.  Agree
   with excellent MS 4 note above.  Will give glargine and continue
   insulin gtt for 3 more hours.  Appreciate input from endocrine and
   psychiatry; we will work to restart her home celexa and abilify.
   Obtain repeat ABG.  She will need outpatient anemia work-up.

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The precipitating cause of her DKA was non-compliance with her insulin regimen. She received insulin infusions and was also treated for potential infections, including aspiration pneumonia. She has shown improvement clinically, but still requires close monitoring and management of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels may continue to fluctuate, requiring close monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient has been found to have low potassium levels, which may require repletion and ongoing monitoring.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels due to dehydration associated with DKA. Free water deficit needs to be addressed to correct this electrolyte imbalance.
4. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated and is saturating well on room air, there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if she develops any complications such as pneumonia or aspiration.
5. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient may still be at risk for developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bloodstream infections.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down, indicating possible anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
7. Thyroid dysfunction:"

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications given
   history of frequent presentations to St Lukes' with DKA and possible
   infectious source.  Of note, she did not develop fevers until transfer
   to [**Hospital1 **] so this was most likely a secondary event such as an aspiration
   in the setting of intubation; pt has remained afebrile since
   admission.  Also considered other sources of infection (blood, urine),
   pancreatitis ([**Doctor First Name 293**]/lipase moderate elevated, but not likely indicative
   of pancreatitis), pregnancy (UCG negative), or cardiac ischemia (CEx3
   negative) as possible triggers. Blood and urine cx are pending.
   - continue insulin 2unit/hr gtt for 2-3hrs until patient tolerates PO
   and then switch to glargine 24units SC qday
   - continue D5 at 75ml/hr until d/c insulin gtt and then switch to NS at
   75cc/hr.
   - FSBS q2hr
   - monitor Q4H chemistries for hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and will
   replete as needed.
   - A-line placed, will recheck ABG considering elevated lactate and low
   pO2 which is does not match clinical presentation
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   - check triglycerides
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation and possible CAP,
   yet afebrile since admission, c/o
black
 productive cough, CXR shows
   small R infiltrate. Urine Legionella neg, other cultures pending.
   Patient received vanc, flagyl, and levo at OSH prior to transfer.
   - f/u culture data from [**Hospital 1215**] (if drawn)
   - UCx, BCx, sputum Cx were resent, pending results.
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue levo for total of 5days (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for possible asp PNA or
   CAP. D/c Vanco. Will follow cultures and CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Most likely from partially treated DKA causing diuresis with loss of
   free water, improving Na with free water deficit today at 0.7 L
   - continue IV fluids (D5) with LR boluses as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   - will encourage PO water and hydrate to thirst.
   -continue to monitor electrolytes q4hr
   #Hypokalemia:
   Most likely [**1-25**] to intracellular transfer with correction of DKA and
   insulin.
   -continue to monitor lytes q4hr and replete as needed.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status,
   extubated on [**2172-9-21**] [**1-25**] to improving mental status, patient has been
   saturating well in the high 90
s and has improved clinically despite
   ABG pO2 of 47 which is most likely [**1-25**] to poor ABG draw.
   - will repeat ABG
   - continue to monitor O2 on RA.
   # Altered mental status/Agitation/Psych:
   Altered mental status is improved as pt is alert and oriented; AMS
   likely toxic-metabolic in setting of DKA, dehydration, CT of head
   negative for acute process, Facial edema upon admission most likely
   from IV fluids. Seen by psych for agitation; diff dx includes delirium,
   possible bipolar d/o decompensation, drug induced/withdrawal.
-Per psych, Haldol 5mg IV, Ativan 2mg IV PRN agitation (with Cogentin 1mg PRN).
-Will check TSH, B12, and folate per psych rec.

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She presented multiple times to St. Luke's with DKA and possible infectious sources. The precipitating cause of her DKA is likely poor compliance with medications. She did not develop fevers until transfer to Hospital1, suggesting a secondary event such as aspiration during intubation. She has remained afebrile since admission.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 129/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her physical examination reveals tachycardia, regular heart rhythm, and a systolic murmur at the base and left sternal border. Her lungs are clear, and she has no abnormal findings in the abdomen or extremities. She has yellowish discoloration of the urine.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose levels, and lactate levels. Her sodium levels are high, potassium levels are low, and magnesium levels are within normal range. Her blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum culture are pending.

Plan:
1. Continue insulin infusion for 2-3 hours until the patient tolerates oral intake, then switch to Glargine 24"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who presented to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

The patient's recent events include respiratory failure that necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation, but she was successfully extubated on September 21st. She experienced increased agitation and delirium, which were likely due to DKA, dehydration, and possibly withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Psychiatric evaluation suggested delirium or bipolar decompensation, and she was treated with haloperidol and ativan as needed.

The patient also complained of various pains, including stomach pain related to gastroparesis and left knee pain, which she attributed to referred pain from an intraoperative (IO) procedure. There were no signs of infection in the joint.

Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 129/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits at 9 mmHg. She has received aggressive fluid resuscitation with intravenous fluids, including D5W and normal saline, and has shown improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications, possible
   other etiology is infection (including CAP). Pt
s electrolytes
   stabilized, with decrease in lactate from 3
1.8. D/c
ed insulin gtt,
   pt on glargine/lantus, d/c
ed D5W and tolerating PO well.
   - continue glargine 24units SC qday; RISS
   - PO intake for fluids
   - FSBS q2hr
   - monitor chemistries q12 and will replete as needed.
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   #Lactic Acidosis:
   Elevated lactate yesterday, possible etiologies include mesenteric
   ischemia (secondary to hypovolemia and decreased bowel perfusion;
   unlikely given no acute process in CT of abdomen), and residual lactic
   acidosis from DKA/resp failure. Lactate trending down to WNL this am.
   -Continue to monitor lactate
   -Continue to monitor vitals and resp status.
   # Fevers:
   Suspect patient aspirated in setting of intubation, possible CAP, or
   knee infection. low grade temp ON. Urine Legionella neg, other cultures
   pending. D/c
ed Vanco, on Levo (Day #4)
   - UCx, BCx, sputum Cx pending results.
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue levo for total of 5days (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for possible asp PNA or
   CAP. D/c Vanco yest. Will follow cultures and CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Resolving, most likely secondary to loss of free water following DKA
   treatment.
   - PO intake to hydrate thirst, LR boluses as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   -continue to monitor electrolytes q12hr
   #Hypokalemia:
   Resolved. Most likely [**1-25**] to intracellular transfer with correction of
   DKA and insulin along with unmasking of underlying hypokalemia after
   insulin therapy.
   -continue to monitor lytes q12hr and replete as needed.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status,
   extubated on [**2172-9-21**] [**1-25**] to improving mental status, patient has been
   saturating well in the high 90
   - continue to monitor O2 on RA.
   # Altered mental status/Agitation/Psych:
   Pt continues to have intermittent episodes of agitation; Seen by psych
   with recs as below. Began home regimen of Abilify and Celexa yest
-Per psych, Haldol 5mg IV, Ativan 2mg IV PRN agitation (with Cogentin 1mg PRN).
Minimize interventions, increase pt control by offering choices, contact PCP wit
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] regards to confirming outpatient pain management, obtain social work c/s re di
spo, and team/family meeting prior to d/c. Will follow out recommendations.
-Ct Abilify and Celexa; will begin alprazolam. 0.5mg TID
#Left Knee Pain:
Continues to c/o of left knee pain; considering low grade temp and continuing pa
in, possible etiology includes septic joint. Other possibility of pain is referr
ed pain from IO in the field by EMS. Xray showed no acute process.
-Urine GC
-Will attempt aspiration of joint to assess for infection.
-Continue Dilaudid PO for pain.
   # ARF:  Cr on presentation 2.1, Cr improving with currently at 0.6.
   ARF most likely [**1-25**] to prerenal causes such as hypotension/dehydration,
   adequate urine output.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Anemia:  Hct stabilizing, currently at 27.5
   - follow HCTs
   #Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The precipitating cause of her DKA was likely poor medication compliance, with possible other etiologies including infection, such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Her electrolytes have been stabilized, and she has shown improvement. She has been started on glargine/lantus insulin and is tolerating oral intake well. 

Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient presented with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when there is insufficient insulin in the body. It can lead to high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and acidosis. The patient's DKA was treated with insulin therapy and fluid resuscitation.
2. Lactic Acidosis: The patient had elevated lactate levels, which could be due to mesenteric ischemia or residual lactic acidosis from DKA/resp failure. However, her lactate levels are now trending down to normal.
3. Fevers: The patient has had intermittent fevers, suspecting aspiration in the setting of intubation, possible CAP, or knee infection. Cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated empirically with antibiotics.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which is likely secondary to loss of free water following DKA treatment. She"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was likely noncompliant with her medications, which led to the development of DKA. The patient's electrolytes have been stabilized, and she has been weaned off insulin drip and started on Lantus/Glargine. She is tolerating oral intake well.

The patient continues to experience left knee pain, which may be due to septic arthritis or referred pain from an intravenous line. She has been given pain medication for relief. The patient's mental status is still intermittent and agitated, so she is being monitored closely by the psychiatric team. She has been prescribed Abilify and Celexa for her condition.

The patient has a history of altered mental status and aspiration, but she is currently not febrile. A chest X-ray showed a small right infiltrate, which may indicate possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). She is being treated with Levoflaxacin, and cultures are pending. 

The patient's sodium levels were elevated, likely due to loss of free water following DKA treatment. She is being encouraged to consume oral fluids and receive intravenous fluids as needed for volume resuscitation.

Her potassium levels were initially low but have resolved. She is being monitored for any electrolyte imbalances and will be repleted as necessary.

The patient was intubated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She underwent intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, including insulin therapy, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte management. The patient's condition improved, and she was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin (glargine/lantus) and tolerating oral intake well. However, she still experiences epigastric pain and nausea after eating. She also reports moderate pain in her left knee, which has not changed since yesterday. A CT scan of the abdomen showed no acute intrabdominal etiology for her pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with normal blood glucose levels. Her respiratory status is also improving, as indicated by normal arterial blood gas (ABG) results. The patient's mental status has resolved, and she is now alert and oriented. She has been extubated and is maintaining adequate oxygen saturation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lactic Acidosis: The patient had elevated lactate levels yesterday, which could be due to ongoing DKA, mesenteric ischemia, or hypoxia related to respiratory failure. It is important to monitor her ABG and vital signs for any signs of worsening lactic acidosis.
2. Fevers: The patient initially had fevers, but she has been afebrile since admission. A small right infiltr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently being treated for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute renal failure. The patient also has hypernatremia, anemia, and fever. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 126/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's pain is controlled, and he is responding well to treatment. The patient underwent a CT abdomen which showed no acute intrabdominal etiology for his pain. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Monitoring for symptoms of fluid overload such as shortness of breath, edema, and hypertension is important.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and treatment for DKA increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent and manage hypoglycemia.
4. Worsening renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo woman with h/o IDDM admitted with DKA most likely due to poor
   medication compliance.
   # DKA:
   Resolved. Precipitating cause likely poor compliance with medications,
   possible other etiology is infection (including CAP). Pt
s electrolytes
   stabilized with decrease in lactate from 3
1.8. D/c
ed insulin gtt
   yest, pt on glargine, d/c
ed D5W and tolerating PO well.
   - continue glargine 24units SC qday; RISS; will discuss with [**Last Name (un) 72**]
   about additional insulin recs
   - PO intake for fluids
   - FSBS q2hr
   - monitor chemistries q12 and will replete as needed.
   - continue work-up for possible infectious cause as discussed below
   #Lactic Acidosis:
   Elevated lactate yesterday, possible etiologies include mesenteric
   ischemia (secondary to hypovolemia and decreased bowel perfusion;
   unlikely given no acute process in CT of abdomen), and residual lactic
   acidosis from DKA/resp failure. Lactate trending down to WNL this am.
   -Continue to monitor lactate
   -Continue to monitor vitals and resp status.
   # Fevers:
   Low grade temp ON. Possible etiologies of ON fever include knee
   infection and PNA (CAP or aspiration). Urine Legionella neg, other
   cultures pending. D/c
ed Vanco, on Levo (Day #4)
   - UCx, BCx, sputum Cx pending results.
   - Given large amount of thick secretions and risk of aspiration, will
   continue levo for total of 5days (day 1 = [**9-20**]) for possible asp PNA or
   CAP. D/c Vanco yest. Will follow cultures and CXRs.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Resolving, most likely secondary to loss of free water following DKA
   treatment.
   - PO intake to hydrate thirst, LR boluses as needed for volume
   resuscitation
   -continue to monitor electrolytes q12hr
   #Hypokalemia:
   Resolved. Most likely [**1-25**] to intracellular transfer with correction of
   DKA and insulin along with unmasking of underlying hypokalemia after
   insulin therapy.
   -continue to monitor lytes q12hr and replete as needed.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated for airway protection in setting of poor mental status,
   extubated on [**2172-9-21**] [**1-25**] to improving mental status, patient has been
   saturating well in the high 90

-Ct Abilify and Celexa; will begin alprazolam. 0.5mg TID
#Left Knee Pain:
Continues to c/o of left knee pain; considering low grade temp and continuing pa
in, possible etiology includes septic joint. Other possibility of pain is referr
ed pain from IO in the field by EMS. Xray showed no acute process.
-Urine GC
-Will attempt aspiration of joint to assess for infection.
-Continue Dilaudid PO for pain.
   # ARF:  Cr on presentation 2.1, Cr improving with currently at 0.6.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's DKA has resolved, and she is now on Lantus/glargine insulin. Her electrolyte levels have stabilized, and she is tolerating oral intake well. However, she still experiences pain in her left knee, which may be due to a septic joint or referred pain from a previous injury. The patient also has an altered mental status and has been agitated, requiring psychiatric consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Lactic Acidosis: The patient had elevated lactate levels, possibly due to mesenteric ischemia or residual lactic acidosis from DKA/respiratory failure. Lactate is now trending down, but the patient should continue to be monitored for any signs of lactic acidosis.

2. Fevers: The patient has had low-grade temperatures, which could be caused by a knee infection or pneumonia (CAP or aspiration). Urine Legionella is negative, and other cultures are pending. The patient will continue to be monitored, and antibiotics will be adjusted based on culture results.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are resolving, most likely due to loss of free water following DKA treatment. The patient should continue to be hydrated with oral intake and receive LR boluses as needed for volume resuscitation.

The patient is a 21-year-old with a long history of diabetes mellitus and non-compliance presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's condition has been managed in the ICU, and various interventions have been performed. The patient's fever, lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, and hypoglycemia have resolved. However, there are ongoing concerns regarding potential medical complications such as anemia, chronic, knee infection, acute psychosis, and potential infection at the site of an intraosseous (IO) line placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia, Chronic: The patient has chronic anemia, which may be related to their long-standing diabetes mellitus. It is important to monitor and manage this condition appropriately.

2. Knee Infection: The patient is experiencing knee pain and has a possible infection. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the extent and cause of the infection.

3. Acute Psychosis: The patient is exhibiting signs of agitation and may require psychiatric follow-up for further evaluation and management of their acute psychosis.

4. Infection at IO Line Placement: There is a possibility of infection at the site of the IO line placement. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent or treat any potential infection.

5. DKA: Although the patient's DKA has improved, it is important to continue monitoring their glycemic control and adjust insulin therapy as needed to prevent recurrence.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old with a long history of diabetes mellitus and non-compliance who presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient was admitted to the ICU, where they received treatment for DKA, including insulin therapy and fluid resuscitation. The patient's fever resolved within 24 hours, and they were started on antibiotics due to concerns of aspiration pneumonia. Lactic acidosis was also observed but is expected to improve with ongoing treatment. The patient's renal function improved with hydration and is now considered resolved. There were concerns about potential knee pain, and an intraosseous line was placed, but further evaluation through knee films is pending. The patient's serum potassium and phosphate levels are low and are being repleted. The patient's agitation has improved, but they may require a psychiatric evaluation before discharge. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient initially presented with DKA, which is a serious condition characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications such as cerebral edema, organ damage, and even death.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient was started on antibiotics due to concerns of aspiration"
