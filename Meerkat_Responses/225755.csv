 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION: Initially met SIRS criteria based
   on fevers, tachycardia and leukocytosis, now fevers and tachycardia
   resolved, leukocytosis improved. Noninvasive blood pressures have
   remained stable. Although no change in biliary dilitation, cholangitis
   is most likely etiology.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction and polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis. She presented with fever and altered mental status, which is concerning for ascending cholangitis. The patient's lactate level is still elevated at 3.8, indicating possible inadequate tissue perfusion. She has been febrile despite receiving antibiotics, and her uop has been low, requiring a bolus. An ERCP procedure was performed, revealing stent obstruction by stones and sludge, which were removed using a balloon. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low oxygen saturation. Her blood cultures indicate growth of GNR. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications such as pantoprazole, acetaminophen, carbidopa-levodopa, pramipexole, insulin, and simvastatin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient initially met SIRS criteria due to fevers, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, but now only has resolved fevers and tachycardia. Continuous monitoring and prompt management are necessary to prevent the progression to septic shock.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR was initially supratherapeutic, which could increase the risk of bleeding during invasive procedures. Restarting and adjusting the dose of coumadin is essential for maintaining appropriate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis, presenting with fever, altered mental status, and suspected ascending cholangitis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5%), heart rate of 118 bpm (69-129 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 139/81 mmHg to 140/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (18-34 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, bilateral edema, and altered mental status. 

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and Parkinson's disease. The patient's goals of care include providing comfort and avoiding unnecessary interventions, as indicated by the do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include sepsis, organ dysfunction, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, malignancy, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition is currently improving, with improved mentation, blood pressure, and heart rate. However, the patient's lactate and urine output are dropping, indicating possible worsening of organ function. The patient requires continued antibiotic therapy, further evaluation for hepatic abscesses, and close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with fever and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholelithiasis, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the gallbladder and cholangiocarcinoma, and cholangitis. The patient's condition has improved after ERCP and clearing of obstruction, but she remains tachycardic with minimal urine output. She has allergies to penicillins and rashes.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's presentation with fever, altered mental status, and bacteremia indicates an infection that has led to sepsis. Immediate management should focus on antibiotic therapy and source control.
2. Cholelithiasis: The presence of gallstones can cause complications such as biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, or choledocholithiasis if stones pass into the common bile duct.
3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm): The patient has been diagnosed with gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. This will require further evaluation and treatment planning, potentially involving an oncology consultation.
4. Cholangitis: The patient's symptoms suggest an infection of the bile ducts, which may lead to complications like hepatic abscesses or worsening sepsis.

   - continue Linezolid and Meropenem per ID recs. [**Month (only) 8**] dc Linezolid if VRE
   doesn

   - s/p ERCP with stone and sludge removal.
   - will need CT scan to evaluate for hepatic abscesses to determine
   length of antibiotic course
   - minimal access (1 PIV)-> will try to get another PIV and PICC once
   24hrs afebrile. If clinically worsens may require CVL. Unclear if
   pressors are indicated as ERCP cleaning is likely ultimately the most
   effective way to solve the underlying problem.
   - 1L D5W c 3amps bicarb and reassess.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with fever, altered mental status, and potential ascending cholangitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholelithiasis, cancer (malignant neoplasm), cholangiocarcinoma/gallbladder, and cholangitis.

The patient's condition has improved clinically, with improved mentation, blood pressure, and heart rate. However, there are concerns regarding dropping lactate levels and urine output. The treatment plan includes continuing Linezolid and Meropenem as per ID recommendations, discontinuing Linezolid if VRE does not grow, removing stones and sludge through ERCP, and conducting a CT scan to evaluate for hepatic abscesses to determine the length of antibiotic course.

The patient also has coagulopathy with an initially supratherapeutic INR that has been reversed for ERCP. Anticoagulation is being held off due to the poor prognosis. There are also concerns about oliguria/anuria in the setting of hypotension, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and Parkinson's disease.

The goals of care include discussing PCP today given repeated presentations of sepsis and refraining from restarting anticoagulation. ICU care includes nutrition, glyc"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis, presenting with fever, altered mental status, and potential ascending cholangitis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholelithiasis, cancer (malignant neoplasm), cholangiocarcinoma/gallbladder, and cholangitis.

The patient's condition has improved clinically with the ERCP procedure and clearing of the obstruction. However, she remains tachycardic with minimal urine output. The patient is currently receiving ceftriaxone IV q24h to cover for Klebsiella as the organism and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). A CT scan is planned to evaluate for hepatic abscesses to determine the length of antibiotic course. The patient also has a PICC line for access.

The patient's coagulopathy has been reversed after the ERCP procedure, and anticoagulation will be held off due to the poor prognosis. Oliguria/anuria persists in the setting of hypotension, and maintenance fluids are being given at 100ml/h. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II medications are being held, and blood pressure medications are also being held. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation will be held as well. Parkinson's disease"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, biliary obstruction, and probable metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. She was admitted with Klebsiella cholangitis and sepsis, resulting in altered mental status and coagulopathy. She underwent an ERCP and is currently on meropenem and linezolid. The patient has allergies to penicillins and has a rash as a last dose of antibiotics. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 120/60 to 166/101 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 11.3 to 21.6 thousand cells/mm³, an elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 131 mEq/L. Other laboratory values include elevated glucose levels, increased liver enzymes, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels. 

The patient has multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, oliguria/anuria, Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the gallbladder/cholangiocarcinoma, coagulopathy, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

The plan includes changing the antibiotic to ceftriaxone, addressing decreased urine output, managing atrial fibrillation, and continuing Parkinson's disease medications. The patient is also receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction due to presumed metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. She was admitted with Klebsiella cholangitis/sepsis following an ERCP procedure. The patient's condition has been improving, but she continues to experience intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation (AFib) requiring IV metoprolol. She also has ongoing diarrhea, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, diabetes mellitus type II, oliguria/anuria, Parkinson's disease, AFib, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the gallbladder, coagulopathy, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AFib: The patient's rapid atrial fibrillation may require adjustment in medication dosage and the addition of IV metoprolol. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary.
2. Klebsiella Sepsis: The patient's sepsis needs to be closely monitored for any signs of recurrent infection. Continued administration of CTX (antibiotic) is recommended.
3. Diarrhea: Increased stool output should be evaluated for Clostridium difficile infection. Appropriate measures should be taken to manage diarrhea.
4. Fluid Resuscitation: The patient appears volume depleted with concentrated urine. Fluid resuscitation will be implemented to address this issue.

The patient's condition has been improving clinically after undergoing ERCP and clearing of obstruction. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has a history of polymicrobial bacteremia and is currently being treated with antibiotics. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening sepsis.

2. Cholangitis: The patient initially presented with signs and symptoms of cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. Although the obstruction has been cleared, the patient may still be at risk for complications such as hepatic abscesses or recurrent infection.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is experiencing episodes of tachycardia and has been diagnosed with AFIB. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and manage any associated symptoms or complications.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's initial INR was supratherapeutic, indicating a potential bleeding risk. The patient's coagulation status should continue to be monitored, especially since anticoagulation is being held due to poor oral intake.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis, presenting with fever and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholelithiasis, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the gallbladder, and cholangitis. She has shown improvement after ERCP and clearing of the obstruction. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/91 to 174/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature of 36.4°C. She is on various medications including metoprolol, pantoprazole, furosemide, and antibiotics. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly decreased hematocrit and creatinine levels. The assessment plan includes continuing ceftriaxone, eventually performing a CT scan to evaluate for hepatic abscesses, and considering the length of antibiotic course. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, oliguria/anuria, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and Parkinson's disease.
